The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know either Voldemort or the confectionery.
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has knocked down members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD a little bit, as they dominate the notorious snake, which has become a citizen in the last years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite during the lapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are tapping somewhat in the dark in relation to these new terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paten's vocabulary".
But Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
“This is the only expression of those you present here that I use from time to time.”
"Otherwise, I don't like slang much."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in front of the ODS election congress in June this year, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague Gulf hole", "go to the confectionery", "stairnecks", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to participate in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener away.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things and how the civil democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge on that.”
"It is important to me how we understand each other within the framework of our programs," he countered.
As has already been pointed out, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, in the headline mentioned above, allegedly did not recognize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, was speaking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly coined during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, but added to security: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as the Blanka Tunnel.
However, both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where this figure is to be found and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to any Prague gastronomy business", Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to solving the puzzle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
However, according to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly civic slang among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously we don’t really have that kind of thing.”
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his fellow party members.
"I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke) at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktual<0xC4><0x9B>l<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and look there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention by machinations in the party sponsorship before the elections, is called by some colleagues "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spitznames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the use of internal party language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> reportedly doesn't like to be called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktual<0xC4><0x9B>l<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber-Nut Rights" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> has acquired his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and released a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are unaccompanied and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
“Young and healthy women also remain spared as they help with work and give birth to children,” a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a pamphlet designed to prevent the "witch-stalking".
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the Standard newspaper pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they overflowed her with oil and simply set her on fire.
The incident was reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the case was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointings.
And after the group tried to "expel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here without regard to their education.
“The Standard” quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Fresh women of human souls are a danger earlier than today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president himself duly interfered with the president.
"President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a part in her death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
“To this end, he called on Shamans from nearby Guinea to help those who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President’s bodyguard, forcibly kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the trapped people were forced to drink an absud from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly subordinate man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of a monthly rent of 3,500 crowns, the son is expected to pay 4100 crowns for a 2-bedroom apartment with a second category kitchen next year.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal furnace," he taps with his finger on the son's new lease, to which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explained half-confused and half-resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waved.
"One says this, the other that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a major "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay market-friendly rents so far.
Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine o’clock in the morning on this Tuesday, breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Rent 2011", so a special touch field lights up on the touch screen.
Shortly tapped and already the device spits out a number record.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and it is already beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it’s your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
Starting in mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will fit most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
In the letter, the RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action is over a little over a week, that is, that's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" arrives as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are a breaking topic.
Before the elections, Parliamentary Vice-President Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from Ostrava, from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even the best. Toilet glasses could replace them," the man mentioned at the beginning gets airy.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the switch to see if they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The benefit of a reduced February rent by half should also come to the other tenants who sign the new lease until December 15.
Until now, however, "deregulation switches" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov are anything but overloaded with demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were due here," the shift officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wall panels where it appears necessary.
If the parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,” explains RPG on its website.
"No one is going to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
“I have 13,000 (krona) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court case,” he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Mal see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year’s Day 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is in the opinion of the homeowners the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in housing between 2005 and 2010 from the rents it took, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, in the meantime, some red-lighting information appears again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," reads the LCD monitor.
For 400 apartments in RPG’s portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not spike rents, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenues from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that comes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known buildings in Brno come, counted from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building on the premises for his company’s mini-garden.
In wise anticipation, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is committed to having the designers return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the opportunity to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
It is easier for civil engineers and architects to put their demanding profession and childcare under one roof.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the exhaustion of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are taken care of by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminates the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also formed here.
Arch.Design was thus one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof mutes like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn up fish molars.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "bone house".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the scale-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only with a closer look that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and intertwined shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, and even look holes and slats.
The House of Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, designed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper renovation.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> rental house, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, many other painters and artists also collaborated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house received its organic forms from the local inhabitants because of the nickname "bone house".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gaining house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for the house a central heating system unique for the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
A bit bizarre is already mutating her 45-degree inclination.
During his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was not fooled by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so dismayed by the result that they demanded reparation two years later.
Among other things, the councillors also objected to the fact that the building, with its pillars, even intervened in the public pavement.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> submitted an application for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a company lounge, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building runs a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
But Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors, in addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, through Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s renovation.
Also impressive is Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courtyards.
The play of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum level of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes they were extended to other common rooms and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not cardboard, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist ID cards get a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rest? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bedding - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, size, state of health and not least the gender of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust must be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to “get warm”.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and are still lying on a solid plate, moisture builds up: It is not excluded that mold forms under them.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“Although all the ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep properly here anymore.”
"For their abraded shoulders, heels and hips, they just need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape-memory polymer)."
"I also recommend this among other things to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can poorly receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought these mattresses with visco foam (Memory Foam) for many ice hockey players, but also other customers, years ago.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it flatters directly on the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you do not roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wund fire).
When choosing the mattress size, the length of the soles should still be added to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the master of the upholsterers and interior designer, who has been devoting herself for years to the problems of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own lattice and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are also the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grille in different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mold layer and the fine padding.
"You can't feel the feathers by hand or sitting down," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattresses and underlays such as grown-up Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already happening today.
And since one loses between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) screen after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty, for mattresses.
Every thing has its When and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, detachable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made today with a round zipper, so that after opening you get two halves (immeasurably important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often takes place like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a grid?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already in it) and mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring cores and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
For non-adjustable lattice grids with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for grids with a larger number of lattices, i.e. 28 and more spring bars, with Lordoses support in the lumbar vertebral region and the possibility to adjust the lattice hardness.
Adjustable lamella grids do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips or even to bend them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in punctually.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (Latoflex) or lattice with point elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it.
In the lateral position, the head cushion (along with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils – for example castor oil and soybean oil – are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is for mattresses, which consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent during sleep.
There is also a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppermint stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm during sleep.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have 7000 crowns and more to rake.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is available for free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when warm, in a cool environment it hardens again.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleeping comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently in the traceless disappearance of the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and horror, and so they are looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also at the cost of undermining their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around here, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy," said Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing it, but we haven't had such a case to record so far."
“Most customers really buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Mobile phones initially raised high expectations from parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"With planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate it."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would safely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," claims Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play in a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that this is either about devices in matchbox size that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are therefore being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he only notices this after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle location.
Thus, the combination of location function using the GPS system (just as with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but only hold them for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of cords, ignited with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the STV Group stock company, a. s. for lip 40 million crowns.
In its justification for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60-kilometer ignition cord every year.
According to the investigations of army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES appealed to this, it emerges from this statement that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be justified in half.
This is equivalent to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would suffice for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of every new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has, through these new purchases - even from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units - a soothing supply for the already established 2 years.
Soldiers of the rapid-deployment brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns anymore, so shooting exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted because of.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't even know why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need them for.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as dealers, would most like to meet," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, STV Group's sales manager.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cord with the fact that the army had covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison, the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume even before the expiration of the period of use.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords remains open.
The Ministry of Defense has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who appealed to MF DNES, the Czech Armed Forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have so "favorably" purchased today.
To this day, I have found the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition last year.
The story of his success is as bold as a film scenario.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware of the lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he acquired a construction house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire profit in the house, which he then converted step by step to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already signed up," says Entrepreneur Number One from last year.
"A large share of this license sale to operate hotels was just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You also don’t have to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that he would not have come to otherwise.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
The fame associated with the success, in his opinion, also settles a little on each of its employees.
And here he is at seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I don’t really see this as just a personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is only a little in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone company of the year last year was received by Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to stamp a company out of the ground from the small tool factory in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against the competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> as compensation for the property seized by the Communists for lease a small workshop, he did not hesitate for a long time, left his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and founded his own company with a few comrades of his father's company.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that she also came to the awareness of the non-professional public.
“Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also started to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, adding greater value,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, last year at Farmet was not only in the sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which at the time shook citizens even less, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we could not avoid this situation.”
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>
A viable company sometimes also has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
For one, the company was unwilling to make cuts - in terms of investments in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All of this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with unreasonable regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some unreasonable rules have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested an extract from the trade register, even though the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the future when checking social security payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the nonsense.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German newspaper Wirtschaftszeitung (HN), which enjoys growing popularity among the public.
Last year, when the three thousand people took part in the vote, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder the company’s activity.
"As far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, for example, we are at the forefront of the world," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business activities has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of terms and conditions, down eight places from the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was held for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz is used. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It conquers the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and regulations have already been applied for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are also provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways have to pay a toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on the Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, competed with the Party at the height of the competition.
"Where the state throws the businessmen a lump between their legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year that still make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to do business today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create senseless arrangements out of the world are effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to have to notify the commercial officer at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was abolished by a Novelle of the Commercial Act.
The duty that received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Labour Office service travel of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card" law.
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the talking room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, who is the guarantor of this competition, as well as the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal have signed up.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their work, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady is also taking good care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which they were awarded the title "Responsible company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, they ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a working time that was reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment,” explains Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>, its managing director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region, in turn, is concerned with the health of its employees and has therefore procured ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition to promoting homework for its employees and using cartering services that are protected by a home-based factory.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlsbad region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, increase their qualifications and vacation," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the Responsible Company of the Year category, all district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police at a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
In doing so, the local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was abducted by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate an ongoing public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraudulent activities in a public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo", she could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated on the basis of sparse official information.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the ground fund, referred to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s question in this regard, that the police actually made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not about one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition had the correct name "Call for tender for claims for the transfer of land under the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants indicated an interest in the offered land.
"These persons shall, in the context of the invitation, offer a higher value of their refundable claims by way of the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, and then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokeswoman.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was obviously available information on who had signed up for the invitation and, since he himself was a entitled person, having purchased a number of refund claims, he offered a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Clearly against a fat rebound.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has had very good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the ground fund V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds, for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also acquired from the Land Fund land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access highways to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house right in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give in to the heavy heart, in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, as well as higher rents for district heating and in some places.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more from their wallets each month than ever before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2% and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also the district heating supplies will be expensive.
The cost of electricity alone costs the households a few hundred crowns more per year.
The high electricity prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, so it is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Gas becomes only moderately more expensive, but this is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too we can expect a few hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger cities in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové have to pay up to 50 kroner more per month for district heating from January, more than 1000 kroner more per year pay families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9% higher water and wastewater charges, in case the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4%.
Huge increases in rental prices are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will disappear from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to interest them in court.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 homes, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need to be treated for emergency.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep out their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the head of the children's department at the Central Bohemian Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Clinic.
"Whisky, if it manages to get the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell that strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Faculty Hospital Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> is right.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about Slibovitz, which you take with you from home," said Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers in hospital are no exception.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Her career began at the age of 12, when she was first introduced to the blood with 3.5 promille of alcohol and in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief physician wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when bumping with their own sprouts that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependency in the true sense of the word is not about children.
“Under alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood, and this is not the case in these children.”
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Ms. Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required a hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or possibly by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of schnaps in the school bench, in the opinion of Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, there are three seasonal amplitudes, on which one hundred percent reliance: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief over the bad testimony or out of joy on vacation."
"On Walpurgis night, I have also experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to deal with an unpleasant caterpillar the next day.
The headaches in the morning after, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes spoiling the patient’s good mood by listing the cost of treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
“Once again, I used this as a means of education when I pre-calculated directly to the children at the visit, which cost their intoxication and that it can quite happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party,” Dr. Pelikan added.
In his opinion, however, the health funds do not resort to regressive procedures to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
They have so far only been seen abroad during maneuvers or flight shows.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are currently preserved in Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
When she physically dispatches the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter jets, in turn, were excluded from long-term storage aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The two-seat L-159T1s have been replaced in their current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, as the Defense Ministry signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four superfluous L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second wants it to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to putting the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek approved the exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice because it would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not participate in it by responding to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last of which is expected to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is due to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men up to sixty," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty as much as 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the study was fleetingly known to him, yet he did not yet consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be “fully proven”.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways there is mostly heavy snow, the winter servicemen were on the axis in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This was said by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided here as well.
Drivers should leave just behind Brno at kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and at kilometer 182 take up to the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are kilometers of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11, which happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow blanket several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the district of Prosek, also the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow cover.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 am until 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snowstorms and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snowblowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here too, you will have to use snowblowers for snow removal.
When they will be available again, can not be estimated until now.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution is advised in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which, for reasons of nature conservation, can only be sprinkled with inert spreading agents, there is a snow blanket up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, snow is slowly falling.
U.S. soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
U.S. troops have deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are guided to the target by a laser with a hit safety of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber shells designed for this rifle, which contain high explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only in the impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
From above, he is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put him out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of “intelligent” technologies.
"The soldier basically acts like this: he visualizes the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise point of view, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just needs to push back.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"If you press down, the gun charges and shoots the bullet down to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the group, which have so far been distributed to the region, should be accommodated there.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large office space in Astro Park would be better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt’s Markus Frank (CDU) said it would win a “global player” once again.
This is a “great confession of location.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed of the intention by the management at an early stage.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have led to the rash.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Town Hall Square and the adjacent "Little Verticals" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas used previously as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, acquired the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konus is the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has a lot more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped ground plan - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics industry has its headquarters.
Amazon shuts down servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Possibly there is political pressure behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic messages.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
Wikileaks’ disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former US server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s roster, is reportedly in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free," the revelation activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had relied on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic mailings to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
In a tweet, WikiLeaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees engaged in investigations, CNN reported citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“I wish Amazon had taken this action sooner in light of the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from being used on servers in other countries as well.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless actions jeopardize our national security and endanger lives around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on Interpol’s arrest list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location being Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There was even a call for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper – apparently ironic – said on television that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
In the meantime, a blow exchange broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The U.S. government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
The White House said it had appointed Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, as its special envoy.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of the message reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active should they be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
“We have done everything possible to get in touch with them,” Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary."
The Ice-University
At the Gelato University near Bologna, ice conduits are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelati<0xC3><0xA8>re and from the Gelataio.
The gelator, in German a bit old-fashioned the ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, removes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you will not come by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The University of Ice Cream has set up the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines will meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to put something of her own in a nerve-wracking job after years.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano cuts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns on a rooster at the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own desire for experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice cubes.
Certain variations on the basic mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the candy store.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you into dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or the ice cream from the white base, which turns into a yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, moccasin and hazelnut ice cream – with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavors, more fruit puree - tasty, that's not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra serving of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzer thus measures the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computation easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is creamy and cooled to minus temperatures at the same time.
In spite of all automation, small breaks do not stop.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates cover themselves from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized rod mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Checkers in the Spotlight
The European Food Authority (EFSA) has been migrated from the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi Lobbyists Association for years.
It is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing regulations for genetically modified plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The EFSA rules are, in a word, identical to Ilsi's position papers, thus misleading the industry's handwriting, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has called for a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking EFSA manager was recently without conditions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed sides.
The Central German Broadcasting (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians have made clear.
However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
All reliable data, including those from industry, are used as long as they are of high technical quality, a statement said.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This is a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without every feeding attempt and the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does on the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you find them?” he asked.
Angelika Hilbeck thinks so too.
The researcher has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the US, and in Europe as well.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
“The industry is controlling security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell also took care of some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night he stood in front of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had moved and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar deepening of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in debris.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the broccoli.
"These stones are relics."
"They can't disappear."
He boasts: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the broccoli, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought everyone who was affected by the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden shed that was once a watchtower.
He was insulted and threatened, he told the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to be continued.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took with them one of the quads weighing on average 80 kilograms, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what trunks and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the impulse have long been transformed into "walls" or limitations of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“It wasn’t the political component.”
He climbs in his off-road car, taking a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
Jura he studied and discontinued, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany he collects his treasures.
He says he is the Republic’s largest stone dealer.
It's slowing down.
In the snow lie artfully covered sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful Travertine."
The squadrons once belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if something like that were to be scrapped.”
He has not become rich, nor has he become stone-rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and also a stonemason, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the woods.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the recycler.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to be saved.
Talent Fight a High-Potentials
There's a lot of excitement at the buffet.
16 students push themselves for salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition for ideas, they are supposed to compete with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now in close contact and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they enter the labor market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish essays on the achievements of their students, one tries to find out the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to one another.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group promotes the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber beads and folders with a VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them the way in the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
It’s important to note that the students are so offensive.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants.
Instead, they have to price themselves and, in particular, they have to rely on highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern carving hunt in which participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate, decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are hounded and stung, according to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was not enough for us."
For the talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be going up.
"To date, we have been in contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
“Some are close to graduation and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct buzz on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the Pirsch quite classically at professional trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“For example, at the Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, HR Manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the youth problem.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not advertised by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large corporation can’t often offer that,” says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual best list of German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also give job seekers a boost.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He encourages his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within one’s own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would promote their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like a game with gangs,” says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington – and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
Further drilling on the Atlantic coast is still prohibited.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not been definitively clarified to this day.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions in demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the post-explosion drilling stop.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been accused of numerous corruption allegations, is undergoing fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now publicly warning that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," according to a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it well.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following an attempt to light up a boy waving to the chest in the water with the snouts surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil deposits float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here in buckets, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured out from a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: The Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-hit regions in the world.
While driving through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat swells brown broth, who puts his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black liquorice rods from the ground, sadly leaving occasional palms to be found hanging their wedges.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are chosen in vain: as soon as the outboard is silent, spooky tranquility spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darker: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here organized in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became oil for its work.
Even today, the company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland have broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames stand out like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year, the amount of oil as it pushed into the sea ahead of Alaska in the crash of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago – one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU, is disputed.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see shattering drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
In 2008, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company of “only the rate of defects in the pipelines is many times higher than anywhere else”.
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, the mangrove shapes emerge: they are split-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, partly connected with pipes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire flares up: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catch pot, later, at the end of the line, kerosene and finally diesel drips out.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres per day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are exploiting the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still underestimate the ridiculously low price of diesel at almost 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is being processed illegally: organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tankers and spoil it on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental disaster is more due to the displacement of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen’s livelihoods, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was so shattered that only a deduction from the group would be in question: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are better off.”
Michael is getting nervous.
“It’s high time you disappeared,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, there is no threat of arrest, but a painful grease.
Like all Nigerians, soldiers mainly from the north of the country also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators Detect Dangerous Construction Defects in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a serious safety issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault in the investigation of an emergency-landed machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently much more fortunate than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose connection could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce-produced engines in 20 A380-series aircraft were affected.
This includes the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a plea before an Australian federal court in Sydney that would allow him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had dissolved and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines worldwide have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
In the case of an A380, Lufthansa replaced the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: At night, almost all over the country, snow has fallen.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is frosty in Germany: at icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic is snowing on Thursday night – leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeter thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but the constantly rising snow was not finished.
In addition, fierce bends swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snowfall on highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to Meteomedia, the alert level was therefore violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
In part, there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic jams and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turns are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with blankets, food and drinks in the train by firefighters and rescuers.
Snowstorms were sweeping over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, several cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, almost 400 field beds are still available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a track crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after hitting a smooth road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
The good news, however, is that the snow is still going to be loose and powdery, which is why it will swirl up in light bends.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is afflicted by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Money House is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could contribute to the property.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; now the bankers were allowed back to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes citing a spokesman.
The reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the spokesperson.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate yourself and then rent it back,” he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution relinquishes its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had not taken over the double towers until mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently extensively rehabilitated them.
The energy conversion swallowed the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" according to the newspaper at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the lost miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be recovered, because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were dumped under days.
A probe had been dropped into the cage of misfortune, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the comrades.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends commemorated the dead with a commemoration.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the radiant sunshine of Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
For two minutes they were silent.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the comrades could be seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags blew to half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would "come back to the surface from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemoration participants.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been dumped.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the fiery temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-evaluates old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) gently liberates himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman powers, turns his opponents around in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to get rid of the rabid method of painting.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says no word about the whole film, and the other characters can be dragged into one or two sentences or a few agonizing death cries at most.
Otherwise, it is silenced and swayed in the creepy beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a movie has multiple audiences, only if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the surrounding brain mass and guts.
Action fans will die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, one eye breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and for an eternity stuck in flute and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film-turned fever dream.
There is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly closes his throat, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, one-eyed faithful to the side, preserves such a thing as innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, perhaps the messenger of the devil himself.
It means ruin, perhaps only for the anyway ruined.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and amaze.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released new information about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position - it still allows controls.
By midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets were attacking a mysterious dice-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quadrangle hidden in a valley running from the river.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby El-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium, from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA made a video presentation with blurred satellite imagery.
Through computer animation, she identified which components of the reactor were supposed to have been destroyed, which was a small copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was standing just before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than then, yes the puzzles became bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even if they consider the CIA presentation “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he is to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat last summer replied only lapidarly that the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
The debris of the alleged "unused military building" was hastily removed by the Syrians and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time right after the attack via a member state, which may be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as has the satellite imagery.
In addition, it prohibits the inspectors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 drags on without results and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-blocking treaty in the space.
As a key to progress in the enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and other than this still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants are involved, what function they have, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the South German newspaper, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely on this grounds, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the quadrangle on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three sites.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus has also scrapped this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter does not have a high urgency, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Control Authority has to pass.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this direction: firstly, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat puts it, "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some planned filming days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's Victims of War organization wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There had been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, Jolie has been sacked as an ambassador, the Guardian reported.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, after some hindsight granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film on the net is created, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is transported to a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
Which sounds significantly different from the variant "rape victims get fucked up in torture slave".
That Jolie’s film actually begins before the war – that much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now all you can do is bring peace to Hollywood’s hackers: by illegally putting the script online, as so many have done before.
Nothing like away here
This evening, it’s finally going well for the Irish.
No sign of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer for joy with screaming loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Cork is shaking as players throw table tennis balls into beer mugs over a three-metre distance – and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros winning prize plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a murky feeling about it,” he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be an emigration wave comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now once again spreading.
The economic crisis is especially worrying for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has only gone uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was plenty of money.
Three out of every ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of readers' letters of young immigrants complaining: "Everything in Ireland goes down the drain."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future unfold because the government is only doing eye-witness work and no longer offering young people prospects for the future.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates hang from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to make a positive impression on the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
“For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gala service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known how it feels to build something elsewhere for half a year.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently building a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home, as he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never in."
He laughs a little and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 four years ago - 100% credit financed.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The construction engineer does not like the whining that he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to be hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe that makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just watch how it goes with life elsewhere.
After all, he has a few years of work in London and why in New Zealand should it not be so good for him and his girlfriend?
But one thing still bothers him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could end up in a farewell party.
“Don’t get too emotional,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a walk-away party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democracies Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
This was the result of the Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of proponents of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since the strong collapse last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust their country’s Congress and 45% trust their government, both of which are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crisis undermined its efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, perhaps due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are significant differences in mood from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support to the private and market economies: around 71% of respondents said that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A voter's slap
No one had expected the November 28 elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the sacked country.
Overcrowded polling booths, multiple votes cast, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations, and intimidation were only part of the problems.
The polling stations were opened with a delay of several hours.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around looking for an option.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, called for the cancellation of the election results because of an alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "very good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement from observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, no matter how serious they may be, do not necessarily render the process invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The Electoral Authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected general election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval among voters, declares the election authority the winner of the general election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election had not yet been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you in a re-election next year depends on whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife’s election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further shattering.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others targeted the government for bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - push the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty alleviation to be his main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then fine-tuned the official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez take a more moderate path now?
She has called the private sector and trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step towards cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely fed up with clergy.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to them will be waned.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to cancel many of her husband’s political decisions quietly.
Weak Applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, went to vote for mayors and city councilors in the five city districts. This is assessed as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only a short one.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater Taiwanese independence, received nearly 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual occurrences in Taiwan occurred, such as truck convoys with crane makers, flag-swinging mass movements and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man shot him in the face from the crowd. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarreweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also avoided aggravating the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the working people and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it too is able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai plans to forge ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet and the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan favours a rapprochement only limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no going back.”
Grammy Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding Surprisingly Awarded Newcomer of the Year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist before the release of the album, with which he has been presented to the general public three albums, highest
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her bewitched voice and a good sense of pop, radio and Latin music, Spalding can be easily compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics thus experienced a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robberies favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, in which more likely to be found albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group, so he competes against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathschenways" is a good example of a band's democracy.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award feature a colourful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices, are listed.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists have been nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Chockner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Verquium Vocals; "Different" by Cacrini;
In the opera category were Bergs "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hass "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and the choir "The Art Wanderer" from the National Orchestra and the Sulhur Marisky.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often hot public hearing, was unanimously agreed by the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
“As an American, I’m proud of that.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“There are only a few opponents,” he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one commenter said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is said to have two minarets and to be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is, in their opinion, a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered life-necessary.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it very special, although it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ life form,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of Science magazine on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even more when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, she assumed that microbes that are exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behavior to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, adapting and growing.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
“There is reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth age,” said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office statement on Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is, the dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information about the dogs' whereabouts or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigations are still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's wage, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially sealed off the “prepared” credit plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to pave the way for new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is leading the company. The financing is expected to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to resolve MGM’s financial worries and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
In addition, they plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies resulted in no results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can rip a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realised that Moore’s Law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is found on a wider range.
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, that sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of send and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games such as 'Simon Says', and thanks to its novel hinge feet with wheel locking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better knowledge with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter image after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90 for kids ages 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8 and older). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller shoes or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids 5+) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an erroneous garden of cubes.
And he endures a lot.

Police interventions in China are becoming smoother
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s rugged guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence – to impress viewers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Look straight!"
“Show them,” he whispered to them, “how pretty girls are!”
Four girls, barely growing up in their teenage years, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarked in a slight way.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green ones.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with low-starvation: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly surrounded an improperly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been intensifying the city’s police stripes. They have been selected special because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the coarsely beaten police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws with fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them using his mobile phone, beating down a protest action against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a hand mix with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough clean-up.”
Skeptics see the current approach as clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October by advertisement, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both of them.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonic facial features" were sought.
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends upon reaching the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity is too physically strenuous for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not wish to add to this description,
However, he admitted that size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this should be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use hams or buckligens here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple berries and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the trenches, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they had more ambitious career plans than simply shoveling traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants’ goods, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ransacked after the rumor escalated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chengguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
However, unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, which was repaired contrary to the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers, with grim faces, made their way to their vehicles and proceeded with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, stayed behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"But sometimes also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start arguing.”
U.S. Attorney Will Not Indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges raised against him following his affair with a former electoral aide and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbied activity, the senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal indictment against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal, which made headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been suspended and that no further charges had been filed in the matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said they felt there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, helped to lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during the Ensigns campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was still on Ensign’s election team recently, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had been close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on turn-door lobbying.
According to the published indications, “it appears to be a compromise and a violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethics advocates said the ministry seemed to be very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest in Steve's case, including last year's decision to sue Mr. T. Sessler.
Prosecutors “are obviously horrific,” said Melanie Sloan, the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles, a group of lawyers who have filed various charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
“In principle, this means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day, in which he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had put before the prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and myself, but let's just say that we think we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, after which a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail dated December 2008 confirms that, after the company forwarded Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Department of the Interior for a case.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
When information about this affair first came to the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologised to his constituents and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After many months of noticing, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the Justice Department’s example very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
A half-dozen of them got away in the courtroom clashes.
At the minute, they sent their reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed-chained children trial in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge’s verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications with the court, setting out the grounds for appeal and which the courts will be busy with for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and a widespread, immediate penetration of disturbing details, so that the jury has been inadmissible to the public.
This objection could lead the appellate courts to consider whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the incorporation of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief advocate.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, rejected the applications by ruling last week briefly and vehemently when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court objections have found that reporting famously infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his ruling that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections, which Mr. Haye’s conviction half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the out-of-court communication pathways that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her nanny, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with abhorrence.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he would have inadmissibly put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weeks.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process perhaps attracts the greatest interest.
In a ruling they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media would have continuously ignited the flames of emotion over the case.
“Such a day-to-day crowd of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “hasn’t been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more important than reports that are returned more slowly is a tech-opposing view that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that courts of appeal would often face the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this allegation.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was overturned on account of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of slander and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called “lame duck session” at the end of a government term in which decisions are no longer being made.
According to all that is heard, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observance of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collection.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one calls for the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington has been a mild one, at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one favors that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the rise in unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying unemployment workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that these issues can be agreed during the "lame duck session" and at the same time the New START Treaty can be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012, as a foreplay, or shadowboxing, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the emergence of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
As worried as Republican leaders may be that they are playing poker too high, they know that they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and overturn health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own estimation, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes in the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes if the Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and the health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more consequential election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
U.S. document leaked portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes part of the bribery and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the American embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy — what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “verticals of authority” — takes its share of the money that heads up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he had been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked for documentation suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct association of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it ‘disrupted’ and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government,” the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, literally meaning 'roof' or protection) that extends across the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as throughout the entire Moscow government.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top spot."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are at the second level."
"Recently, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer in demand as before.”
The memo notes that while fundraising is extensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don’t pay find their business closed very quickly – due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, said in an interview recently.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from “the least corrupt” to “the most corrupt”).
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will certainly trigger mishaps within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow’s mistakes, there may also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are being solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a dimly lit, accentuated classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as the "Battleman", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, longtime supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a UN-Cambodian community tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments grew fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindering their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from illness, overhaul or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to flock to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The court’s mandate is to convict the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute any further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district head of Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told an officer at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation with the Khmer era means bringing together the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education’s High School, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and soiled with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot’s body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas – hoping he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapon-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).”
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms, which is fundamentally weaponized, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone.”
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting a deal.
The first attempt to remove Uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Risk Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimates that this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects documents leaked by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s (by cable) and it is added that former Deputy Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega asked the Spanish government to be informed to be over-watched to prove that the Spanish government is flying from Spain.
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid to human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in the distance" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“You just want to be informed so you don’t get “unprepared for surprises,” Aguirre said via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any information that is offensive or sensitive," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the “apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors” than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly manage between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely keen on their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he has given instructions to his staff to flaunt the comments, "to flaunt the
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a note that the government of Zapatero will be tolerating or intentionally ignoring U.S. actions that could be construed as potential human rights violations, even if those disclosures are negatively impacting the U.S. government,” he said.
The child murderer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "difficulty" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand this, one needs to know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs based on testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with industrialist Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she broke up, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be inferred that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
“When I told him this, he was fine, but now he naturally realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave whatever he wants.”
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the boy to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she says of returning to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a questionable intention when you consider their bad relationship.
There will be another email in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me such a piece of shit."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the Prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (Überschrift)".
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting overseer, declares to have bites of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice on Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
The duty defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the course of the situation, "and she had no intention of inflicting harm on the little one."
However, she had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its view on the parliamentary elections - whether or not it is preferable. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of redirecting the PSC's share of the vote and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional deputies, while CiU would also gain four (it has now 10) and the PSC would gain at least 9 seats.
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could keep its MPs or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011 will fall. Even then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to the socialist dominance, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the City Council of Barcelona in 2011: one of the largest of the 6 million households in the city.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Municipal Council of Barcelona, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's upheaval, where they had ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 Catalan city administrations and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of Pt<0xC4><0x81>t<0xC4><0x81>t<0xC4><0x81>t<0xC4><0x81>.
The Spanish interior minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which go so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been "weakened" worldwide and "sometimes their ability to act".
The researchers estimate that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they could be forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could be sent unpunished across the borders of European and other western countries.
The cell uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that similar attacks will be carried out in the EU in the coming days as the one that was carried out in Barcelona last day.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another operation was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhammad Butyah and Kihanmad Athar Butt were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years old and still had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative circles point out that so far no connection between the detainees in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay has been established, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the groups of recipients of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "Commandos", which ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a large amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas’ conditions to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of regional economic recovery, the regional recovery and the lack of regional economic recovery.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the certainty that she was given the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party at the CiU party's polling station is at least dependent on the fact that
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As for the PPC party chairman, she calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - to be submitted to the head of the CiU even to a referendum in support of the accession.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to streamline the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat will discuss the details of the negotiations for the appointment of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the nursing home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they showed the damage done to the institution by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who killed at least eleven elderly people, for whom he was responsible during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only suffer a loss of social standing, because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat roundly denied this point, stating that "remaining measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the litigation there was no evidence of negligence by any person other than the accused.”
He confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to relieve patients of their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done according to confession in three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the nurse’s statements, not even the number of reported murders, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and the euro has hardly added points, which is cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debts, as these are ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, with only one week of indefinite access being maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and give a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back, and if we insist that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying government debt and the markets would collapse thereafter, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State wealth management spent only $500 million at 5.28%, compared to $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a shift in perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not realizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the treasury effect, which is why we are betting on a strong demand that will eliminate any doubts about our ability to re-indebt.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without a deadline.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only the being, but also the appearance counts."
Courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Oulen contests the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Oulen and El Enebro, does not waver.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company group, will contest the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to get a majority in order to control the company's governing bodies - owner of the winery Bodegagas.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not appear to be willing to give up control of El Enebro’s institutions in his litigation.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The appeal of the judge for the summons to the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to officially declare, through legal cunning, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse, the Assembly of January 18 as a null and void.
This argument is the basis for challenging the assembly retrospectively in order to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who shrouded themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting on a judicial path.
At El Enebro - the property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
That is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the appeal, for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are upgraded with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes in this exquisite universe.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep rise during the last season, at the end of the race last November, everyone was betting on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected at the races and during the tests.
Russwurm reports that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racetracks, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, who use high-performance computer systems to perform analyses and make any changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits – especially by journalists – are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the racetracks, are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose fame is zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago it was still possible to say that the R&D advances for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed: technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchise system and stressed that with the exclusive sales outlet network, "customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after that, even the packaging will be optimized."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"This way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days in ten minutes."
“This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from its rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers and believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a collapse in interest rates that banks are trying to balance with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public aid from FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank faces will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all the banks’ plans.
This year, Sabadell will finalize its four-year Optima roadmap, which was initially designed for three years, but was extended by one fiscal year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain will only "slowly" emerge from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities – which penalizes the interest margins – will fade away, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity issues are already rolled over to the price of loans as compensation for declining profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the faucet off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase the interest rate differentials (see Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "raising fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s roadmap is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently "enormously rising" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that FROB can replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After reassuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he disproves the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be circulated, but unlike the events of June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis can be caught.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of the savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not want to participate in the first phase, and they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was adjustments."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrita stated that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process, which was established in the past, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average asset stock of 28 billion to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have met the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of unbridled opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed inseriousness and nonsense" because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to conclude in due course before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, adding that those who doubted this "without deeper knowledge" would do so.
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we "don't have to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have gone through a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the cancellation of the 426 euros of support for unemployed people who receive no unemployment benefits, up to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports of Elba, and the administration of the 30 states of Barajas.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her publicity work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which clashes with the preservation of the traditions of a large part of its partners.
In the face of resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German mark - although that currently sounds more like science fiction - , supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third: A reshaping of the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the standards; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been taking off for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of a discrepancy between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country back when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country, while also obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it propelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been accepted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which is to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it did not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the opposing countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard path of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as it was cited by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do badly if we didn't understand.
It is not just about reducing the state deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will move into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of order in her own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like that would change anything.
Among the options considered is that we should not rule out the euro area, which is full of low-reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sports and bypass rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being poured on whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the emerging debate about the case depicted goes back to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who pretends to be noble and honor in his anthem and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role in this, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who has procured an episode more to his longer history than the technique theat
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention of the rules, in fact, this practice adheres to the statutes of the sport, but seems to circumvent its purpose.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players taking an unjustified advantage from the opposing team, and that didn’t happen either.
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid’s players is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by misconduct or circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders derive from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not put in a more disadvantageous position nor were advantages accrued for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to some extent unknown advantage, as the team could eventually exit as well, as players receive a penalty with this procedure and move on to the second card cycle, where they exit with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent the sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusion and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The harm inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona, Spain
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widespread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which supply oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to catch up with the customer segment, which represents the large crowd.
In order to make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar has dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s, Chairman of the Barcelona Board of Restaurants.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict until now what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it a dozen times before they book.”
“They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices by 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants found that the evening of December 17th led to the collapse of the providers.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adjusted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advanced reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, optimism is not lost after the second quarter the revenues are thriving again and good prospects for the Christmas business are faced, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again, which gives the impression that the groupnesses are again on the upswing.
From the side of the Dachverband Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "suggest a maximum".
However, the fun of the celebration did not go down, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concerns in the United States
“Islamabad is making nuclear weapons faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks website, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not intensifying but, on the contrary, is "decreasing" other countries, and that the unstable Asian country is becoming more and more nuclear.
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepares Washington for sleepless nights.
In a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered by the United States alone, but also by Russia, as an outlier and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to hire highly-reliable personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation unveiled by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is slowing down and the increased pace at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office that described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to offers of assistance or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official with the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify to the person responsible that Pakistan’s army has to cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorism official to prevent further revelations.
Interpol has issued a red alert to the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything connected to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "find and prosecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of more than four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but rather with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens’ lawyer said: “The police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and invent Assange, "to arrest and provisionally extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, according to the organization, many member states consider the red alert as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where the case is where
The move infuriated Assange’s lawyers, who released a letter yesterday informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and is being compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia claims her son's innocence - Assange stops at an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time magazine a Skype interview from an undetermined location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thereby violate international agreements signed against the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should pay attention to a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are announcing these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or contributes.”
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange had to be “murdered.”
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is one too mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s looks for peace in the ERC with a wink
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of full assembly.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the twentieth time of an internal upheaval in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the electorate’s directionless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close relatives of former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former leaders.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could speak secretly about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with raised hands.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty note from the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod supporters demand more from the president than just the party to make his office available, an insufficient gesture as Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the highest organ of Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will submit to the Council for a vote on 18th.
Their intention is to bail out Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, who, in turn, is to promise to present Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The chairman of the ERC party believes that polyphony harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that Acting Counsellor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologue, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party chairman would be supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of full assembly as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes that would allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' team, which has already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed with the end of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 Assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of full assembly at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle of the internal truce of recent years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors at bay, the time may have come to take up this matter again and finalize it forever.
23 killed in November, 290 killed in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, Mexico recorded four fewer cases than in 2010.

Among those killed are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, a total of 390 deaths are believed to be related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a place in Toluca.

In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news, was probably left by his murderers next to him.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with gunshot wounds was found in her neck.
On the skin of the woman were discovered tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding pictures.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the settlement of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.

The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and locked in black plastic bags, next to which was a message; the second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year that includes the targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he argued, several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was introduced over the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s scientific advisor to the government on climate change, confirmed that China’s efforts would be far greater than commonly thought.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent overall contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use: energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years, and another one is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former chairman of the Panist Party has the right to turn to the National Commission for Order and demand what the right grants him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion was right-wing Manuel Espino Barrientos and that the former party chairman of the PAN has the right to turn to the National Commission for Order and demand what the right allows him.
In an interview conducted prior to the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos, as governor of the state, said Espino’s exclusion was a decision that had been taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Ordinance Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right, in his case, to address the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional (Commission of the Order of the National Council) in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to run for president had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal elections, it was successful and it fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt select the best chairperson or chairperson needed for the next three years, so he would hand over the relays "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open, and I would be proud to delegate the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last July 4 elections would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and would be observed throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is up to the requirements."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the holder of the federal government could make expressions like those in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban and even less censorship.
Obama's Twitter campaign for law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of enacting the Dream Act, call your senators and push for enacting this bill,” the president tweeted on social media.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act - a law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for passing this bill,” Obama tweeted.
His briefing includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that urges the public to submissively contact their senators as the vote on the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, it’s time to listen to you,” he said.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except the expansion of the tax cuts from the Bush era and the funding of the government would be expanded.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the approval of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blocking of Republicans from the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects can be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must have been settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law that would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students from next Thursday in the Senate, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years living in that country and enrolled in a higher education institution or in the military.
But the proponents of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the bill.
That’s why the advocates of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out for the bill, John McCain, has yet to determine his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest hurdles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Delight in Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that explained the Spanish-language literature and at this occasion she was the subject of a sexual conversation.
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer spitting sweetly towards the audience, which consisted mainly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table of Montez<0xC3><0xAD>n, which was moderated by Marisol Shultz.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then characterized Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not mention the answer, but notes for her
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented an enchanting narrative, which he called 'Praise of the Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back widely traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and recounted about America, the great novel, which he criticized from the beginning was not lacking in the overflow of his own chroniclers of the D<0xC3><0xAD>itillo, and about
“Cervantes, who invited us all, mocked the preconceived witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told – with imaginative power that even lost its sense of shame.”
However, he points out that "it is the crazies and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the "Tradition of Cervantes."
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the round table ‘Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence inflicted on her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the fights for the drug trade.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned commitment,” she explained, after she had emphasized that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as if in a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also raised "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, too, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness flow out of dogmatisms, and is forgotten that "behind every confirmation stands a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality again, we need to nuance: and to nuance often means to put the finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they share in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, to think and also to serve the senses in the world of black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different styles are also facing each other, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has won the medal to become the second champion, he has been one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached his first final as a coach at the Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleventh meter he came 3-1 forward and got two chances to get his game in.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one against Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be haunted by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, that I'm going to surrender, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens first is the most important thing," he said.
The last final game is still strong in his memory, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also, because the last time we were ready to play with Elf, because the last time we were on the
Knowing that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting does not bother him, because he will not be familiar to his players: "You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish this in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for that, in the previous tour we were poorly prepared for the game, but unfortunately, to be prepared for the last one, we were poorly prepared in the end of the game, but unfortunately, we were ready for the end of the game.
It’s in Romanso’s power to no longer be just a second champion and to savour for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation with the consulate at the services for the visa application; costs will be waiting times will be shortened thus.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASCs, the initial letters in English) prior to their conversation at the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, as it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the opposite of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only need to introduce themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for life in space.
The U.S. National Aerospace Administration (NASA) today announced an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable, and it was hypothesized that they could transform into intelligent living beings — like humans — if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource, and taking this ability into account, the chances of life on other planets that do not have our protective atmospheres may increase.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, "there is actually another life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference, the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress, the bipartisan system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, had already established itself as an independent. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Prior to the start of the introductory session in the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as this would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a “two-party system” would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency, led by Panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that with these reforms, the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginal position.
He said that in the next few days, they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, going out of their political will and if they did not, they would be back from both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point I [the opposition coalition], that's what I see, because we're excluded from all decisions that don't even consider taking into account the opinions of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence stated that there would be similarities with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that the Congress, after it was monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
“For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more,” the Convergence member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT argued in reference to PAN and PRI that the Congress has currently turned into a 'plunder' for two.
"Before there was only one party, now divide them in two."
Mr Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked Members to be respected and to be given a seat at the negotiating table.
It is not the case that, in the light of the decisions taken by the top five, which are likely to be nine MEPs, the five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table.
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Administration pays another cheque to the disputed owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque, issued in the amount of 200.144.56 pesos, with the number 9258447, was issued on November 16 for the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already said that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is watched by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and consequently the number of checks that are still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like with the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year "again": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25 the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of the mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez the municipality had counted over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada trade association, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and turn the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and walkways had a negative impact as tourists came to stroll and saw the mess, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a business one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work that way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the tourist’s fall would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How should it do this? Now, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in the aftermath," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unmaintained and unfinished," he said, "for example, the Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in check," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents represent only what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s tourist sites because they would not be used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought together with the city on Vordermann.To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
“Happily, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that would have to be cleaned and cleaned first to make them attractive for tourism and to add them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s corporate sector is calling for a dignified parliament, free of agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
"We hope that MPs will really exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival comrades of the ruling parties and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to allocate the necessary importance in the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings currencies and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next Tri-King's Day, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes hard times are set because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon, I go with the gourds to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s proposes Cayetana clothes in the size for a year.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I said to him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Elf-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe has size 12; ten-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as has size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the demolition of a cannabis production and sales network, the ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region were carried out.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
House searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have served primarily in the manufacture of drugs.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of the men who are considered to be the main perpetrators of the drug ring were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could, among other things, be charged with the production of cannabis, its possession for sale purposes, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that lasted for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien regional investigation unit of the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police department and the Memphremagog police authority had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be easily traced
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says will regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stamped out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
“I stand with a party that has put chains on your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seagoing vessel for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill because it was against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
Criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has shook the hand of critics demanding her party not behaving steadfastly enough toward the secret immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures are being taken against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to enforce by mediating another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and holds children captive for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians strongly advise MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a foot deputies.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Minister Kenney's response said.
“The government has not announced any confidence vote regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest’s announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, the Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, also qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" as well as "a solution rightly arranged at a table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had addressed those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (state university for the training of senior administrative officials).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes to Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he decided.
He is also of the opinion that Quebec could grant the same powers of scrutiny as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the cabinets of the Charest government.
Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal law to better deal with this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties related to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enacted the law against gangsterism.
Strictly monitored rivers
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has spilled into some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preemptively evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has collapsed into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have spilled over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters more precipitation were expected here by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had descended here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is still to be added to these precipitations, there is a fear of crossing several watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec security service about the flood alert regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentinian Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re become the subject of flood surveillance and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has resulted in the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a evacuation bridge was demolished due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State High Water Centre issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, notably from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec Broadcasting Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial remarks on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his out-of-date speeches via radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that, while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements have "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustifiably negative representations of Haitians, as well as such unspoken speeches that are not included in the day's broadcast."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint lodged by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activists’ organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide solid and misleading information.
Regarding the issue of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that the suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the affected consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any offense against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements made in connection with the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective discussion in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated in favor of Haitian aid, as it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of Haitians.
“I have already dropped my three-day suspended sentence in this case.”
“My file has been a virgin for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all the decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unspoiled form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, should have communicated its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally look for the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight, like the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the security officer of his sign, who worked for UPS, had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championships held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
“I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"It was those fighters from every category who had placed in the top four at the last World Cup."
"I got babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005, I was behind in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
“It’s worth mentioning that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which fist strikes and footsteps are allowed as well as floor throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," the sympathetic pounder said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before then losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their heads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to hand over this important, $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and de-empowers the competition."
"This means that instead of playing games in a secret way, they are now being played in an open form," Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, told a news conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, reacted this afternoon by vehemently stating that the contract was a card game.
"I remain true to my line," she said, adding that the PQ had acted "unreasonably" and "missing her hardness."
She said it was “the least” that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise with respect to a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competitive battle being possible; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec business register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of more lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Real Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has left the nose about the fact that the contract for project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a call and there are only a few applicants, your prices will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts that were approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti liberal du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had alleged that PQ was equally linked to the companies that “financed them” before specifying that they were rather their leaders.
Barometer Accountability Consumption - The "Green" Label Is Not Trustworthy
Greener, but skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but equally little confidence in the labels or eco-labels that are meant to control his choice.
Too bad, even though it bathes in a media-effective universe where it is so full of information in favor of a more responsible consumer: the barometer responsible consumer has a lack of credible information to complain about, an insufficiency that has become known as the brake of its commitment.
Although they pushed the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to charge those trying to sell them little credit.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that they have as little faith in companies’ environmental commitment as they have in green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer center at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being revived by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and the dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the stated efficiency of green products and services that are being sought to be put at their fingertips.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to the barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible – the Eco-conscious Consumption Index had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – the Homo Consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprints left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride-hailing centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked by Société Angus and the company Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallele, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, apparently did not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Rather, instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could bring about a viable solution under favorable conditions, at least according to sources from government rumors.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected downwards since the once again summarily.
A proposal along with an action plan have already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
A few days ago, he gave her a final report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed to the side.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinema owners and cinema complexes had objected to a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he did not allow to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for more than ten years, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulties, which could justify the exception on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients at bay.
Société Angus and the company Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are running a privately funded campaign, which they hope will be worth $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not take down the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new U.S. diplomatic lines circulated by WikiLeaks were revealing the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but with the same stroke they are revealing the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind in the run-up to the election, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were released to the public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content one has to gnaw at.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A quasi-intrinsic inferiority complex conditioned by Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to attribute the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the Free Trade Campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of."
The ambassador understands this "ear-sucking silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he evaluates, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind at the ballot box as a key factor.”
The other expression of this feeling of importance is in the message sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, a managing director in Ottawa, which President Barack Obama is expected to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their journey will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery program,” Breese said.
He had not mentioned anywhere that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading by the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or even seizures for the purpose of interrogations carried out by CIA muscle axes.
Another statement detailed how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting afterward whether Europe was ready to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had stated on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for the Renewal of Lighting
The United Nations has proposed a plan to renew lighting for households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG), which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan occupies its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of FCKW emitted to the earth due to the lighting would be avoided if the white glowing bulbs, which until now still represent a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, were set by fluorescent or better, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to the equivalent of 70% of the global fleet’s exhaust gases.
In Copenhagen last year, major exhaust gas emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CHP emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy demand is again reduced by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company has participated in the UN study by the way - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white incandescent bulb, which is intended to convey an indication of the savings possibilities of the replacement plan.
In addition to the fact that esee completely novel bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they need to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Excitedly Expects Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to retain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a UN chief's spokesman said.
"He calls on all parties and institutions in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had allowed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight to expire three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have been made, but the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" voting in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo opponents, however, are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denied any connection to the ex-rebels, called the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he did not go as far as claiming victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
The United Nations had warned Ivorian politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in the event of any escalations.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of elections on October 31 with 38% of the vote, compared with 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (IAA), is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
Unemployment in the metropolis stands at 2.631 million.
Second-quarter figures amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
Looking more closely, 3.4 million French metropolitan workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate in the metropolis of 24.2% (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25%, including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youth between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, in turn, saw a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482,000 of those over 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne (PS) region, an investigation was initiated and he was sent to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of public property, embezzlement of public goods, euthanasia, accomplices in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak out on any questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading cerebral palsy."
“It’s easy to subject him to a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client’s hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made it important to send a memorandum to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers to justify him.
A Guérini member, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
Simon said he would never have been aware of the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the public service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then put back on the loose under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were indicted and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “unauthorized influence and passive bribery”.
Two civil servants of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "prejudice and misappropriation of public property by an agent of public service", the other on the basis of "complication in misappropriation of public funds".
Jeannie Peretti, Alexandre Guérini's life partner, was also charged with "healing and subjugation of social property".
Among the persons confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public-handed machinations that had affected Corsica.
The banners suspect his society of having contributed to the laundering of money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the disposal sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the urban catchment area of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as a mediator for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "espionage", held the French public in awe, alarmed diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between the two countries.
All this under the watchful eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of “hostage” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a man imprisoned in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trafficking in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a clear light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostages".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée strategy consultant, spoke with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything in their power to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without omission" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"The more you do this, the more the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because "silence solves nothing", past the discussion attempts on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "hostage for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to be made on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands from Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronics, has been released from prison following the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this troubling coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which tracks Iran’s illegal networks’ acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program.
Did France buy a cow?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice," (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser selects a phone number, reposts it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an “important” and “influential mediator role” through statements and “flight attempts” organized by the media.
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, summoned "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to lapse into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts “are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 was perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved.
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris tries to "bring Syria to the forefront of what promise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "seek discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided in her: “Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything.”
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Cinderella” that will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, government officials said.
A bill aimed at urging online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 after midnight is presented to parliament in December, representatives of ministries of culture and family said.
“Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal daytime life.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the French news agency Agence France Presse's ministerial representative, said in a statement.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
Producer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also keen to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit granted for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events related to intense Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In clear excitement over suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice in which ranging for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself in 2010 after the premiere on the African continent, or to continue pursuing its headquarters in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could equally well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to play the world championship once, namely in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had once again given him nourishment by broadcasting a documentary report targeting three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the British officials who have been lobbying heavily with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-edition of the chess move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort suffice to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a significant outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unconverted hint at the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
“They’re being blamed with dirt, they’re trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
The world’s first economic power, the headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s eagerly-awaited 2026 World Cup approval for China, which will void Asian chances for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar having pulled all the registers with the advent of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time lag) acquitted by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The Second Mandate: Publicity
De Gaulle had really sneered.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stuttering.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But publicity is not well-received on the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to act as if doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term would not be ruled out without even believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians would accuse the prospect of "two mandates" had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Missed a lot.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday no longer make him a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they should provoke comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the opening of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS urge earlier than assumed to campaign.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a poll by BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the prime minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he found a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with the publicity.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Board last year should provide an opportunity to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures that are due to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, without a doubt, not to allow the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets to be brought about, so as not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
France’s Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt at a press conference yesterday.
It has not dared to say whether it believes the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not shown much talk about his projects on the eve of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels on the day before, but rather is content to point out that, as the program of buying and selling of state-owned securities on the Secundary Markets, we would like to point out that on the eve of
Only certainty: the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases from the ECB were doubled last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders that the anticipation of pursuing the purchase price will continue (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the ECB’s arsenal of bond transactions lasting more than three months has already disappeared, the latter will still be able to make use of the unrestricted cash reserves in a free way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already realizing today that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank, suspects.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," counters Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revives the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of European banks’ exposure to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“At any price, it must take the place of the lacking investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states,” a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if the interest rates go up, the states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi's government to cover up in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a bit yesterday with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional president Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and expected him to have an "unpredictable" weekend, which the concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at least, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated swindling tax revenues that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available to the Senate for examination is projected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still make up 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% forecast by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the turmoil for a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
“The fundamentals of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are settled, which we have been repeating for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), Italy is demanding less stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief executive of the OEC.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the planned elections could already be organized at the end of March.
There is therefore an unfavourable period ahead for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although quite relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization is not yet possible.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdensome for the banking systems," said the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies within it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of the unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the euro area countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first publicity spending by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted to Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized through the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
It is incumbent on both sides to avoid, at all costs, having to ask for international assistance before they set up their own budget corrections and have decided on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to step into its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This instrument exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinised in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are at their peak.
Snow and Glacier: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow events are still causing transport difficulties, particularly in Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on Orange alert due to the imminent risk of snow and frost.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 départements already in Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm are expected, occasionally also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic disruptions and impair certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to traffic police, who abstain from using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures have been put in place for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls upon motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris-Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is recalled.
In order to guide the start of construction of the SGP, the state has issued a capital injection of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a part of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Today, we have finally reached the first highs.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
First, as can be seen from Article 15 of the bill, goes "in favor of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to transfer this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that contribute?
A riddle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
Of the 4 billion, we are far away.
"It is being implemented that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital contribution, which will be imposed by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement can be found.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenues (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the planning for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the four promised billions of which can be sought for a long time to come, runs the risk of triggering a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revengeful Hackers and Emsige Spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of sanctity that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (of any x-nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read in any newspaper for months anyway (except for those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the appallingly caricatured profile of Stdafi's offered to Kaba.
The rule that the secret files should consist only of news already known is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that each work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same goes for the secret acts.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited minded) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Dezernat was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a reversal made around the disclosures of these dossiers?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely, that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government have been able to call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representational tasks, have given themselves up to spoofing.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can capture the most secretive secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Dezernat.
In addition, the scandal brings fewer victims than rather the "sharp judges" in distress.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control loop stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker—chosen as the citizen’s avenger—can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrecy, as it was to reveal the public sphere of WikiLeaks that I was leaking to Le Hill;
WikiLeaks has done no wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this defamation inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer provide any reserved information online - this would be like a hangover stuck on the street corner.
But it’s equally obvious that it’s futile to hope with current technologies to keep confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a head of state is moving in an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
In the future, how could certain relationships be maintained privately and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and novelty, but I see myself forced to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way, deliberately on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in mere memory, carrying the information with them, and beyond.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film band by rewinding from the back to the front and venting all the secrets of editing, while the (numerical) CDs today allow nothing more than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro-portions.
With the high-speed trains you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires by plane including the changeover of three and a half hours.
It is therefore not uncommon for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called “fast start” or early funding) realised by the developing countries.
And the coarse French beauties have already been uncovered.
The Copenhagen Treaty commits developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its true value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had mobilised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to pay the 7.2 billion it pledged in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional spending has been made without detrimental to public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline value that they consider to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as the benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained, and the fast-start funding will add 150 million over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words: there are no guide values for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
Concretely, the overall amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> as the equivalent of 1 donated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Obviously, this is only difficult to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction of projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is taken as the equivalent of a donated euro. In addition, the cost of the loan should be taken as the equivalent of the amount of the loan.
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros, by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% complying with their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries do not completely let go...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of a drop in the UNFCCC’s immense machinery.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could put forward discussions on the disputed subject of long-term financing (another crucial and currently debated topic): the question of "predictability" or the way in which its loans are accounted for cannot be avoided.
France could change its position to be as progressive on issues of dispute as it is on other things.
So the hope is based on the new Minister of the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “predictability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals over the course of the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "given the small number of samples analyzed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustrative character of the issue treated", had between July and September the typically within four, from about a ten-year-old child to meals consumed food plus an O-meal at the supermarkets.
These typical meals—including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetable parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day—were examined as well as dairies from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded, it is very well understood from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine-disrupting factor is a concern."
Already at breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included at lunch, in which the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the minced steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this “pollutant cocktail” to the consumer “is likely to be underestimated,” the study said.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, for its part, proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilisational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
