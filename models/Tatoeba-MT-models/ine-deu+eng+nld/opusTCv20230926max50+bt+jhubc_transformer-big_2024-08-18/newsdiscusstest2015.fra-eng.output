The rest of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn’t be used to pay for those who come to the UK doing health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specific arguments, and then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue up behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing madmen, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel is not evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, it just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specific argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised a lot, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You will need to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher disciples who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the '' TIGER OF EUROPE'' was bragging a few years ago.
We've seen the sequel!
This is starting to read the article again.
We are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ‘NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE’ is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not what to ''pavoir'' for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is certainly in view of the recent event.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only small businesses pay the full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on all corners of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be on fire soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I’ll be flying with him next week, so hopefully it won’t be on either of those two once refitted.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay a surcharge for the additional fear that we wanted to give them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay for something other than the basic fare just have to take it for themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally engulfs the world.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue <0xC3><0xA0> l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, crowded with 50% tourists.
<0x40>Aloe Faux.
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they are buying at a tax deduction.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows prices to fall.
Sunday rest is a right that employees enjoy, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister in charge of the economy nor the Minister in charge of foreign affairs have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
While they're locking her up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on a.m. Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life which he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill at the helm during these five years, just these five years, and no one else.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the estate fees, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive asset to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real French evil: mistrust of the dialogue
Return to the principal values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he is RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above it is a vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of shortage of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way could a new deal be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate and energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc...
Taxation that favors high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a true galoppist.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung has lost me as a customer, but not to the benefit of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they can not be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to design, for them options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform”.
Is there “a better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is of interest to us all.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting ideas about gender and indicate to us the works that they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have her liveliness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and frankly I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my arrears, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>John: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what do we fear those who are afraid?
Furasato and <0x40> give us some answer elements.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutter.
We can see how much these studies touch the most intimate at home.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
<0x40> Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for the idea debate, I thought we should go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exposure that their critics make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our Umpfrontist friend, there is the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat cutter, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of the "source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really enclose the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself up for the entire week of Perseid meteor showers and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I’m starting to think that there’s a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, although things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess over you when he (or she) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Stunning photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these arguments are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion.
The Department of the Economy is telling us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will decision-makers who have reaped the political benefits of the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
<0x40>lol No The state is not comparable to households when it comes to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless government spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments that guarantee future growth and hence future revenues.
A few elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
A beautiful conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have hands bound by law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
Politicians want to please the uneducated masses on these issues.
By the way, doctors do not make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health care system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to put the blame on the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize business profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditures and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or only on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that hold them back and the expensive permits they need.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If “researchers” in the social sciences were doing research instead of politics and networking, their “work” could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy, not research.
One cannot say “research is done” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment everything”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The Pisa tests are just an indicator make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what is arranging for you, a willingness to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Read the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not much argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system " .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
To give more weight to education theorists would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally flawed: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would still less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of combating copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> theft.
It is the same since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same.
By using content without having the proper license, you are depriving artists of their earnings.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what should constitute reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have passed with a click.
Maybe if they share the headphones from their mp3 walker with a buddy on the school bus, they should be kicked out for breaking the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we're overflowing with, the scrambler who says everything's going wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they will be able to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What draws France down are the speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I had the chance to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the null bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large companies and medium-sized and small companies - What are French bosses waiting for to do the same??
Should the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of impertinence?
<0x40> Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leader couplet on your part!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is confronted with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who squander and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, paid work 45h/week 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the lowering of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last hasn’t really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But Labour is going to get us bored, isn’t it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision is finally overturned.
And better yet: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail’s operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all help each other across borders.
We can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This is perhaps because the management of the Dutch is on good track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a beating girl.”
Lord, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beaten" is a higher quality than many others, the care of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beaten" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beaten", who are no less dead, I know of those who are beaten.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start over too.
I'm not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I'm telling you that it HELPES..
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that one can depreciate not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that is lazy, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think the opposite, if, having a solid morale makes it probably easier to accept heavy treatments and to prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is battling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to rely on the "Lord" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I “fighted” as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in clenching the teeth, suffering hell, and taking the punches.
I believed that the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
Hey, what's going on?
It's a birthday.
It's a forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist who became a nationalist who sparked three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please, ask what we have deliberately left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the Least Rule of International Law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was swiftly recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not being able to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, only in Greece does a method of predicting earthquakes work, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for letting us share the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules at the University of Maryland" and Dr. Jonke's study.
The method to follow.
Just like those involving animals that feel a threat coming.
Thank you Science Passer for giving us, often, these experimental feats that are accomplished in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report about the struggle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to make their work recognized as valid that concerned the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and more specifically to their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we bump into the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand why you might think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep a single one.
That just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because it's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in Have I Got News For You.
Because it's a celebrity and we instilled in people the adoration of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the rest of the country will vote for him.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crack the ceiling I'm sure.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what we used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read a few books (there are, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Smash Strait" speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually passed Savo Island, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the eco-friendly side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to achieve the objective completely decredits the concept.
Just scroll through the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
An operation of com more neither done nor to do.
The cow, it makes too much desire!!!
I am looking forward to the web series!
Your recitation makes me revisit, identifying myself a bit in the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reviewing us, and show proudly that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red hat that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a penny of our taxes to fund the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I do not know if they are still in the team
This is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in Velez's big team who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had such greats as Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal teammate Weo, Ars).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he is not a titular.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn’t too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to the neighboring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" when seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and probably children are inside?
How ???
What bothers me a bit about this “testimony” is that the only fact that I have been able, even if only once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a “border line” personality whose “testimonies” should all be taken with the greatest care.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically harm the great evil Satan in his own heart.
To make qqch powerful.
The grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
A classic delight.
We doubted it a bit.
The Western “Christian/White/Gaulian” cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Completely in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
As we have seen before, Muslims should not be pushed back.
That's the only way.
Edwy Plennel has read this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in the fall.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of on the verge of dying.
In the UK, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grunting that raves clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the germs outside, that can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances , it is the amount collected by the State that mainly comes from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households whose taxes have increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are affected ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The removal of half of the part concerning mainly widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under-evaluated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on the straw though, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear far more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s go on like this and you’ll encourage those 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been surpassed, money serves only to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are one of the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or even lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing .
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head cutters have happily lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem. No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to introduce ourselves at the front desk or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and leave.
From now on, this will be my first option when I am traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and very risky” No, that’s not true.
You just really missed your luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a down payment and a month’s rent at once but I’m a bit scared to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” sang the Bu$herie in every tone...
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not super clear the style of the author: « in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're all in agreement.
Do you think it’s time to weaken the military to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly enhanced if they were “worked” for 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
By the way, it's so much plank at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't get to fill the CAPES with maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to be sniffed by poorly-educated chiards whose parents spit at you like you're a scoundrel?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurde population can flourish better.
We can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 a year and they didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
Don’t worry about it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed at the graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan
I don't like working in companies so I hope to be in the public service or academia in the long run.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisonourous disciplines such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political science, that is, what is called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I have finished as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
While the starting salary was lower, the ranks are quickly climbing because in the real world, results matter more than knowledge.
This debate about engineering/artistic studies has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Are letters, philosophy, and art a bit of a crossroads?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diplomas like media study or whatever the absconding field you've gone to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real chains.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and who highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to disentangle Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I can’t see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d’Oise making 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner-walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport otherwise more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and closed parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
As well as benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for ONLY a bicycle hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not good at all.

The cycle paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
Not a word on the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% cycling trips is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In fact, according to OR, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world is changing.
That sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority in charge of airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down earlier, Ukraine was launching in the area of air attacks against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurper government/Ukraine’s ultranationalists from the West – and wanting to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 International Court of Justice ruling that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such an eco booger, it's awkward!
To be called Polar is to lose the North is delightful.
One question from Beotian: Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty’s book haven’t read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequalities of labor income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that today’s concentration of capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after the war.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, it can be debated without having read the book, the essence of which is to argue in one direction in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press wrong?
I have not read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it seems to me that this one is pure fumistry.
The concept of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become richer overall?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the young girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old saying that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think that his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “perverse colored” people?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely outrageous.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favor of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having her say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich societal character.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange Bof Bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to have all of a sudden to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it was above all the risks of staging and editing that satisfies me.
AHS has an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the acceptance of today's productions.
I miss a little seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it’s just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end like 24 hours chronos quot.
Everyone does what they want, right?
It is by what I say “I will not look again” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think will be fatal to her.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax hikes, please - rather cut in state spending.
No, let's increase expenses, please.
Those who wanted to squander their spending have failed.
Unleash controversy about relatively small spending items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and all the while some, in each camp, are pretending that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is not something to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government seizing a third of my income (before even talking about taxes on consumption) if I thought it would use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes them look good.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car vignette, and that’s before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not seek, it means that 80% seek and do not find.
Since I am unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of that.
In fact, I haven't heard from the Employment Center in months, which means that the agents are more busy with control operations than really bringing in job postings?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to do without Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do their duty well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport licence from the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times that I had a job at the Employment Centre, my rights at the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, I had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Registration and control is currently taking over, while statutorily Pole Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, it is they who pay the costs.
Politicians and non-wage French people are giving themselves rights that they don’t actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of employee work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hadj in Mecca this year for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 people have been denied a visa because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That it happens to convey the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the cortexes of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception here.
It’s only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity’s given premium, while religion, coming from the cerebellum, has directed our actions since Lucy maybe.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, you can only see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will allow to touch more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisage existed before Christ.
Hillel a century earlier said to him, "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, it's the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "promoting justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It's not made up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department’s joysticks block all nice sites.
Hello, is that <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Please note that the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's null.
It's time to buy a new video card *don't worry*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat Emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to scold the people who buy it there while they are out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was 1940’s France a “rotten land”?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in literature one wonders whether Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, you don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians are going to read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relation to literature.
Have you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
You will appreciate mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to meet Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter and 2005, D.
Salute to the atrocious.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I have seen Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to smash me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was bordelic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach 95 years old I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That being said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're moving away from the subject a little bit.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for jihadists to leave the mosques.
It reports the arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental counter-measure: all the authorities, representative organizations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who says the word consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs, or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoch Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delinquency of French society.
If there is no doubt, so to speak.
Who says no, but agrees to what?
Consent to closeness to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to save the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the election, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have any seats.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs are asking their leader to be held accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Circulating the 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and she did it well.
However, he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015 and this since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
This is “The Life of Others” from East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next post: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay as a world.
Highly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I have to read the pirated files, books from the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without junk.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, there's no regrets.
I am appalled by the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also some demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably derogatory.

It is the data published by Kobo that it is, not allowing to identify the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a kindergarten class full of children with schizophrenia under acid.
This is even worse than this if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Indian Punchline reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the c*nneries swayed by the traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read keeping in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings coming from Iran in 1979 to suggest Afghanistan around
Who are these “moderate” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
The pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent “moderates” pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism into account.” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
“Should” be needed?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a paved place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of a founding.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, one in vain seeks contact with the real.
Just clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a childish desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.

The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "commercialization" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are they not also commercialization of bodies?
Anachronistic Father Unit ...

It is not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.

I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it was vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will once again pass soul vinyls, including full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here is a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.

I loved your documentary.

Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue to occupy and colonize (by the way, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli robbed him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower its guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has been the case ever since politics was globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it will continue!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What power ratio allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force!
Do you doubt it?!!!
Plus, it’s not all about Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-Chomskyist billesses written not others.
That proves you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a sequel to personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, maybe truths we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms to vote and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles / videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) is the only way to get rid of it.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are girouettes who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it's really outrageous to be able to see all these condescending answers that say this.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be fine if people debated what he was actually saying rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large amount of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot into a ballot box every 5 years annoys me deeply since my vote really doesn't count for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group together under the label “pseudo-Chomskyst billesses.”
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headgear added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “fronde” reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the DVRs of History, where professional historians have become a minority and where the exchange of specialists has become impoverished for the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po type for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop one or the other of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on those scapegoats who are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that for Foucault, the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or / libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to seek state help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / no state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support for anything else.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too fast if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand going from allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the attitude of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where in Russia was it that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
Chinese people think the same way about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-White.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mostly have prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aboriginal peoples.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories of them, all people get along and, in fact, those in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people get along, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
There is no measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the judiciary union...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly right.
When it comes to the Judiciary Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as well as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The tool required by law to refocus the assessment on fundamentals then remains.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
Claim and misrepresentation are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to correctly inscribe the following in the third ratio.
The one from the corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field in question is that of the robbery* of heirs committed up to the means of fraud to the procedure* by succession genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession earns <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million in good and bad while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this comes along with the statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs who are reluctant to be spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Absolutely prohibitive prices.
More equipment to cheat the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with cumbersome wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog snout on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a handicapped with a penchant for longboarding.
There are some hills that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, though.
Many of them have insurance of a reasonable amount at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
One cannot really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, this is just a draft, it is not planned to make it.
I AGREE that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't make it to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intense shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under the Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh, it's not the tongue of wood, it's the concrete and armed lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Also remember that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The bloc is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the backdrop of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it is getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in a different way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, homeowners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, circumventing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What are you renting on?”
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to do a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I really tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty, this is a good one) on Airbnb
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The boats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our boats...
Where are you going to moor it?
Marine Le Pen is wrong.
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is on the rise in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the rich is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer.
High finance, speculum, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, then our food, with the care structures, then our health, with our debts, then our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this in favor of some hyper-mega-obese money.
FH said: “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank minister, history of better defending the interests of the banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else who competed?
How do you call it: turn your jacket over, lower your pants?
Primary and Populist Reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if that was still the case at the end of the battle.
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in the middle of the day.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn’t really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped firing, and a pursuit race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, tilted and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlights at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned about reports indicating a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, trying in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and so could not look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have badly damaged them, so in the confusion they ran away to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
There are several voices at the UMP asking for it to be inscribed in the law that a convict is therefore permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the electorate of the left of course.
But nooon, that's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSAL A REGISTRATION TO THE WALL OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to soften those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little billboards" money for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted the personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your affirmations are completely free.
If, at present, the right deprives the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that fall under it!
We do not have an example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the object of his attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should also be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judiciary union and is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are citing may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
It is now questioned whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate the all-one-everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most hungry fool of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard all competed in Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else took part in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
Rare are those who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
Either way, most singers/bands can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it is more likely to result in a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitarists who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a primary school level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch out.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quickly enough to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us these people far away as infinitely superstitious and full of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are practically, strictly equivalent to what they do.
Unless you are recklessly interpreting the opposite.
That is, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moli<0xC3><0xA8>res also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is like a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever it is.
It's ephemeral decor to furnish the void.
That's all.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw at the nettles not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is entirely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that one constantly discovers treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today, we have so powerful technical and scientific means that the interleaving of excavations is better but can still be questioned by other discoveries!
We are in the midst of (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The shamans of prehistory”, especially the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the trap?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical about it on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could have expected that kind of comment from you.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, I can suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than make me laugh with those childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away, then.
If these “childlike ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Did you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we can find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video of the crash on the net...???
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers, it would have released the safety because at the time another vehicle (e.g. a debugging machine) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish soon before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV law, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Of course, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the English that led then...
On this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I've got a little time to dig out all your fucking shit.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant history of the possibility of victory of one driver at the expense of another.
It’s not the FOM that brings safety out because it’s the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA to avoid such annoying questions as: How is it that the commissioner waving a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag waving, sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark lack of knowledge of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime AFTER the crash site, hence the agitated green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of commissioners just downstream of the accident (as the case may be at 10 meters as at 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal run.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, the advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “derailing,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who are freaking out that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism in reverse.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without coming to hysteria) so that the government can make us slip when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself invented.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it had to be horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I’m bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years....
Absolutely useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only do the testimonies serve no purpose: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective appraisal of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from loved ones.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
What is the basis of your research, then?
On ghosts?
Do you put on the same level fanciful theories and facts (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the sly word grown up by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D’Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the “resilience” blow.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he has crafted a reliable measurement scale for us to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Sentinels of the air could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
Why is that?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang out?
The only solution that comes to mind is the Pipi-Caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging out.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I’m looking forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to redistribute the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years that we have one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now go to 05:30 from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this series every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the esplanades mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves a political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have failed to find anything.
The Temple Mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately referred to the government (Naftali Bennett, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and undermined it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize His people?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naiads half-naked, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as you can see in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to bury the Jewish faithful underneath, praying to the Wall of Lamentation.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that must be condemned.
This system is unsustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be on the upswing, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grieving and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that we don’t fuck people with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it is sustainable.
I totally agree with you.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held.
Have you voted for the ICC?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will do to our lives.
It is only recently that we have begun to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
That’s what makes for great returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth there were trade unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) think of herself as the safe house of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, to have this little relic, it is comforting.
Although for her, it is becoming more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, single men, married women, single men, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I'm syndicated.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of class interests, protected professions with trade unions are already suffering well enough, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We ask not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or otherwise without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster is assured.
And with the carts being prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (however misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has ever done anything like “boum, here’s my fucking cake now eat it and bow before your master!”
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outside people were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love to cook, but I can’t imagine doing that.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to deviate from, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glaze on Richard's mill didn't make you want to, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allocated.
There is also the cancer that is waiting, with the solar wind blows.
Definitely, we are all succeeding at the moment.
It’s a bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “throw” ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the benefit of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVAs and most UVBs through.
Do you know that you are not obligated to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a survivor when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am a melanoma addict, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke it.
As proof: not all tanned people have melanomas.
That is, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or switch it to the mixer...
I think the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if you apply enough strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and as such has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication hardware.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for the Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, you imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and you don't see how it could get back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......................................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
This article is about bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrials produce in "industrials" We emphasize super u but all the brands and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear it.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without resentment, I kiss you
They are called bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It is the total disgroupment of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesturing, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example, condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and squalor, so do not be surprised to often encounter critics about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself in it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Have you understood the concept of left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecology in the short term.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of ecology because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly done that she vaguely resembles a female nude.
Fuck, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's pork.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a lot of savings to be made: riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty forces us to say that France is declining, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local communities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
<0x40>edmond: That’s what I said, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it’s really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gum is certain.
That all those who have sided little or enough the military thing dare to come here, eyes in eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting of laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really reluctant: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense may find itself a little burdened!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees on should be done, you have to see it somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with every closure of posts, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy about the savings made in public spending.
This article is truly the most amazing thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling through his Facebook feed and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus while going to work and only realizes where his skirt got back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and clench his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that satirical journalism is at the very top of the cosmic universe!
I'm in the wrong place!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and insurmountable genius that emanates from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really stupid.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the puck at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Wind turbines and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit yourself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind power or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm a 1981 State Doctor of Physical Sciences plus I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I was saying and like all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gas of less effect than Co2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapour and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The race to the low cost pitcher is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold helium.
So maybe we are not in a design flaw, but in implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They might be paying for the satellites in frigates who knows..
This is all the more disastrous as many media loop back the only headlines of articles – and many readers only remember those headlines.
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Absolutely agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project while it is just a thrower problem.
