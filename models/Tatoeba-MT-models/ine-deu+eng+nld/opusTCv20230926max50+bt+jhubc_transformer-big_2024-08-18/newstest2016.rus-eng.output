The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of the travel allowance in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social map of the resident of the Ivanovo region changes.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia on the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the privileges for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social map in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law on the National Payment System.
At the same time, the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application change.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in travel, as before, but in the amount of funds, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in summer - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, and the rest of the money.
The cost of the preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff in force with the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with cash remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on the social map with accuracy to the cents.
In addition, the possibility of refunding subscribed but unexpended funds appears.
We will also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier's budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the department of road economy and transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card is provided for more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend
During a 911 call, a teacher at the university, Shannon Lamb, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to his home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said contacts of the deceased's family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note, carelessly handwritten on a white sheet of lynched paper: "I'm so sorry, I'd like to take it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lab said in a note.
There was no indication that Lamb, who ran two online courses at the University of the State of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to drive 300 miles to the university campus by then, where he was believed by police to have shot all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the verge.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said the university staff learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly afterward.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as police surrounded him.
The day after a shooting at a school forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, officials were still trying to put together the motives that prompted Lamb.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped paint a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gothia, where Prentiss died, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “beautiful people” with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, “as if something were wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he was coping with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the University of Delta to give him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in university admissions rules meant that the degree of doctor Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him the automatic acquisition of a teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb after his escape from the campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself from a 38-caliber refueling gun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, according to Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson.
His engine-powered car was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began working at a university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carla Hearston said she was 15 and Lamba 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play the guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls were burning when he was around,” says Hearston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for some time at the time of the events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house whose back side goes out to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Sean O'Stean, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Stin said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he hadn't dated Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar in the outskirts of Gothier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing the guitar and lip harmonica.
There was nothing suspicious observed.
"It's just a happy couple," he said.
We laughed and laughed at each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a late teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English language teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
On the campus of the University of the State of the Delta in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a commemorative candle-lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is a day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was prepared by the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while a toy and children’s goods retailer says it will give staff and temporary workers the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although there are still months left before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer and the companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his ‘date’ with Princess Diana.
The premiere of “Back to the Future” turned out to be a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and here I was shadowed - Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I’m literally at a distance with my outstretched arm and in one false shoe from a date with Princess of Wales.
"Back to Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film “Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “this is arguably the greatest time-travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia’s military support for Syria, that there is “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in weapons will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the disbanded UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation insoluble."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Isn't Joking
Some have tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some are calling for a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump’s high position in the polls, they haven’t (yet) succeeded.
Ten of the last 11 national polls have demonstrated Donald Trump’s advantage in ambiguous numbers, and some are starting to seriously question what this means for a real estate mogul in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
This is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point to the fact that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry ceded his primacy to German Kane, who was gaining popularity, none of whom won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Supercommittee of Political Activity and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump’s indistinguishable power and begin to take their dollars to overturn him.
Here are some survey numbers that show that a real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans are now in favor of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are at their peak in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of voters for the GOP would appoint Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “delighted” or “pleased” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disturbed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “delighted” versus 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “unsatisfied” or “disturbed” if the establishment’s favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who could be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are accustomed to this idea.
When they wear their hats to connoisseurs, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a spread is likely to play into Trump’s advantage, and at the same time those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Cashich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got no one with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to pass it?
Ben Carson overtook the businessman for 19 points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to pick Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his campaign speech two months ago, the topic of immigration has become the most topical in the conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s pogrom will distract key Latin American voters from the Republican Party and impede rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration gets the public’s attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans said in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with experience in government.
And they are also offended by Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “angry.”
The government will decide the fate of the indexation of pensions in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodec said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that the solution should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget for the following year was submitted to the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the cumulative pension of Russians.
Golodec noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the next year is about the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Holodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for it.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are centuries often irritated and red?
Answered ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova:
Our ages are screens that protect the eyeball from the multitude of tiny particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about regular cleansing of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The output is simple:
not three eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day clean the edges of the eyelids from accumulated in them for a day of harmful substances.
Cleansing procedures are not unnecessarily supplemented and warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salfea, chamomile), liquefying the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelid, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pads of the fingers;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Koreans created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor - the Yongben nuclear complex - was operating "at full capacity".
The report appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in both quantity and quality".
The last nuclear weapons test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that it managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium- and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian News Service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all quadrilaterals, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the Tsar of the Guards", and the Russian tricolor replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, bloodshed continues and people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
This year, about 500,000 migrants arrived in the EU countries, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently stepped up border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that around 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the figures significantly large.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbyn, the Prime Minister is looking forward to his debut at the session
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, will speak for the first time to the Prime Minister at a session of questions, for the first time measuring forces with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six separate questions in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theater and more facts” at a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as head; it will take place after his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tred-Union congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent while performing the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and has become the subject of several leading articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbyn’s spokesman said he “stands in a respectful silence” and acknowledged the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.”
However, shadow cabinet member Mr. Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economics, defense and international politics, while less than one-six members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political disagreements are also “buzzing a pile” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment to a post in the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn stated at the Tred-Union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labour and pensions minister, said the party had "complete clarity" that it was in opposition to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron at the mailbox in the last decade since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, said he had “gathered collective resources” to get Mr. Cameron’s ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Aylington North County said that the Prime Minister's issues are causing excessive confrontation, and that he will refrain from both witty answers and the exchange of quantities, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems for young people.
Mr. Corbyn stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on Prime Minister's issues when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying he had approached House Speaker John Burke to discuss the issue.
Becoming the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to step away from the political style of the "fair-balloon", often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure of questions, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons, and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has turned into a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.
"Shooted in Joburg" Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.
But a group of former homeless people found a way to master the craft and make a living.
“I was filmed in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of their surroundings and make money on it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound sterling is growing as wages rise in the UK
The pound grew against the backdrop of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to a bid to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a shift to an earlier period of forecasts for possible quote growth.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, the shares of SABMiller were allocated, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world’s largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9% amid encouraging news from a competing group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it was able to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi led the decline in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports shares grew after the sportswear supplier reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax earnings for six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages May Hinder Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Coughill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor, he says.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up initiative campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from pressure from Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up wholesale food supplier has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi’s upcoming $700 million infusion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through Showaide marketing in leading media and social media outlets and on the event.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers, such as ice cream maker Simmo's from Dansboro, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australia Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day when this wholesale food, beverage and household goods supplier will spend its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There’s a lot going on, as IGA-branded stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA’s network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in the South and 24 percent in the WA compared to about 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will seize 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Losses in revenues and sales of food products at a high level of constant costs Metcash could cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is despite a recent Morgan Survey study finding that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to those attending a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash “may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas’s comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share fell from 18 percent in 2010 to 14 percent, and Metcash’s food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell by 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational delivery and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to align retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions per week and helping IGA retailers reshape retail outlets, as well as offering a rapidly expanding assortment of fresh products and a wider selection of branded products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price alignment and redevelopment are gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve net profit gains in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis backs Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly hurt in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kirios and deserves more honor than criticism for his behavior, Tennis Australia President Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, a junior in a talented duo and often referred to as the "Special Ks", has been involuntarily in the spotlight due to Kirios' shameful tie with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the tall judge had to double-cross Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, with Harrison stating, "Wawrinka was supposed to put on Kirios's shoulders, and I'm supposed to put it on his lap."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hillie loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the United Kingdom.
“I’m acutely concerned about one thing, namely that the Tanashis were dragged into the conflict,” Hili said.
He really broke the racket when he got his foot in the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes broke, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think we've done him a little unfair.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he fits perfectly in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected off the court, he trains intensively, he is in great shape, he is a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Heidi also backed the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual agreement" is the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the disputes around [Kiryos],” said Hili.
And I think that Nick gained strength very quickly, that is proved by people like Federer and Murray, he grows in front of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we are trying to help him to realize the consequences of his actions better, and I think it is necessary to take him out of the center.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed the border with Serbia on the southern border and detains those trying to enter the country illegally to contain the influx of migrants.
At the border there were riots - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Stuck indefinitely on a section of the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence at home broke down tents and settled in this area.
However, dissatisfaction has increased.
When a police helicopter was flying over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian special-purpose police.
In protest, some of them refused to eat or drink.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared the expulsion of migrants from Hungary “unacceptable” as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the associated damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the next day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to take joint responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) according to which EU member states would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from the EU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency EU summit to be held next week to discuss the migration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The declared state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence at the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were connected to urgent work on completing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “close place” and point of crossing the EU border for migrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, the country’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more secure life rather than refugees – victims of hostilities who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply different from the views of other EU countries.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) fence made of barbed wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for trafficked people.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are at the border, have been observing the presence there for several days armed to the teeth with vehicles and dogs.
Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s national security adviser, Dierd Bacondi, said 45 people tried to cross the border at the border and another 15 inside the country were caught by authorities.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, driving a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The riots erupted on the main passageway across the border near the city of Roeske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed an office space for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through.
About 20 people were able to penetrate the interior, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the refusal of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among the primary Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the election, a majority of Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’ll support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton retains a large advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters up to the age of 50 has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in the group.
Nearly half of the primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It may come as no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question as to why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 percent), then – that now is the time of the woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president contemplates a potential turnout, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race — though a third think he shouldn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party’s candidates, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would have chosen Biden as second, which is more than Sanders’s.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
On this indicator, Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in a candidate, Democrat voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similarly to last month’s situation, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, showed good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads by honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a certain opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic primary voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal mailbox and server in her capacity as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and feel that it has not adversely affected their overall view of her.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy over email has had no impact on their overall view of Clinton, although 36 percent say their view of it has deteriorated.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters to be honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it to be honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush showed the best score in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as more of an honest person than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates scored half of the vote in the new poll, leaving all the rest in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate has risen from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of highly educated Republican voters.
The remaining candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson’s rise in polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several critical strikes against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of the first-year student of Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was filed against five people.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity from New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Dengue during a dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him in time to the hospital, which resulted in his death," the police said.
Officials say a blindfolded student and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back were pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and were supposedly waiting an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They, however, found time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Dengue,” said Chief Wagner.
He could not be rescued, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity rituals because at least one student dies during them each year since 1970," Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must bear responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jurors of Monroe County pleaded in favor of the charge of murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with newcomer violence and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants to account, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or informally, then so is it,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbade fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded a local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will collapse into a recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will be before the offensive, and how long it will continue.
For the economy in particular, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, but not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the U.S. Central Bank administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
There are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the futility around raising rates is exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal but still low levels to be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for a rate hike can lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate increases, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t seem to slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike results.
If more specifically, the market for the last about 35 years has changed more often than not - about 14 percent - in the direction of increasing the rates, remains fairly even for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, the sales of the stock return to the normal state with an average yield of 14.4 percent, the price of the stock for the last six cycles
Deutsche says the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate hike stage, and earnings from stocks are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raises in stakes often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the entire duration of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few people believe it will be long, even though it is only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic backdrop can be risky and raises the question “whether this time will be different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve System all year round, with their views tied to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe the FOMC could have approved a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all rate hike cycles to date have been in a super-cycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP, overlapping peaks leading up to the recession, very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period of the election.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, all lasting 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to that for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will occur faster than for stocks when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the onset of the first rate increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategy specialists at Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will lead to yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds getting closer, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we’re still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says Katy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system’s policy.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the Federal system's policies.
In general, companies that do their main business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in a worse position as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial one.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks demonstrate above-market efficiency within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with a stable financial position circumvented firms with an unstable financial position as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-yield companies, as well as low-volatility stocks, also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
High-interest floating-rate companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see profit through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,” says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lowering standards"
It proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just blown away by the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who ran into The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of parliament said, prompting the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station appeared to be “stupid” and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems like — I don’t like to use the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to turn into Classic FM,” he said.
It also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC director general denied the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and creating music is not really like anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davie claimed that the radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC who was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an approximate price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home stall” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the license fee, for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it was first observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could have contributed to the containment of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost cities.
But experts say there have now been signs of aligning online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since it began fixing in 2000, rising by just five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of aligning online sales after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, IMRG’s sales index editor.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people got the opportunity to shop online, and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming to the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could have abstained from purchases on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, shoppers in five times the average hurried to computers to take advantage of profitable offers, breaking down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real fight for profitable purchases, could have made people abstain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 in 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims are buried in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and the family of bin Laden imposed sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapse.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed in a crane crash at Mecca’s main mosque.
Wearing mostly white, those present at the funeral crowded the driveway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who set off on their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A mournful procession passed by a sacred site, where just a few days earlier a construction crane breached the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were given for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company belonging to the bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque, carried through the streets
Among those killed was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane was not working.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, says that Binladin Group is partially to blame for the collapse.
The English news agency's editorial office did not disclose this detail, but said the company's leaders were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives have been unavailable for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia’s closest ruling families for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a traitor, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in a pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every working Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to relatives of the dead, and the same amount irreversibly damaged.
The other victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Lori, Britons are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q warehouses across the country

They say the British put aside hammers and paintbrushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint walls, it seems that nowadays you are in the minority.
Because, according to the owner of the company B&Q, Britons are increasingly hiring master specialists to perform simple work on the house.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home furnishing services, said that this trend is behind a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craft goods and close 60 B&Q warehouses at the same time.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women in B&Q’s store staff, as eight out of ten decisions about shop purchases are made by women of the weaker sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, one cannot fail to notice the recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the arrangement of their dwellings than in the past.
Ms. Lori said: "We still have mostly men working in our stores.
Steps need to be taken to achieve balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in charge of leading UK companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Lori said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took over the costs of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales volumes for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the brands Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank to discuss a two-day decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who last week still believed the Federal Reserve would do it, now believe it will still reschedule and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading employee of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic upswing adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but everything speaks to their confidence that there are chances against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" hundreds of refugees chanted at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to displaced people.
Asylum seekers are already starting to feel other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shido on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboj<0xC5><0xA1>a Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure a humane attitude towards them.
This is already a European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone will cope with this, and especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is relentless:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill in the necessary documents for this.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because in Serbia it is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
For a number of years, Vangelis Meymarakis has been a member of the centre-right governments, which the left believes has led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by ceding to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy has matched it in popularity.
What has changed over this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras chased them.
For the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in the country in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was the case for the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement the program on which they have reached agreement without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meymarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece’s movement on the European path because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras’s negotiation.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in power during the first year wants to bring order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then I am sure that all the commitments that can not be fulfilled due to the fact that the delays can only lead to a recession.
It would be a mistake to assume that already in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we want to restore their trust, we need to continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to take advantage of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many of the key political issues that we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example related to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, said to them?
Vangelis Meymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried our best to implement the 2012 agreement by circumventing the sharp corners.
We are moving forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no prospective buyers willing to pay the price the Greek government agreed to.
I was the speaker of the parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that then constituted the governmental majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations taking place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a mass flow of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Maymarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-moving bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Government of SYRIZA did not act in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, you should act in advance, because if the problem catches up with you, there are only emergency measures left.
And now we are in exactly that situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the Provisional Government, which is given valuable assistance by the President of the Republic who called for the EU summit, will allow a solution to be found.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of actions, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka of the Donetsk region, during the day, the officers of the criminal search of the main police department of the region, together with the military counterintelligence, established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoi Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who was arrested
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the police chief of the region, during the operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the defendant in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a deadly gunshot wound on the man's head.
The investigation department of the Druzhkovsky NGO opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The suspect was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the Donetsk region police said in a statement.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag several Soviet monuments, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to imprisonment.
The residents of Novosibirsk who received prison terms are sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts were granted a 14-month and 18-month prison sentence.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism in relation to monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the KPRF district and on the street of Twisted, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory".
In the latter case, the missile system "Katyush" and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall, on the night of December 12 in the Russian Novosibirsk, the unknowns painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag military equipment at the Monument of Glory.
The civilian wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsiganov Irina Leonova gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are feeling well.
Recently, Gypsies and Leonov broke up.
Yevgeny refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Yevgeny Tzyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow Theatre "Peter Fomenko's Workshop".
He is known for the films "Progulka", "Space as a Premonition", "Brest Fortress", the series "Ottepel" and "Farza".
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsiganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" according to the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened the shooting at the University of the State of Delta left a note with apologies
After the shooting and murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regrets" the first murder and would like to "bring everyone back."
Police in Gothie, Mississippi, say a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, “I killed my wife last night,” and also mentioned that there was a “dog” in the house that “doesn’t touch anyone,” but was probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name it.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to take it all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
University Rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information Monday that Lamb was suggesting a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that "there is no information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was referred to as the "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stin said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and that she was "shoeless."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsey Knowles, whom the newspaper San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb called relatives on Monday at some point to say that "he will not go to prison."
On the evening of the same day, when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a resume posted on the university’s website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their fortune
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life partner, Farra Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reported to have suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is concerned about this, due to which he will not be able to get on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno’s reckless lap in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Show broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated on.
It’s terrible – the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started to play fantastically, and that’s where it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not assigned to the penalty shootout.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote, “Thank you all for your messages, not to describe in words how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers unhappiness with Luke Shaw after defeat in a game with PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to improve to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When any player comes out with such an injury, everyone is very upset by it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," Coku said.
I didn’t have a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a paddle under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
I'm very sorry and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after colliding with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent quickly learns one thing: if your child likes a book, it will take a while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Probably unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question from a company involved in the organization of children's holidays about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Larox" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on SuperCamps' website, and continues, "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be fine except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of a film of the same name shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original storyline.
"In the high-walled town of Allentown in 1991, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see the real tree in the garden," - we read in the text of the description of the love story, not a dream.
If it doesn’t look suspicious enough, Cameron’s text reads almost like a brief outline of the plot of the movie “Laurax”, set out on the Internet Movie Database: “In the high-walled city of Allensville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money – a boy named Ted.
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, by common admission, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the greedy woodcutter and knitser "Nasek" is destroying the environment.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to an artist who had never read a book about Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been obtained from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comment followed.
For Adam Litt there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England national team, but it’s still a difficult question
Winning over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 loss in the Test series that happened last time seems unlikely to me.
I wouldn't rule out a win on my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the rebounders who virtuosoly accept twisted balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring with them the 2012 scars, but only a youthful positive.
With the ball Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt left the England national team on test cricket and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Litt for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
In his seven test matches, he had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that players in cricket are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I’ve said this before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of half-hundreds, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he picks up more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England’s head coach, Trevor Baileys, was good at his mood, even when he didn’t show what he was capable of, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take for a test cricket batsman to leave an impression is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this missed opportunity is already in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman that I highly value.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 in a game against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Mohan next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner while retaining four high-speed bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not opposed to it at all.
I don't see why a batter can't hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be quite what it takes for his county of Worcestershire, but it has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and with my short communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at its approximate statistics — an average of 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among spinners voting “yes” a little, and pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a master move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring to it the richest experience obtained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is involved in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the seta.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's colleague on Darrem Ben Stokes's team is left for a one-day break, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems with this.
Although not everyone agrees with this, the coaches and players who select the players do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The camp of supporters of the UK’s exit from the European Union could win if the economy is in a depression by 2017
David Cameron’s reckless policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without considering choosing the brilliant Jeremy — “Is it yes or no?” — Corbyn the Labour leader or the TUC’s outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat recently explained that while the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises — not all of them self-made — some of the participating countries are fed up with the British egocentric agenda, although it does not sow discord and undermine the fundamental changes that they are in.
Gathering in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that it did not want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the auspices of the European Union - "Don't leave us together with France," says Berlin - proposes that high-ranking ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when it will matter to them whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as she has worsened for the sitting Thatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kol (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses his strength.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them sneaking out to help “selfie Brits” whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland’s exit from the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style straps during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the process of Britain’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "Britain has received nothing valuable from the resumption of negotiations".
Europeans know, to their dismay, what a predator Fleet Street might be, and how skeptical of the EU are the media moguls, unlike the times of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which backed our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an ingrained Euro-opportunist who became famous for his “direct EU bananas” by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse company of fearful tax swindlers, phone hackers-foreigners, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of the same opinion about them, but realized that when you’re in a cage with a bustling gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair gave way to principles in favor of the annulled EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a win.
The press did not forgive him for any of this.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who amicably kicked me on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me — seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock’s ‘80s boycott of Murdoch’ strategy — a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider range of “Little England supporters” among the Tories can probably say “yes” to this.
It’s the same thing Hilary “Benn, but not Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boyscout refusing to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of bearable John McDonnell as “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for disloyalty to colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and not losing his position in the cabinet.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the fight to stay “in any circumstance” — Benn’s phrase — is not what, McDonnell said, nor what J.K. told peers and members of parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, according to the public.
Whatever the Democrat and “my boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to tell me — remember, he even touched me — the discipline of the messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s sensible not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to take Labour’s support for the referendum campaign as proper, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic misconception about EU membership – within the “beninite” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism, born of a slight difference, is a central principle in dogmatic plots.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that J.K. will not be agitating for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey it to their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions, when it can all be meaningless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting spending, as I was reminded Monday during a luncheon at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise Public Health England’s review of e-cigarettes
Statements by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet have criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - a "turning point" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In a BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these statements were “solid or flexible.”
Martin McKee, a lecturer at the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence."
According to them, the public expects PHE’s statements that “the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking” to be based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model for multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to generalize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capeville reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It has also confirmed BAT certificates in the field of health in the Sustainable Development Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not mentioning the funding he was reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of board members has not been provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom have also stated that they are financing the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants of the meeting have management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, “greatly agrees” that there is a lack of “great evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke” were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction.
All the evidence implies that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what these evidences prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion per year.
Having clearly indicated the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only part of the harm caused by smoking – we do our job to the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC company should stop the series EastEnders
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera on Alberta Square.
Johnson noted that the license fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only watched by a small part of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to establish cooperation with the BBC during his six-year tenure on Channel 4.
“I can’t help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could show competing companies not receiving subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s investigation into the future.
If you keep the license fee, which I don’t think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should leave on the air only those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show airs in the prime slot because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to funding broadcasts that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are self-produced.
Other channels would certainly have paid a lot for it.
I don’t understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don’t think that would degrade the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing the ratings "because of the ambitions of the employees and their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support."
His comments on the most popular shows on the BBC are reminiscent of those of Sky CEO Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh offered the BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC broadcasts of a public nature "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the prefaces of the Hong Kong sermons, which justify the revenue from the royalties of all of us are not: "Dafun 4 billion.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also addressed the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise Rita's mission in favor of "informing, educating, and entertaining."
He noted that now only a small part of the BBC's output is formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and share".
Regarding the partnership, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade Concerts" (only some of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with the help of sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction of motion at the moment they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have brought out worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of motion when they are exposed to sound impulses that are too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses are effected by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Next Next post: Researchers control brain activity with the help of light
Scientists have said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics," the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart and muscle cells, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salca Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation – an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and which is used in the treatment of the disease.
Worm nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and excite the cells that are associated with them, a report in Nature Communications reported.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of the worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the organisms of worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this technique, sonogenetics can have some advantages.
Unlike light that is delivered to the right part of the brain by fiber optics, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass unimpeded through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to be delivered inside the skull.
“We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal in time,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements are being teased over British arms trade
Watch a video of Amnesty International protesting against the arms show.
Stunning killer drones!
Destroying ankle iron chandeliers!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise sticks that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
A lively voice and cartoon animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition is a bitter parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons systems to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the technology of Dostoyevsky in the center.
DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes go to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that require you to look at them again.
"An important announcement going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with an image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of the tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will heat up on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy’s Dismalland Park.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London using a “ad-snatcher set,” a 6-pound wrench set that reportedly “provides access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet’s bus stops.”
London transporters are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, the artists are becoming more demanding and strive to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the VCCP agency, working pro bono, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was stunned by the advertising silence around the arms show — with a pass on the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s get them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling it with bright colors and animation was a more exciting occupation."
“They have helped us incredibly to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition comes from inside the ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order for the "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting", which came from the US Army.
It includes “an unparalleled cumulative combat charge that brings unrivalled interceptive action inside the target.”
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved to the student dorm as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the intense smiles of those I irritated — and numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely scary.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you came from, where you took your academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you “honestly, I don’t love, I don’t hate Marmaith,” because, seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract of yourself.
Take a breath.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It supports the conversation and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were distributing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and common party venues, but they’re also the place where people dress and fix their underwear.
Next Next post: Don’t even think about starting college while you’re in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a haven, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendly relationships.
It can be hell for those who are trying to regain their strength.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can restore the energy I’ve spent communicating with you.”
Try to feel when the classmate is tired of communication - and do not knock at him, but send SMS.
By the way, about the knock: do it.
One guy in my dormitory followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He's seen something.
Make friends with the help of baking.
Since you start your university life at the peak of Bake-Off's popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce themselves and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is no longer such a strange act, it's not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I'll give you something."
Offering home-cooked meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Poorly blended lumps of flour, sugar, and fat will more likely make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the appropriation of someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft - to take a little milk for tea?
Take care of the milk owner.
He'll probably suggest that you don't feel embarrassed, even if he's boiling inside in anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you - but try to treat this adult than my neighbor, who poured a dishwashing liquid into her milk to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to lower the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then cut her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Wasn’t it romantic if your future husband settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extraordinary, before biting your elbows, clumsy, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got involved with them, broke up with them, and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you won't order your heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
In that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the play and the mess is thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson in safety by hiding something – but never mess someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone else’s door and drop the keys into a glass of water that you then put in the freezer – but don’t glue someone else’s stuff with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after the release of an update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered issues after the installation, when an error message appears telling them that "The application update failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait for the revival to subside, or try updating through iTunes.
The tips on your phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include deleting apps to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution using a special utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when you update your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as unloading the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad leads only to the escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that further support of President Assad from Russia creates the risk of exacerbation and prolongation of the conflict, and also negatively affects our common goal of fighting extremism, if we do not also continue to focus on the transfer of power to the United States in order to find ways to resolve the Syrian conflict.”
They also noted that Kerry once again underlined the commitment of the United States to fight the “Islamic State” within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the U.S. “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State.”
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will go to the benefit of our interests, then he will raise the bar.
Barack Obama says Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime is a “loser rate.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings - and as a result the situation got worse," he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Russian Government.
This was reported to Izvestia by Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the results of the trip to the Crimea instructed a number of departments - Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Federation, the Russian Federation, the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation to prepare proposals for the creation of good
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for the provision of full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was referred to the Sub-Commission on Customs Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation, Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the departments as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full parole on importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkin explained.

The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that they have prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified port procedure for the registration of the event and the exit of small-sized, sporty sails.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sports sailing and walking vessels into the seaport and the exit of the vessels listed from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the borders of the seaports of the Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of harmonization, - said in the press service of the Ministry.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and inspection, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coastline is uninteresting, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht does not even have anywhere to refuel.
For two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it, - says the director of sales of the company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the places for storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.

In the prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite in the colonies.
About this "Izvestia" told the member of the council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who are not determined by sex, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Gryb emphasizes that it is possible to determine the deportation of citizens to such isolated places only after the convicts have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the criminal is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice operates successfully abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate cameras for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, this is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trances by roommates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with an undetermined sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
There is no need for separate vehicles - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As explained by the Mushroom, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, then inmates of transsexuals will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are kept in the prison at the crime scene, so the receipts of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - believes Mushroom.
Recall, the day before law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which investigative isolator - male or female - to identify the drug-detainee of the 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukova (known as Alina Davis), which is why the man with the girl was not in the hospital.
He was released home on a non-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism of keeping transgender people in SIZO and colonies in Russia really does not yet exist.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for the punishment of transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify people in the colony - male or female.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than there are transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a different colony than usual.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything happens unambiguously.
For example, in the United States, one of the inmates, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison, said that he wanted to change the sex, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel anything at all.
But as long as there are no separate places for the punishment of transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the subtlety of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health on the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of the punishment of convicts.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long observations, it is not one test on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry allows it.
Therefore, before the change of sex, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether the change of sex with surgery is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to the convicts, because on average it takes a month for such an examination.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, a very small number, Lordkipanidze said.
At the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people and so on can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the World Chess Championship among juniors up to 20 years.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to chase the Pole Yan-Kshishtof Duda, who seemed confident to go to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory of the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshistof Duda, who won a series of four victories (competitions are held on the 13th Swiss system).
Considering that Duda was the favorite rating of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the break seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce his deficit to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the title fight.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda's game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to non-binding mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who met with Benjamin Bok, to finish his party.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player defeated the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
That is why it is to him that the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, whose governor Natalya Komarova, traditionally paying great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the competitions of girls an intriguing ending did not happen.
Tournament leader Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag behind the champion in 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.

Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency was against indexing 10% of tariffs on freight and providing state subsidies, as requested by the OJSC RZD.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and then they want multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget,” he says.
We say: it’s wrong, it’s too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much more stringent” proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.

Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or request a surcharge.

Ministry of Commerce: targeted food aid will not be an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtukhov said that the program of targeted food assistance will not be an analogue of the card system of distribution of food that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I would especially like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product cards with the echo of the past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," Mr. Evtukhov said.
Earlier, "U" wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced in the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of top-level Russian managers, the study sums up the results of the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s ranking.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year’s ranking candidate and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the total pool of candidates.
It is possible to appoint the following directors of functional areas of the company: financial director, commercial director, director of marketing, director of personnel, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of relations with authorities, director of corporate management.
Each proposed expert manager is sent an invitation to participate in the ranking and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forest processing industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-disciplinary manufacturing, logistics, professional services, communications and telecom
Each participant is provided with a login and password to login to the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can make their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
At the heart of the methodology for building the rating is the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate the top managers, functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
This principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of expert commissions.
All applicants for the current year’s rating and multiple candidates for the rating of previous years are invited to the informal meetings of expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the commission for the approval of the list of senior managers and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make updating their adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms "<0xD0><0x95>".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market of lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year decreased by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic at the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015 the lending volumes of SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans under 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank could previously put all its possible problems at an increased rate in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do it: rates and so cloudy.
For businesses, the current level of rates on SMEs loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive return on them.
How much do you think the demand of entrepreneurs for loans is satisfied?
After the ECB’s interest rate cut, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow to modernize equipment, reduce the cost of production and energy supply.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a reduction in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not to be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to obtain real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the Central Bank are reduced.
When it comes to the level of overdue, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited in both replenishment options and economic behavior correction options, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, like, however, and any other model of the brand: without eccentricity attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese already simply because of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can give as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person will even agree in principle with these arguments, but the whole conversation will disperse from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but everything else Japanese.
To quote from Base's course, to spice up Wasabi food, to collect katanas and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But the new design of the headlights and taillights, by which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars, changes the appearance of the car much more.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance has a touch of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 hp. The power unit is equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not get behind the wheel of the CX-5 in the place of your own accident.
To further improve comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or stripe is as boring as a budget sedan.
It is different if the girl is shaking in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of a role-playing fighter.
It will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs.
Even the long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in expressions.
Mazda’s widest range of active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to detect a potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There's both adaptive lighting, and lane-down warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - with each section provided with a separate carrying lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kygurumi".
The pyjamas are especially cute.
You can do anything in it!
Of course you sleep.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - funny clothes, behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in the preparation of the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev has torn apart the nuclear union.
Kiev has officially declared the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the development of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday, with a second attempt, still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law rescinding the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The draft law submitted by the government of the country managed only with a second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.
The Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, originally built in the USSR, had to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the extension led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in the relations between the two countries, Kiev began to wind up relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained, was the purchase in the Russian Federation of fuel for the operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the power generation in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" to replace the Russian supplies with nothing.
Plans for the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, talks with the Czech <0xC5><0xA0>koda JS were announced in Kiev.
UN Secretary-General against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," the AP said in response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“The meeting will be in Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of establishing an air base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, "U" reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight against the Russian-prohibited terrorist group "Islamic State".

In the PA OSCE reports about a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “return to normal life activities of our countries.”
Asked whether, in his opinion, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group on the OSCE PA platform - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was conducted, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, all kinds of dialogue are supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city council in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections came from the representatives of the CPRF, who accused the election of "covering counterfeits".
The opposition’s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, he rejected the party "Communists of Russia" in organizing a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the repair of multi-apartment houses.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections to the Nizhny Novgorod Pride in the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voters’ lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued for voting in the sectional commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six seats in the parliament are entrusted to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizavet Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the KPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Fair Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates have to decide whether they will work as deputies in the city council: in the event of a resignation, he moves on to the next party list candidate.
The chairman of the electoral commission, Alexander Makeev, told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty for "the sending of telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" for the purpose of denial of mandates.
When the protocol on the results of the elections was approved, the representatives of the CPRF declared multiple violations.
The member of the electoral committee with the right to consultative vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where there were four districts, was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State of Udma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could go inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the assault of the doors of the rayadministration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head stopped access only when the voting ended and the section commissions had not yet arrived to submit their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"The chapter was then amended, and at all meetings interested parties could be present," said the member of the electoral commission, Natalia Andryushina.
The Communists objected to the fact that in the blocked administration building more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the Zack assembly of the region Ludmila Aristowa, on which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that a number of UICs on election day began sealing the ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m., putting out ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the committees with the right of deliberative vote and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists believe that in the morning before the opening of polling stations, they could throw ballots into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the mountain pick, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the insertion of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of his colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through a glitch to come out with amendments to the regional legislation to clearly set the time for the opening of envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the ballot box.
"On your own initiative, at least contact the CEC," Ms. Popova Aleksandr Makeev advised.
At the end of the meeting, Sergey Samokhin, a member of the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPRF), fell down with loud accusations, shouting that the election ignores dozens of complaints and covers falsifications in the elections.
"You're not at the rally here, so be careful!" the president of the election committee was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election must approve the general election results, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city electoral commission refused to register the political party "Communists of Russia" with the initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: do they agree that the fees for the upgrading of multi-apartment houses should be "immediately abolished" and the tariffs for housing and utilities "frozen until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the appeal of the “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx’s revenue is mixed, with forecasts for 2016 falling.
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant lowered its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent at the preliminary trades 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite an average rate hike of 4.9 percent, which will take effect on January 4, and an increase in land-based heavy or bulk freight charges, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to see revenue growth compared to last year due to lower spending, higher gross income and increased online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “has been operating steadily in light of weak, compared to forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
The holiday workforce plans were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transportation sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transportation division.
However, the online shopping boom has dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained unchanged overall due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transport unit received higher incomes due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, incomes fell due to higher payroll costs.
At the preliminary trades about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, Federal Reserve chiefs will spend two days this week behind a 27-foot redwood table, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of a richly decorated meeting room two stories high above them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third injunction may prove to be an unknown factor in a near-predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows strong economic growth, recent shocks in the world’s financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what they will do in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of economists, recently polled by Bloomberg, predicted interest rate growth this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to stay away from this, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid rise.
This could cause the stock market to fall if the federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow with the promise that the next raise will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The takeoff was triggered by expectations that the people who determine the federal system’s strategy will leave the stakes this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
“It would be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the Federal Reserve’s leadership does so, “they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that raising the rate could calm the financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System appeared to be leaning towards raising the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects higher rates this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in more than seven years, and almost at what the federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s target of 2% per annum, the Federal System’s leadership said the key cause was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones index for industrial companies fell by as much as 16% to a record high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partly recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the Federal Reserve’s management, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations of the interest rate increase period.
“In the absence of information about what has happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to spin the nuts at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty about what the consequences may be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve System has become the world’s financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “suppress” its monetary expansion has caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, Federal Reserve leaders could be expected not only to monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more of an art than a science,” said Zakari Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a global asset management company.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been instances of overreaction to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles.”
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, which insisted on raising rates, cited the 1998-99 rulings as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identifiable consequences for U.S. growth,” Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The latest panic has not come close to that level, he said.
“You wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re afraid of rising rates because markets are going through a shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.

Although there can be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma speaker Sergey Naryshkin admits that the United States intentionally destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question is asking itself: is it not Europe that is the ultimate target of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?” he asked.
“Someone probably assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people, who are saving themselves from death, will flow into the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Did many European political leaders speak out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally engulfing their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially watched and is watching how the military boot, sewn up by NATO standards, is also shattering moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” he said.
Government troops and their loyal paramilitary formations are opposed by rebels, mainly composed of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. supports insurgents who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Damascus considers such insurgents to be terrorists.
The president of Syria called the reason for the West's hostility to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and replace him with another, who would act in the interests of the Western countries, rather than in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp upheaval of the Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power undemocratically, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s persistent claims that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves – at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, or else he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation with them is being carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about the military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of people killed exceeded 230,000, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is launching air strikes on IS positions.
In Utah, 12 people died from the flood.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, during the conversation with Kerry, Lavrov once again emphasized the need to create a united front to fight terrorist groups operating on the territory of this country.
Ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern over Moscow’s increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not be in international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The international coalition led by the United States is subjecting the positions of ISIS to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper defamation on Strelkov.
Former head of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
A note in the Washington Post is wonderful because everything is completely twisted there.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "exited" him from the territory of the Donbass republics in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three fours of money, which are attributed to him by different characters.
According to Borodai, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "connected".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left himself," Borodai noted.
"It's defamation to me and to Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post there was an article that quoted the words of Borodai about the fact that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to bind his colleague.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish lumberjacks began cutting down trees above an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to check the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to shut down the search area.
Three days earlier, Deputy Polish Minister of Culture Petro Zhukovsky said that local treasure hunters with a "99 percent probability" found the same train with the Third Reich gold, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhi with the message that they found a train in a muddy tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco up to 21 years.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly harmful".
So he said live on the radio station "Speaks Moscow", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of a ban on the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A person matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by age 21," said Brun.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Sober Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the platform of the upper floors."
According to the activist, the Federation Council will soon establish a working group to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Children’s Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development", the Sib.fm correspondent read the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the “Read City” store on Red Prospect.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violated FZ "On protecting children from information that is harmful to their health and development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor’s Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the address of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Syb.fm.
In addition, this is a very serious problem that will rip society apart.
It will begin to re-read the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Pediatrics Union of Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves a demonstration of images of infants sucking breasts painted with images of harmful food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children get all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and pregnant women are recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one calorie increase is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of an unhealthy diet on the child’s immune system has been identified.
A school bus crashed into a train near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, a collision occurred in their eyes.
The video was taken by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation, there was panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked to this day.
According to police, no one was injured by a miracle, except one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, the 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a cerebral trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life-saving device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22, suffered only two defeats, and one fight ended in defeat.
He has two children left.
This is the second death toll among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, from her point of view, to ban it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Stephen Pernis, the organization’s vice president.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergey Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma spokesman Sergey Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
He said this at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We see this as an unacceptable act, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," he said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let’s bring morality back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanist ideals to a democratic world order.
“Doubleness has never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the stand of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First of all, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our interparliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be honoured.
“This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” he said.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to win the team championship of Europe, set several records, and the main thing - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Brilliant League", taking the third place in the overall ranking.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will already think about rest.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It’s easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season have boiled off, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, in "relaxation".
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming soon...
Are you tired?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness at the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what you do, win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, relocations - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
My emotions are on the rise, of course.
I'm just happy!
By the time you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that the bad athlete who lives on the old victories, scrolls his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we have to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can't say there was anything special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the meetings, then back home.
Just as usual.
But with the coach, the goal was to try to get to a new level that I haven’t been to yet.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran into a bunch of crosses, did exercises on general physical training, which included both pull, and squat, and the back we pumped.
Then they took on the barrier training, engaged in a lot of technology.
Did you watch your opponents?
I always try to do this, the good in the age of the Internet with this there is no problem.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was taken by the French!
I also thought: something needs to be done, to dilute this company.
With every start this season, you’ve added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I have all the last seasons in roughly the same scheme.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 first, and then 13.50.
I always turn my shape up gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your readiness does not always turn out.
What was it like at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not make it to the final. - "We") tried to forget immediately.
It was very good, I could really get out of 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at the time, he would become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But you're not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What do you mean?
It was in the tag.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program maximum.
And he dropped right from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and breaking my head means not going anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he came out in the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win "gold" already then!
How is it possible, developing a decent speed, not to lose even the head, not to turn off?
But that's the hardest part.
It is necessary to be very careful, focused on the technique in order not to break down barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is so much easier.
And the most important thing is when you have the feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the deep after their first major successes are looking to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's still better at home.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, I've been in athletics.
Or rather, at first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she already passed me on.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped long, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when throwing a ball, jumping in length from the place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to meet the norms of the second adult level.
That's the way it is.
Has there ever been a fear of barriers?
We were able to negotiate with them right away.
There has always been a lot of work to do with technology.
How much he suffered over one hurdle!
But this routine doesn’t go anywhere.
The technique has to be sharpened constantly - in order to wake me up at night, I immediately got up and would run through barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful race.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually revise my runs, and I couldn't stay here.
But we need to work on efficiency – there are no limits to perfection.
Aren’t you afraid that a year before the Olympic Games, the victory will be on your shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you’re not weak, you shouldn’t feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I’m not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed their bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't wave a flag, and I've said the same thing a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard, I was hit by something else.
All my pseudo-friends snapped, evaporated somewhere in a second.
The pressure that I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, who've published the types of guys, think people are bleached.
It's like walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a mob, and you're mutinying with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit you with a howitzer, I'm old, you guys, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so have a bite.
And giving passports to creeps like Fred Durst or Monson can only be bullshit.
For me, the best journalist, it would be a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili abruptly characterized the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something does not fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to your neighbor's house and picking up his living space.
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with the call of some asshole from the Kremlin’s prison.
I have guesses who that might have been...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live on.
I don’t understand why he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to his small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh Leads in Ranking Despite Ninth Attempts to Lighten Loss Leaders on Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to shed light on the consequences of the Liberal Party’s statement to liberate the leader’s place could not greatly raise the Today rating.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Competitor Sunrise, with lead singers David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture seems to have made little difference to Australian viewers, despite the Sunrise audience having 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today’s audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher compared to its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 at Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are influencing more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

Important news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have debated whether Thomson can handle the popular show on his own, without the star of Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a loud "yes" answer.
The X Factor 7 remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily circumventing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television quiz, led by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McVier (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour - an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of the ratings of Chase Australia on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to overtake MacGyver's show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellowe, Sarah McCain and Snowy Marcoskey may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win in the "Holostiac".
The woman, with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in The Holodeck, is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And the three girls who came to the final, of course, keep silent about who exactly got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McCay, Snowy Marcos and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to remain, they might have unexpectedly given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his silence until the final, which will be held on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could inadvertently suggest which of them actually won the heart of Holostjak.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy (Sara) and Sam’s energy and I realized that they were very close to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubts about that,” she said.
“Sara is a very open person, easy and fun with her,” added Marcoski.
I saw them together, there really is attraction between them.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay believes that she and Sam Wood will be a great couple.
McKay herself said that due to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
To the question of who should choose Voodoo, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show is out on Wednesdays at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jarred Hein had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the U.S. – as were many other clubs that sent inquiries after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hein on the reserve bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first comeback of the pant in a winning game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Haine another chance to get his pants back, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself from the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of distributing to newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by the team of Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
Heine and his many Australian fans clearly did not count on such a debut in the NHL.
It was apparent that Hayne was bragging about leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the host of the show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to a career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and all," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a throw of the ball in his catch zone brought a try to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a photo on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of using weapons at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
There have been clashes between migrants and police on the Hungarian border.
The refugees staged protests at the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which have grown into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to demolish the fence at the border.
The scene of the clashes is being reinforced and police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to breach the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country have allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for examining asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, so he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian parliament is also planning to consider the transfer to the Hungarian armed forces of functions for the protection of the border of the country.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire fence 175 km long on the border with Serbia to deter the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in U.S. history.
The accused in the largest cyber attack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During a trial in New Jersey state court, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the collusion with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a $1 million fine.
When issuing the sentence, the court will take into account the confession of the Russian and may reduce his term.
Drinkman's conviction will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia’s support of the Bashar al-Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks aggravating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the statement said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (the activities of which are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be able to be a reliable member" of the coalition.
During the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel on the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country’s proposed new constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before launching rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesi people say that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting at 10 a.m.
In August, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, it was a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands in April.
Legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects he told the correspondent "Regional".
Oleg Valeryevich, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of the audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of local budget funds.
An audit of the municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the turnover of documents to five days.
Previously, the papers on the instances could have been for months.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize expenditures.
In November last year, a government meeting was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
In the city there was no project-calculation documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the road, kindergarten, northern sewerage collector and plumbing.
Road works are already underway in two areas.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Saiyansk.
Such a positive demographic has not been observed in the city in the last 27 years.
So the issue of securing places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
Since September 1, it has been closed for major repairs of kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair - 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, the kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program was also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children from the age of one and a half to three years.
There are no queues for children between the ages of three and seven.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, Saiyan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphaned children in the Leningradsky microdistrict is put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which entered the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square meters of housing for those wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes the finishing "turnkey".
If we manage the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for the investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Saiyan Pig Complex was built on the territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional property is resolved, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Saiyansk?
We have concluded about 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Substantial support is provided by such enterprises as ZAO "Vostok-Centre", Novo-Ziminskaya TPP, LLC "Sayansky Broiler", LLC "PC MDF", the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the city LLC "Sayansky broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of the equestrian yard, where specialists deal with children hypotherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the urban ZAGS.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the City Day colorfully.
As in the good old days, there was a parade with the participation of urban collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
Jubilee medals were awarded to the first builders and people who made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk.
The patrons are also involved in the work of the City Charitable Foundation.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800,000 rubles have been allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are personal problems in the social sphere solved in Saiyansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teacher-subjects in the city.
In order to solve the personnel issue, the provision of housing for specialists is of great importance.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received work housing.
We have a program to allocate housing with the ability to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to redevelop the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on indexation of social pensions in view of the increase in prices.
The State Duma has introduced a bill that provides for indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is made annually from April 1, taking into account the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexing is postponed to February 1, and the second is carried out on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini that it was inadmissible to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA speaker Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against legislators participating in the events of the assembly were inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected in support of Canerva’s position.
"A strong enough support has already been formed," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting the signatures of deputies, which indicated the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, said Kovalev, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the EU's governing bodies and "send an appropriate petition".
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of Cape Verde is 60 percent.
The wide front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area roughly in the middle between the Green Cape Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami synoptics reported.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a doubling campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping trapped European countries refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google collaborator Rita Masoud, who was fleeing Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We got on questionable trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, triggered for the most part by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics With Little Obesity May Help With Obesity Surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with mild obesity suffering from type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with small obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics don’t show up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in a column by the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to assimilate food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at values from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about level 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were fully cured of diabetes, and in part - 28%.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed in only 1%, and a partial one in only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors state.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the mean level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control scores, reflected by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality levels in five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the arm gastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%), and was also closer to full remission (46.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment does indeed lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone from Blackstone College of Medicine in Fawkes.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with BMIs below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
"Here the report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in a low-BMI group where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI falls in the range of 27 to 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytyshchy, the robbers took out of the house coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytyshchy, the robbers attacked the residents of the suburban house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats from them.
Interfax informs about this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons entered the house, located on Gorky Street, bound the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under the article "Theft" was initiated.

Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get a permit.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the World Cup, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt's interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting detachable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for detachable housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopolies.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies were deceiving citizens by placing a certain number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now literally every number, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all the hotels in St. Petersburg.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy of the committee for the development of tourism Nano Gwichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many inspections were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny on the amazing coincidence of circumstances is unknown.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification," the director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya, acknowledged.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers make the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets in which no expenses for inspections have been set, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still, in recent times, hotel managers have intensified and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels need to have until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star rating, a fixed fee will be developed for the hotel room at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to prevent a price rise of 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow an increase of two or three times, but also to give hotels to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don’t know how much this fits within the economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than a relentless hike," he said.
It is not clear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma introduced a bill, according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not affect St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Gwaciya.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and at the moment there are 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a gap in the direction of hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation in which "75,000 vipers sit in the 80,000-seat stadium".
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban is considered "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but the visitors for some reason can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel, where guests come for a short time, why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk of missing out on the World Cup because of their irresponsibility.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the pit digs itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordered.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that travel," - noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the results of the checks are more significant.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is due, among other things, to constant relocations in the government’s tourist block, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, you will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
On the example of celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in the cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive prepared on vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
“The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will be empty later,” Gennady Lamshin is sure.
It will also be very popular during the football championship to use removable housing.
Most likely, in the city will create a reserve of removable apartments.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first to leave the housing near the stadium," - said the specialist on rental Agency of development and research in real estate Larissa Bragin.
And the rental price may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only suggest the way, but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the courtyard - a father, a mother and two children.
They found nowhere to sleep: with hotels it was difficult then, it was difficult to sleep at the train station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that now there is no such feature in the inhabitants of the city - calling home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But perhaps in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "smelted" the Amur region.
Today I watched with admiration the clown of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did things like this when our generation was just learning how to trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech was “the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; other protocols than those signed by the electoral commissioners, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he raises the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the elections!"
And right now, there's nothing going on with Rodnin, and then, after firing already with the chairman, he takes the faction out of the meeting room, literally shouting, "You're all with the fronts of your thieves and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes not Abramov, but the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another departure of Zhirinovsky in the style of “Podonki!”, and not at all a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party’s website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the topic is obviously coming down.
Allows the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, and himself proclaims against “United Russia” in general and in no way guilty of the Family.
An elegant solution not to lose a face, and in a real, not a showy scandal not to go.
Another thing that is now in a strange position is Abramov himself.
Apart from the cries of the superiors, he did not expect anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for the narrow circle it has become a formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even more so, the hamstring attacks against the ER and the ONF.
And then, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the No. 2 policy of the region and the No. 1 candidate to the only regional single-member district, it can turn into a pariah, which successfully used its own party leadership and super-stimulus for the same ONF and the party leadership of a stranger.
Certainly - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should come up with and respectfully observe him.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom didn’t fall at all.
Only the subject of Abramov was buried.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries that are the homeland of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics research, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that under the existing circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while this is admirable, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the harsh U.S. response triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children swallowing hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children under 12 years of age swallowing hand sanitizing fluids reported to the toxicology centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percent of them are sent to the ambulance,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink a disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or a social media controversy.
The videos on Youtube show how teenagers drink disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
The teens reportedly mixed a disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can attract pleasant smells of disinfecting liquid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (desinfecting hand fluids) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
The hand sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D., Ph.D.D., Ph.D.D.D.D.D.D.D., Ph.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.
You wouldn’t just leave a whiskey room, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a large amount of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand sanitizer with a strawberry flavor in about four sprays at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at a Gwinnett medical center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children’s clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Naiji’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand disinfectant liquids from the children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York conspired to poison their “opposite” teacher by “spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has banned keeping them in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was “empty conversations” and address issues of discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya, a cast iron owl mourns.
Babies who come for books try to feed her candy.
It has been in the library for 95 years for several generations.
The very first readers in the twentieth years of the last century arranged loud readings here, put plays on the poems of Mayakovsky, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalinets wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinova Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her childhood photo to distant friends of Barnaul.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna would like to be given her name to the library, she wrote that she did not.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain who this harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the building of the library.
In the years of reconstruction, different people often called, angry: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path made of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and was distinguished from all other managers only by her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the internet: "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer".
Olya made the illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers from all over the world and composes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space.
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - says the director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - children come here!
I think interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers are posted, who go to the library with the whole family: mother, father and children.
The library is happy that the popes are coming with the children more and more often.
If at the age of two the child was read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more difficult.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old child from publishing 12+ books.
To receive such a book, the child must bring with him the parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of bibles with hymns and eras, the story of Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining "Murzilka" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of the book", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint together.
We made a play area for the kids - the child just comes to play, and the hand still reaches out to the book!
Some of our readers are abducted by their parents, and they stand with their feet, do not want to leave.
Often moms come with strollers - and we are glad that the library they put in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with babies.
Tatyana Kushvid says: Modern children, just as we once did, love classical children’s literature:
“The publishing business is developing, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors who are the link between the generations.”
And when it comes to young children, it’s important for them to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don’t like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, what books should pay attention and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, to the bookstore.
The steps will squeak under your feet - it's already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet like with an old comrade: hello, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie is still walking along the road, plastered with yellow brick, Tolya Ryzhykov's tape steals magic matches, and Boy-Kibbalchish never said to the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - he has a firm word.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can know your own anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of bibles with hyacinths and eras.
Or tell Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or a 1936 "Murzilki" lining.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in tea color.
These books are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I'm all about to retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the children will not behave on it, so to speak: and the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, komsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - says "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasova, the manager of the bookstore.
The pages of the "Murzylik" have darkened since time immemorial.
Galina Vasilyevna manages a bookstore all her life.
She knows what color the caps are at Buratino, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the quidditch championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motorbike, and who Alice Selezneva's father works for.
The librarian’s work is paid little, and everyone who can live without these book ranks finds a different profession very quickly.
There are only the most convinced: educators, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiles at you at the first minute of the conversation, he’s a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian, I like that they are exactly and beautifully placed on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them so much, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope the books will always be there, despite the riders.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There is no disagreement in Celtic
Griffiths refuted Celtic's disagreement after Dale admitted that Hoops was in a bad position, but he will fix it.
The Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nilsson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons have increased the advantage over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's penalties in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, allowing Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denies talks about disagreements
This sparked rumours of disagreements at Celtic, which were cut short by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates are not suffering from any intensified criticism as they prepare for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
“I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots do not fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, now the representative of Ajax, said: "The most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
“I’m going to change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dayla admitted that Celtic were struggling, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
After the defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 players to Aberdeen, which now, having broken by five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, “Seltic had bad periods before, and we’ll be out again.”
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players a lot better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warberton is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the team's unity.
A former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Mitch, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted he could leave football after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from ankle problems for two years and could not leave Wales this summer.
The charts are going to oppose the SFA over the statements of Nelson
The charts went 2-1 when Patterson was removed and started to lose 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this was the third Collum red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson said: “I have not questioned ethics, I have not commented on the game.”
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyncasle
The stubborn player of the team "Heibernian" got an excuse after admitting that he sang the song with insulting words about the former "Harts" player Rudy Skacela.
The incident took place at a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn area before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tyncasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was hot," the striker said, adding, "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to go back to Tyncasle if he doesn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis board is confident in the management of Dandy United
Simon Donnelly argues that Dandy United’s board of directors remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the worsening situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to go out again,” Donnelly said.
McKinney is happy to have won the "unbeautiful" Hamilton
Derek McKinness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assis to achieve a seventh consecutive victory in the league championship, which put them five points above Celtic, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to the penalty of Adam Rouney.
McInnes said: “There is no team here that has won anything – the cup or the league championship – that has not won the match in a similar way.”
Unemployment among the Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 for the period from May to July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell for the quarter to 74.0%, which is higher than the average figure of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scotland’s Minister of Affairs David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a member of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the labour market situation in Scotland as employment increases and unemployment declines.
Why I'm a Witness to the Oklahoma Execution
Today, evading legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the death cell surveillance gallery at Oklahoma State Jail when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who want more than places often decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after several months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I am not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving in to my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better” herself, but still believes I’m wrong about what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip did not agree with anything I said or wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he said it.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of accomplice to the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death sentence was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to talk to about it.
From me you will learn what it's like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
Police Persecuted Man Convinced to Get Out of the Canning River
The constable from the town of Canning-Val managed to persuade the man to get out of the river Canning, and himself to stay dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water on shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to go ashore".
Canning-Vail police were summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing to Cunning.
But he didn't go far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not going out, come on, grab me,’” Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Laclan Perhavets did not want to urinate, so he used a safer approach - "negotiating with a good policeman".
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Kasins remembers that.
In 2006, Casey moved to the hut to avoid a meeting with a police patrol for an alcohol check, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but prompted locals to invent the funny "Ben Casins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of espionage and threatens to quit equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the equestrian sport immediately.
His target was stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tata's launch due to a violation of the rules of drug use on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always puts all his efforts into racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lidari test on cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He has been holding his tongue over suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like a green grape.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been tolerating it for a long time, but sometimes it knocks you off the track so much that you’re no longer holding back,” Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to experience the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head raised and I want my owners to know that I am doing my best for them.
When they start to think it’s not so, then I’m going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man I’ll call if asked and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I’m doing in my own stable,” Moody said.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all, without a doubt, make statements, because the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rolston, RVL’s former chairman, David Moody, RVL’s current chairman, and Bernard Sondry, RVL’s senior executive, knew this all along and know it now.
Shouldn’t that make me think that it’s personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to call for accountability for what’s going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and put responsibility on them to make a decision.
I have support from my family and I can leave.
The coach’s annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the latest removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could “throw his license on the table.”
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse's legs were compressed from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the racing rules.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly compressed her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver, who made the raid and escaped from the scene of the incident in Cobra, was arrested
Police arrested a man who shot down a motorcyclist in Cobram on the weekend and escaped from the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was shot down by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
"Melbourne Storm" coach Craig Bellamy pairs the accusations of rivals in the use of harsh force techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception of the ball as "imposing an agenda" on the part of two NRL champions.
Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson said the judges had allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during Storm's sudden victory in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at "Storm" after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the "Nuss Queensland Cowboys" on Saturday evening, when he called this game a "typical" rugby league game, and stated that
Bellamy defended intercepting the ball with his team and stated that they were simply focused on “contact” by intercepting the ball.
Bellami added that he was confident in the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are worried about the possible defeat of Storm.
“It keeps popping up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about the rigors when they beat us 24:2,” Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything for a whole year in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s clearly coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and it’s been a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George's Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was,” he said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style — not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and the Rusters were more points-competitive than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this impressive football?
Or consider it impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
The Storm at the end of this week's weekend, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Crownella Sharks on the following Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday.
The accused in the storage of drugs Serb released on bail of 200,000 dollars
A man who is facing life imprisonment for trying to apportion 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that left South America via Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
During the morning Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the dock, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich is facing a life sentence for trying to appropriate drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole batch, and that the man could be in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should be released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal trial, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and uncle were offered a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It is clear from the testimony of both of them that the $200,000 bail amount is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But one of these measures is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, be reported to the police every day and observe a commanding hour from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the team of Greece, which fought to the last seconds".
Greece's head coach, Fotis Kacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 EuroBasket 2015 final match with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by certain mistakes.
“It was a big game,” Katsikarisa told AFP.
We were preparing for a great game in the performance of the Spaniards.
We tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA I will be assigned the functions of Kaunas."
CSKA novice Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the armies.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Frilanda. - In fact, I will be assigned the functions of Sasha Kaunas, who left the team with the zone, that is, in the defensive buildings, and in the defense.
Yes, it will take me some time to adjust to the center position, but in the NBA I played more forward.
Now we will have to face more of the big center rival, but I've done this before, so I think I can do it now.
The Germans won the Euroleague for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the Final Four six times, but each time they could not show their best basketball.
It is believed that the team has been beaten.
This is the whole game, you can't win forever.
"Of course, it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with Roma will be special."
The head coach of "Barcelona" Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Rome" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face match of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Louis Enrique trained the wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself from the best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience. - quotes the official UEFA website of the words of Luis Enrique. -
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
It’s a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has different options for attacking actions.
Acting head coach of the Ural Vadim Skripchenko in the run-up to the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.
According to the mentor, "bulls" have in their arsenal several models of the game in attack.
The match will take place on September 21 and will begin at 4.30 pm Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see - says the official site "Ural" of the word Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options of attacking actions, conducts its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time, and we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting the Europa League match against Dortmund’s Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana's house can take away anyone's glasses."
Astana midfielder Roher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to Hawbeck, the Astanas are able to pick up points from any opponent on their field.
Despite the fact that the match proved difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - says the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We did not have a bit of courage in the attack.
"Benfica is higher than the class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to take their points.
It's very real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
In the home games, we can pick up the points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I repeat as many times as possible: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the big victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, according to Benitez’s official UEFA website.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide the danger.
“I’m not saying Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of goals.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it as many times as I can.
Giorgio Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi"
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one will be able to compare with his teammate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, the forward of "Real" Cristiano Ronaldo can not do this either.
Messi is five goals ahead of the rest, Le Figaro quotes Albu. - What Leo can do, no one can.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: “Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group tournament match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Recall that "SE" will carry out its text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special competitor, a good team with great players," UEFA's official website De Rossi said.
With blue grenades it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To leave them, we will have to graze throughout the game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wiring, so we need to keep it compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to come out in the starting line-up of the SKA in a match with "Slovan".
Goalkeeper SKA Ilya Ezhov stressed that he hopes to come in the starting line-up of the armies in the next match of the KHL championship.
Ezhov went on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next match the team will hold at the departure against "Slovan".
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up, - says "R-Sport" the words of Ezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we don't show repetitions of missed heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the restoration of the finalist Roland Garros-2015 is not yet known.
We will also remind that on Monday Shafarzhova climbed to one line in the WTA ranking and is now the fifth rocket in the world.
Stephen Hogg used a girl’s phone to force pedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to interrogate images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with the online messaging service, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, after which she immediately drew her mother’s attention to it.
Police arrived and saw five images, after which they searched the computers found at that address, and found “corresponding” queries in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police that he did it because it could “incite pedophiles” and then he would “pretend he was a policeman to scare them.”
Authorized bailiff Eilid Robertson told the sheriff’s court in Dundee: “He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about having a conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and asking him to send more photos.
He said he was doing this to lure them.
He said he had a headache when he drank, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent images on the phone, and then a face-to-face bet was made with the accused.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused used the computer and "Placestone" to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating bail terms on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defendant Gregor Sim’s lawyer requested that Hogg not be included in the list of sexual offenders because there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, until he received a statement from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail on this case, but he was taken into custody before the start of hearings on other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of persons who committed sexual offences before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is reading the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest head of state, fell off the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opposition members that they had received anonymous threats warning them against vilifying Mugabe at the time of the appeal.
A month ago, they whistled at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned noted members of parliament that inviolability ends in the parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two publicly traded companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service industries.
Withdrawals as a result of the expected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will head the organization after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As an individual company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering previously unattainable integrated technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
The company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Paccard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the US, is the latest event in the industry, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing against Dynamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it is only September, and that provided that Wilshire's recovery goes as planned, nothing will stop him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The saddest thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully alive bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or the injuries he has had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as Wenger has also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If we look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, we can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs in the Premier League, on account of which the most missed due to injury days.
Wenger admits the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you get back on track after an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while — during that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do it.
“I hope he recovers physically, I’m sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games with Chelsea and the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Hector Belerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debussy and Arteta will play in the starting line-up.
Wenger may also be introducing Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Girou instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are an absolute favourite in Group F, the stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a force of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season, when the team suffered a defeat in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with little hope to lead the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men’s need for openness has become, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and it happens to men three times more often than women.
In an attempt to address the “Campaign Against Unhappy Lives” issue, she declared 2015 the Year of Men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large enough number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of healing doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chances of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an age when communications are managed by social networks, when style is preferred to content, responsiveness is often valued more than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if loneliness reigns in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values – money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noted, you can’t buy more happiness for money.
The advantage of friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humour and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s sighs on Rachel – all come from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of Samaritans told me, “...my role as a listener for people who are feeling depressed and suicidal, highlights how even the slightest communication of friends can be beneficial.”
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "living with it" is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-lasting overcoming mechanisms.
It emphasized the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of a stranger talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, and long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends to have a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can’t predict in advance what the benefits of friendship will be.
The Friends series is shown on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 series, by the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scoring a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matthewy and Edinson Kavanaugh, celebrates the goals scored at the Malmö goal.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, which allowed PSG to easily circumvent Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's a game report and a game reaction.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their thing when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Park de Prense stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player began to set the course for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavanaugh scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not to qualify for the playoffs, but to continue a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in the game against the team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, deliver problems to the opponents and play well in defense is a good start, even if there are other points that we will need to refine during the season," he said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the replacements in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2:2 in a match with Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player able to take the PSG to a new level in Europe, after he was bought out last month from Manchester United, and he proved why when he ran for the pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Yomyo and beautifully finished the attack.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two midfielders, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicolas Giurgiu’s hit, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp’s long-range goalpost in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
At times, however, PSG was deceiving itself with ineffectual transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not make at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball, which Kavanaugh struck immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he showed himself to be much more skilled in precise passes, and this was a pass from Ibrahimovic, having received which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted punch, which passed the goal to the bar past Wieland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after Ibrahimovic adjusted the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only intercepting the ball by Willand at close range did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before replacing Esquel Lavessi with a goal in the final.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and that is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Share Sale
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, which has been hit by a drop in commodity prices, has earned $2.5 billion in stock sales as part of its grandiose debt reduction plan.
The London-listed company Glencore said it had sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion in order to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is trying to cope with a collapse in commodity prices while China’s downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a preferential price, the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange rose at early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which traded 0.69 percent higher at the time of opening.
Last week, Glencore began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of its extensive plans to reduce its 30-billion-dollar debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 cents apiece, that is, with a discount of 2.4 percent on the price at the close of trading on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 percent of the company’s share capital.
Concerns over the continuation of the downturn in the Chinese economy led to the price of iron ore falling by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
The visit, Xi Jinping’s first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also welcome Xi Jinping and his wife, Pen Liyuan, at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will allow U.S. and Chinese presidents to approach controversial issues constructively,” the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle for a meeting with the leaders of several leading U.S. technology companies en route to Washington, D.C., and then head to New York to attend the September UN General Assembly.
It is expected that Obama and Xi Jinping will discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber-espionage and China’s growing unequivocality about the South China Sea’s disputed waters.

The BMW car, which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the opposite lane and hit the motorcyclist standing on the side.
From the injuries received, a man born in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and before the accident went to the opposite lane.

More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in municipal institutions of the region.
In particular, funds are directed to purchase a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdinsky district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazansky district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
There will be repairs of hot and cold water supply networks, drainage, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, will bring in order the facades of the building, repair the premises, implement a complex of measures on fire safety and energy conservation.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation, headed by the Governor, will take part.
The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shugl, who was a member of the official delegation, talks about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links between the two states.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will participate in the plenary meeting.
Within the framework of plenary and section meetings, we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I believe that this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of specialized ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates participated in his work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also indicated by the fact that a permanent seminar was held at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the Tyumen Region APC visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, it was about cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trade house "Belshina" and options for the prevention of losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about further supplies of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of JSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched on the preparation of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the conclusion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to go to a new level.
These issues also concern the regional centre.
During the meeting with the head of administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moore we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already “breathing on the cod”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will work on gaseous, environmentally friendly fuels.
Another aspect: Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products JSC "Mogielevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, was held, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurala was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a hub for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to solve many problems directly and quickly, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the abyss, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnicity should not be taken into account.
During Sunday’s release of Project Greenlight on HBO, the well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the screenplay chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not the show,” Damon said.
Incredulous Brown, not believing her ears, annoyedly shouted "Oh! Nothing to herself. Well-well" all the time, while the actor from "Marsianina" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the Harmony image they are going to stick to," Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was vehemently opposed, saying that "in the end, we can get what we want wrong."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments directed at Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni commented on the video: “Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is SO WHITE, it hurts.”
Twitter has garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s statements appear just when the literate coverage of the racial issue in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News collaborator Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether this group will be considered a group of haters.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" Awarded First Champion
Professional rock climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the $1 million prize.
On this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two players, Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing a rope 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and settled at a set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior to pass the exhausting stage 4, but Caldero managed the task three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory, which came with incredible hard work, Caldero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"To think about it is incredible, I have never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E!'s reporters.
And all of a sudden this... I never even imagined what it was like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wood met with reporters at The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to walk the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
“If there are more than one finishers, the fastest player gets the prize,” Wood said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing thing, it still gets a lot of satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended about it.
He was happy with what he did.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, “If I’m destined to lose someone, I’m glad it’s Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with its eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
"Detroit Tigers" quietly bypassing "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now take last place in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers brilliantly won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with a 5-4 result at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut the half-game back from the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs in terms of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, albeit for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which eluded them most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they come out,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "The Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three innings.
It was only his third qualitative start in nine outings.
“I just want to end the year with good performance,” Simon said.
“Pitchers can’t throw in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Designated striker "Tigers" Victor Martinez managed to strike three strikes and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He did a good job with the beat,” Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (the quality of the batter), noticeably better in the work of the beat and kept this quality for the game.
Having scored three shots in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
Central host Byron Baxton opened the innings double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, having made a band, took the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strike-out on a sprint from Simon before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player on the road, before newly appointed striker Miguel Sano, who knocked out the two-time "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of earlys not in the car and a comparative wound on the second base Verhagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to a double-play.
It was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff knocked out the ball for a double-play.
After Detroit added an undercover injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned an RBI "double" into the space between the outfielders against closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily untrained Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three innings in the first two innings against the well-deserved pitcher, who was on the injured list before the game itself, having been absent for more than a month due to inflammation of the lower back.
"Definitely not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable and was able to make some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second-baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walk under two outs of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners in an effective position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos then made a "single", bringing another injury, but Victor Martines was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus the threat was eliminated.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a one-point double from catcher James McCann and a two-point single from central striker Anthony Goose, and that was 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in the unearthed third inning, after which he was replaced by the right-handed relayer A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three hits on six hits and a wok with four strikeouts.
Remarks: Right-handed Tigers pitcher Anibal Sanchez has left the players due to a stretch of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had surgery on Sanchez’s shoulder back in 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, it is planned to start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, left-wing pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-back David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to a squat muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play right-hander Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Pray to God" was submitted to the South Sakhalin court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the city council.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the trial participants.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to verify the state for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko’s decision to recognize the book as “extremist material.”
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk prosecutor’s office received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they have asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhray said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called the quotations from the Qur'an - "To You we worship and to You we ask for help", "Do not call on anyone besides Allah".
Kadyrov called the decision-makers on the book "Satans and provocateurs."
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma must pass a law, according to which it is forbidden to take decisions in court directly concerning the texts of the Koran and other divine scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees.
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism on the network, Facebook’s leadership intends to work together with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the head of the department Haiko Maas said that at the moment, the Ministry of Justice, together with the specialists of the social network, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and delete inaccurate comments regarding migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network about abusive posts should also contribute to the operational blocking of illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements about migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after a sharp rise in xenophobic sentiment in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis of its magnitude, which covered the countries of the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the points for the placement of refugees are already crowded.
The day before, the authorities of the country decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries will appear areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinsk cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at Troekurovsky Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small green areas, reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors of cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovo, Butovsk and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests as much as possible.
The green areas will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and the squares allocated directly to the burial sites.
The experts of GBU "Ritual" also stated their intention to make a proposal to abandon fences at burial sites.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, in GBU "Ritual" said about the readiness to undertake the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors of cemeteries will be able to know GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, Ritual also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in the winter, when the land is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
In the forests of Helsinki, five days later, a lost mushroom was found.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours without provisions in the woods.
The discovery of the mountain mushroom was possible thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter was connected to search jobs.
On that day Vitaly Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the woods for pickets and pickets, but did not return until the evening.
The relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised in search of the mushroom - only about 30 people.
For the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrey Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Fire and Rescue Center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went a long way, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He has come a long way at his age.
The miracle remained alive.
Mushrooms were taken to the central district hospital in Helsinki without consciousness, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors do not imagine at all.
Valentina Nepsha, Head of the Therapeutic Department of the Hellenic Central Bureau of Medicine: "An examination is assigned to the patient, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains heavy, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but never deepened far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom farmer, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle not local."
Literally a few years came to visit, to visit relatives.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
He must have gone a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Only in the last few days five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind, so that you can then go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on average in the fraternal taiga.
On average, the emergency An-2 landed in Siberia.
The emergency landing of the aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Enisei" made in 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when it landed.
An-2 made a service flight.
On board were three crew members - the commander, the second pilot and the on-board mechanic, reports "Interfax".
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Brotherly Transport Prosecutor's Office after the emergency landing of the An-2 began the verification of compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
An investigative team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned safe airfield in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics were refused on the ship, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the plane’s emergency landing.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to the reduction of inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in the incomes of the population in the developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions of the University of Economics, Nobel Prize in Economics 2007.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more and more open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true," Muskin said.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so rainbow.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is manifested in the great inequality of incomes, or rather, wages.
But in reality, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by NIE HSE.
Together with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Cremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, according to the University of New York.
There are specific processes taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin singles out four levels of qualifications for specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualifications to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries earn higher wages through cooperation with B-level employees from the rich, then D-level workers don’t feel the growth or their wages fall at all.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to increasing the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to increasing the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Choice, head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Economics and Technology.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and companies are unprofitable to pay for their training.
In this situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, says Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory does not in any case call for the cessation of the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: the living connection of times.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all as if they came from the pages of "One Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Kaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plantains, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be poured aromatic tea and served with Dagestan delicacies - honey vinegar, horma, musmulo, miracle cakes, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large samovars have been used to drink tea to many guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in the 115th year of the Hijra.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior impresses with its scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of domestic birds put dovetails in the yards, under the trees, on the attic.

Over the years, the squirrels have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water pipe, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, have been preserved.

In Domodedovo there was a business "game in the airport".
A new form of education is being developed in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried themselves in the role of airport employees.
To do this, Domodedovo assembled models of three aircraft.
Young people not only supervised and registered passengers, but also serviced planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it did not give way to reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
It's a hell of a real airport.
For the one who settled in the hangar of Domodedovo - a standard set of tasks that beginners have to solve.
In one hangar fit three major airports from different countries of the world.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital’s colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of aviahavani.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of planes, turnover of luggage - they were entrusted even buses on the airfield, staircases and inspection of passengers.
Passengers are very problematic.
One had a mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for the flight service.
"For not fulfilling the relevant tasks, they are being fined," explained Dmitry Hilko, a financial analyst for the game, in an interview with the "Moscow-News" program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional centers of competence will be formed, which will be, in fact, new models of activity of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," - says the Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of labor personnel and additional professional.
But the students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to a claim to our airport on Instagram," said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game, the PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the Library of Foreign Literature of the American Center.
The center has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of our countries' relations," said U.S. Ambassador John Teft.
The American Center has established deep and strong ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” he said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX).
The Green Tribunal was quick to respond.
Typical situation: four officials are standing at the table of Judge Svater Kumar, listening to his claims about the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-page order to mock it, says Kumar.
If one more brick is laid, we will order all existing buildings to be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NCT), a judiciary body set up in 2010 to halt the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the turbulent economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had been able to review more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop construction leading to pollution.
The rates are unbelievably high: In less than 60 years since the declaration of independence, India has become one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute is the problem in large metropolises, where the development of infrastructure does not succeed in rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few new housing units have been built.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the environment minister called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “unfeasible.”
Sometimes it is really impossible to comply with the court’s decision within the time limit set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, unachievable deadlines also have a positive side: at least they make the responsible people move.
“His main goal is to override this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly abolished large-scale construction: it is responsible for the cessation of airport, power station and hundreds of smaller facilities.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of a judge’s pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp drop in popularity and a surge in criticism, Svatan Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered from the Delhi government statistics on incoming and outgoing motor vehicles, and also made an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned at the factories whether they are able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s attention, popular anger gradually began to subside.
But the most sickening topic of the principle judge was the program to clear the river Ganges, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and cries out.
Do you know what the word “holy” means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges to the statue of God, and in it there was feces, - the judge is hot. -
You continue to pollute the river because you think: Gang is Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama, and 455 other items from his personal collection, to the Ganges Rescue Fund.
Ecologists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an inadmissible luxury,” says Call of the Ganges activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle ground between ecology and development.”
The man poured blood on several Dali paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga smashed the windows of the museum and damaged the sculpture of Salvador Dali "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum now hosts an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately led inappropriately: ruined the sculpture, smashed the windows.
Then he began to move around the premises and stained with blood several works of permanent exposure.
Among them is a portrait of the Message of the Myervaldis Polis Brush.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobychin, to whom “Interfax” refers, the showcases were also damaged.
Police and art experts work at the scene of the incident.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been opened against the man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists, from August 4 to September 27, there is an exhibition of Picasso and Dali’s works, which presents more than 200 original works of artists.

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in a statement to a group tasked with leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including on regulating investor access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging public enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will provide the market with a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring legality in the business sphere and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it gives to companies, thereby ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy with respect to foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be further simplified by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
