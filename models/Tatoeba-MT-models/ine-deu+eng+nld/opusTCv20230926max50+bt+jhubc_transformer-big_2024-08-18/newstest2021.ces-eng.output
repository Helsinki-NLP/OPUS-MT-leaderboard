Newcomer helped Trabzonspor to second place, also hit <0xC5><0xA0>koda
Defender Filip Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas behind them.
Attacker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, which saved himself even though he fell 1:3 on the Fenerbahce field.
The newcomer confirmed the defender's excellent productivity by the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, goalkeeper Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer fired the ball into the net from the corner.
The home team managed to equalize five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setup took the victory to his side when he successfully finished the break of four to one.
The injury in the opening of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo at 1:1.
Risespor did not hold the indecisive state for a long time, but it did not have to be hated, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition concludes the Sunday duel of champion Basaksehir at the Kasimpasa field.
The well-hidden Cave at the settler in the forests near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was in fact uninhabitable
In the north of the Czech Republic, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsk, in the forests led by the Hrab<0xC4><0x9B>c<0xC3><0xAD> cesta, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and artificially created.
And we're going to get behind that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave of the Invader.
In fact, however, no settler ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock shelter and accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is practically not visible until the last moment.
It is revealed by the narrow staircase leading to some kind of rock gallery, from where it is only entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human habitation, at the time of its creation there could have been a field on the high plateau, where today there is a forest.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and is not even located in the traditional location of the boiler room, clearly proves that no settler could never survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrouzek from the Faculty of Philosophy Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The one-room object has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrouzek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of tools.
Breaking off the sandstone with a tip was quite simple and quick for the devotees.
It was enough to use the joints and gradually break the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail to the tip and the method of cutting, the period of formation of the cave can be framed.
According to historians, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there sometimes someone sleeps there today.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you will find a flowing stream under the cave and a nearby gravel path, then you will definitely find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captured by the nearby Havran<0xC3><0xAD> rock.
<0xC5><0xBD>okej Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly eases the situation for me and also the care for Finja’s daughter,” said Katja Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k’s wife, Jezdci.cz.
“Everyone is doing their best, Philip now needs time to recover.
It makes no sense to give any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the woman, a forty-five-year-old jockey.
In a tweet, star Frankie Dettori, who won the eighth race of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, equalized the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,000 has been collected on Gofundme.
The aim is a sum of 100 thousand euros (2.6 million CZK).
Video referee took four goals from Sassuola footballers, they lost 0:2
Sassuola's players did get the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to reconcile with a 0:2 defeat.
None of their goals was acknowledged by the referee after consulting the video due to the offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record inconvenience to technology, so many interventions VAR has never thwarted one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta dello Sport said in a statement.
"Festival of Sassuola's unrecognized goals.
VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had settled.
Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s goal was not recognised after the video referee intervened due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>'s intervention and goals by Francesc Caput and Domenic Berardi were not paid for.
The home team added another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were the most recharged in history.
"Growth was driven by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, Head of Clean Technologies at <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car manufacturer, but also supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also reporting their share of the market.
The operator of classical pumping stations is represented by MOL.
But she has no numbers yet.
"We only started building our electric mobility network last year," company spokeswoman Jana Juskov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
However, the editorial board of the Diary exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
As a result, the drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If you skip the small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place at a free rate.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical expense was around 330 crowns.
E-mobility is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five most charged chargers of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will overshadow the entire regional cities with its popularity.
Between the regions Olomouc leads.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border region, for example in Bohumin or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey of the newspaper "Czech in motion", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s actions to date on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more radical approach.
The event titled Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here, for example, who are long-term opponents of the expansion at the Tur<0xC3><0xB3>w mine, there are people who are opposed to the excavation of gravel at the Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people who are opposed to the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Volfov<0xC3><0xA1> told the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the countryside, a drastic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to promote sustainable agriculture and the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not ruthless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostransk<0xC3><0xBD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> was placed a stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to settle for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of cane beetroot" or "Less coal, more boats".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda of the Association For Water for People, which is protesting against the plan to mine gravel in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, came to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned excavation of the gravel is only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to reviews, it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovy Vary for the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms, which do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, but they do not cause such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
An ultra-light plane crashed into a flat in West Germany today, killing three people and injuring two others.
According to local emergency services, two crew members and one resident of the house are likely among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
The firefighters have already managed to control the flames.
Local fire chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, said it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which probably served as a brake on landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane collapsed in the air before hitting the ground.
The Czech Savings Bank incorrectly charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been removed
The Czech Savings Bank incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients on Saturday afternoon twice.
According to bank spokesman Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k, the problem could be related to thousands of transactions.
She has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were recorded by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday) we did an update of the system and immediately returned all these double payments to our clients.
At this point, everything works without problems," Drupal said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice, the spokesman of the bank does not know, according to his estimate, it was lower than thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problems is determined by the saver.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Drupal said.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch will present a system of three emergency stages against the coronavirus on Monday
"It will be gradual according to the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch in <0xC4><0x8C>T.
These are so-called traffic lights, each region will be marked with green, orange or red depending on the risk of the coronavirus.
The minister added that he will still talk with epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian region would have an orange color and Prague would be approaching him.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
Vodn<0xC3><0xAD>k and Karolinka
When the waterman Jonas and the miller’s daughter Karolinka look at each other, they have no easy task at all.
Jonah is hindered in love by his father, the untiring guide Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Caroline, from this aquatic villain.
How about he intrigues and lies?
Especially when he can get Caroline to reject Jonah and give preference to him, a strong Libor.
Soon it will be clear to everyone in the village who can drown the late Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the rotten flour, the fire of the mill and other poisons.
Enraged villagers organize a hunt for a waterman, and Jonah’s head is also hit by an irreconcilable water curse.
And now Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ka's soul, Karolinka!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of <0xC4><0x8C>T and in the exteriors near the pond Brzin, in Obd<0xC4><0x9B>nice in Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>ansk and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

They will also buy coupons for free and test drives by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person at the motorway worker in the starting tower.
“We have started to improve the e-shop to be user-friendly, while at the same time expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be acquired through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1 000 CZK for all safe driving courses from our offer.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of the coronavirus, or a summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious departments of hospitals are semi-empty, even as the numbers of infected grow.
"This situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch confirms.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic culminated in our country, everyone wore clothes, the army carried out collections, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with COVID-19, a maximum of two people die.
The highest number of infected per population still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another nursing home for seniors was closed in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradecka.
The disease was confirmed by tests at one of the nurses.
“We are drawing, we have limited movement, we have all the hygienic measures,” says Martin Sch<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>l, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients at home have symptoms of the disease so far.
Surface testing will begin to perform hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Brno Institute of Oncology today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will recognize if people have a cloth on the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the company Prachatice.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh writes a fairy tale, Anderson throws it away
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh showed an excellent performance even in the fight with the player who won the second most prestigious company within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at a score of 8:7 for the Belgian goalkeeper.
Van den Bergh took a break with the 13-string leg and has since had the upper hand.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the more experienced "Flying Scot" could hardly get to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in hand is also evidenced by the fact that the distraught Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th league.
In addition, the young Belgian managed great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh league, in an unfavorable condition, he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
Rather, he threw the arrows, and his triumphant opponent was doing absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh changed the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The winning of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian dartsman, as it is his first major to win.
The last player who managed to beat van den Bergha was Karel Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, the accusations for the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organs.
Suspicion of arson was investigated by investigators because the fire was proceeding through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs of anyone getting into the cathedral by force at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present "semaphores" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play the role of a pandemic plan, due to which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"It will be gradual according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in the individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be imposed at individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear clothes or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television program, Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for people to have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with talking about the declaration of a state of emergency or the resumption of a crisis headquarters.
In view of the growing number of infected people in the whole of the Czech Republic since Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear robes at internal events of more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1,000 people.
The government’s approach, where it was not clear until the last minute what measures would come into force and when they would be announced, has been criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main factors should create a sense of security and address the confusion on the contrary," Senator Marek Hilser said in Questions.
Measures can already vary according to the region, for example, in Prague since Sunday there is an obligation to wear clothes even in non-residential health facilities, ie, in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at a doctor.
The duty to wear clothes when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
In Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Jihlava, it is necessary to wear clothes in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in health facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures have been released, as well as in the Central Bohemian region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which colourfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities do not require Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test or quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
Currently, all EU Member States are in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues.
Playing at a third capacity, she had to finish at noon
Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening police estimates, there are about 500 people left here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning it was 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Originally, the techno-party was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems were actually quiet.
“Some have already left and others are about to leave.
Music production is still in full swing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and breakdown of music systems," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“Police officers are still systematically checking out departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before departure," she added.
The action is supervised by dozens of law enforcement officers, there is a foreign police, traffic and law enforcement officers on the spot, and there are also dog walkers with service dogs in the emergency room.
"During the day, the police checked 470 people moving around the event site and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A total of 95 drivers tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people attended the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not been reduced, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by the Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on the Prima Partie television programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparty had also extended to surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use it for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Fans of techno on the meadow near Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>ima in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska, where the technoparty took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where the technicians finally arrived.
According to Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>i.
Snake bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
Snake stabbed a girl in the leg, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," M<0xC3><0xA1>ria Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, a regional spokeswoman for the health rescue service, told the newspaper, after which the child was transferred to the hospital in Klatovy.
Snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of a snake stinging you are not too high, she is afraid of herself when she is in regular contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to squat away for a loud sigh.
They will attack only if they feel very threatened - for example, if you mistakenly step on them.
Even her stinging is not a tragedy, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but people will not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk is therefore primarily for children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting after stinging, sweating, increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergies, an anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Klatovsk Hospital described for the Journal.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
After the policeman poured wine and threw dishes
After 11:00 p.m., an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the man.
Kojenec was immediately taken into the care of health professionals, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
One day, he even climbed out the window sill himself, where he crouched.
Police are still investigating the man.
Further information is not yet available.
Stosurov<0xC3><0xA1> will give preference to her daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not hit the coronavirus-affected season again this year.
The 34-year-old U.S. Open champion, who became a mother in June, has yet to finish her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
“I’ll stay home, spend time with my family, be at all those little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it,” she said in a statement.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season from March 3 with an antuk tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the site carried 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller does not have proof of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, which contained almost half a tonne of unlabeled food without proof of origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be determined, some of the products had a past shelf life and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
In May last year, veterinarians with police officers detained 80 kilograms of food at the market site without proof of origin, including dried fish, locusts or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in the Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is expected to start from midnight.
According to the Kremlin, Putin criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new ceasefire on Wednesday evening with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is set to begin after midnight on Monday night, be "complete and universal" and pave the way for further provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospect of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the upcoming elections to local legislatures will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky's office said the two citizens agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in the Donbas and the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat areas or withdrawing part of the troops from the frontline.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula, and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front line in occasional shootings and artillery attacks.
The conflict in the Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West are accusing Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyy has made the end of the war in the Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet occurred.
Unexpected champion in the deciboj is Rikl, the seven-fighter dominated by Novotn<0xC3><0xA1>
The defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not reach the end of Saturday's program four hundred, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> on Sunday did not jump the base in the bar.
Desetiboji was long ruled by Latvian national teammate Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for coach Josef Karas' group, but resigned after the record.
Rylk had two bronze medals from the outdoor M<0xC4><0x8C>R so far, this time he was the only ten-man to cross the seven-thousand border.
Another medal was awarded to Vilém Str<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urb<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The rally after the competition reminded of the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
"It's a shame the guys weren't here and he didn't set up Kope, because that would have made the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a persona by 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disk, there I was below average," he admitted on the union's Facebook page.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> won the first day of the seven-fight with more than a dominance of the pole, even though she was afflicted by an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not overshoot 40 meters with a spear and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> scored 5878 points and won 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She has come a long way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wish it was around 630.
Yesterday I started pulling my calves, but I'm so glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or oil, given significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre traveled.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market in the pre-month and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio-LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in a mixture with the classic fossil LPG," said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k of Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically the same as the classic oil LPG, which many motorists are now fueling in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference from classic LPG is the way it is produced," says Ivan Indr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the association.
This is also said to be one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugarcane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, classical oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio-LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in English "from the source to the tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Litvin refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles are running on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number of cases decreased by 1775
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday’s 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is about 1,775 less infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The increase in the number of people cured is due to the revision of the data, which has not been able to update hygiene recently," said the head of health statistics Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 Covid-19 diseases, unfortunately, passed away.
Mobile Voting Units or Correspondence Choice.
Political scientist and sociologist looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in order for people in quarantine to be able to vote in the October regional and Senate elections due to the coronavirus, a change in the law is needed.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday in the Prima TV Party.
He wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to health conditions can not vote.
The voting ban should remain in place, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop told the OVM that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of the ANO or the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, this would rather be uploaded to other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overvalued.
Personally, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main thing is to be prepared for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pigs’ ears were thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojka Borisov and his cabinet threw their ears at the pigs' government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the “mafia style of government” that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
Today’s protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to R<0xC3><0xA1>dio Svoboda/Radio Svoboda.
At 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some of the streets had to be closed for transportation.
The demonstrators staged a theater in front of the government building, symbolically imprisoning Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
The resignation of both parties is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadzhigenov, said on public radio that a "peak of escalation" in the form of a "national demonstration in Sofia and a blockade throughout the country" is about to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated the demand for Borisov and his government to resign, as well as for early elections to be postponed.
The regular ones are due to take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to make Bulgaria a part of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, the Borissov government stopped voting on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Bologna Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> has had enough of the Italian league matches without a spectator.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're doing here right now is not football.
My teeth are full of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under such conditions, you won’t even know how the teams are doing.
So that this season is over.
Those measures had to be taken in order for the competition to take place, but I hope that from September they will be back as fans," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he was missing four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up the level.
We want to continue to grow and we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of cyberattacks of foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that erupted this month in underground nuclear operations in Natanz could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure faces “thousands of cyber attacks” every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to repel it.
In recent months, according to Musavi, there have been several broader cyberattacks, behind which, according to the analysis, “certain governments and groups” have been involved.
However, he did not give details of the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
The musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run agency IRNA this month discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, could have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the Iraqi militia leadership, Abu Mahdi Muhandis, on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a large number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the US is active.
The U.S. has since admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25
The Cologne-based automaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25, in the morning.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said carmaker spokesman Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renovate it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubko, the reason for the extension of the stop are closed borders and closed dealerships, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent, that is, two shifts from the beginning.
Coronavirus affects key markets of the company, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the TPCA production stoppage is not a sign of life in the city.
“I knew it from the beginning, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets fill up, especially since Monday, when it has become very loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
"In the past two months, we have not had to solve almost any problems," Kaspar said.
For example, <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are running at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs approximately 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer Killed Bride Shortly After Marriage: Leaves Message to Family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling her cancer, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease reappeared.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in bed in a hospice, where she had enough to take her life's love.
Unfortunately, the disease has subsided.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she has lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around the world.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman was sporting and living healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma actually seemed to have overcome the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the British daily Daily Mirror, underwent a 10-hour spinal surgery and then began drastic treatment again.
But it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post that Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who’s been by my side all along and has given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all my followers on social media,” she wrote, adding that everyone should respect their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, a passing handicraft is usually obtained by beginner Czech artists.
The images and other creations are created directly for the artifact, so they know in advance that they have to fit in size 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curator's text about the artist and then the work itself," project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Artmat works on the principle of coincidence.
The buyer can be surprised at what kind of artwork he gets.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>topla or mini-views by Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutkov<0xC3><0xA1> prepared a pexeso associated with a walk in Prague.
The cards should be paired with the house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrov<0xC3><0xA1> and Juli<0xC3><0xA1>na Chomov<0xC3><0xA1> are selling a pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a troudnet and a herald card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book The Spiritist.
Salaries in healthcare will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
Bigger increase is unrealistic according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Salaries in the healthcare sector could increase by a maximum of five percent in the next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) said in Questions of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Moravce on Czech TV.
The union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protection aids.
The hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (in wages) can be anywhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, which since March has interfered in the selection of the insurance pandemic of the coronavirus and the government regulations against its spread.
Income from insurance companies fell at the time.
"A 15 percent increase is unrealistic at the moment," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS), the average monthly earnings of doctors in acute bedside care are likely to reach 88,312 CZK this year, nurses 47,498 CZK.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
It is also apparent from the data of the UTIS that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by salary tables, and the contractual wages in hospitals in cities, counties or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that the payroll tables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the president of the Czech Chamber of Dentistry Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, trade unionists should perceive what the state is currently on.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the rewards of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the Board of Health Providers does not agree with a flat-rate salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and health facilities themselves, and the money should go to them through the payment decree.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Chairman of the Administration of State Material Reserves (SSHR) Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr said this week that the administration does not currently own any protective medical aid.
Waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The crumbling smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We are ready to report
“A smart quarantine is working, there is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not run it all again," the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show "Chew People".
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the prime minister in the Moravian-Silesian region, where they are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he had no information on Sunday's talks and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
The Smart Quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central control team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The crushing project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that he could be taken back by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government commissioner for IT and digitalization Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
“The system is working, but it’s still working.
For twenty years it was created independently and without a system, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People on the march, the poor on the hygiene on the march are adapting the new systems and actually catching the mistakes," he said.
The mayor of Ostrava Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fool in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Macura (YES) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "do nothing in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the chairmanship of the ANO movement, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
“I thought I would go through one term and with that experience in business, I could turn everything around and get on my feet,” he said.
He added that for the second term he was allowed to be persuaded to some extent.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don’t want to be a fool in politics,” Macura said, describing himself as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macron’s possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman's anti-candidate Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the election.
From the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura is not planning to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one cares about it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he said.
Fifty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among other things.
He also served in other corporate bodies.
Uber will return to Brno to offer transportation services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, offering transportation services.
This is a consequence of the amendment of the law, said in a press statement on Thursday the Brno City Council for Transport Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as the designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, since July, the law has changed the conditions for operating regular and alternative taxis.
In recent weeks, Kratochvil has held several talks with representatives of Uber.
"On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return with its services to Brno.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city was aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has been operating in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking the vehicles as a taxi or missing a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary ruling banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of the year, Mayor Markéta Van<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later decisions of the courts, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
As of July, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile apps in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter.
Too lush celebration in Brno: flying chairs hit a meter from a person on the sidewalk
The office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment on Saturday evening in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a walker followed him and immediately called the officers.
The guard immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city noticed an open window, under which there were still chairs and next to it a few cans and bats.
"The movement that took place from the fourth floor of the room suggested that there was a rather noisy celebration inside.
The guards walked down the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Request for revocation of Rafaje discusses Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats the request for a motion to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (AOHS) Petr Rafaje.
The non-profit organizations called for the appeal of Rafa to the government's anti-corruption council and also the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
The Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>TK Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed a third time.
His appeal is within the competence of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
The reason should be, among other things, Rafa's case of recent times.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would familiarize himself with the materials and the government parties would take "some opinion" on it.
He also said that he has not yet negotiated with the president, a meeting with him has not been negotiated in the near future.
According to the EEAS, there is no reason for the appeal, since Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, the servers of IHNED.cz and Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj<0xC3><0xA1>’s meeting with Hejtman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings were related, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the project of a controversial new hospital in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek strongly advocates.
Chunk admitted the meeting, according to him, they dealt with his "senate activities" together.
Raphael says the same thing.
The representative office of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>k region called on the government at the end of June to appeal Rafa<0xC3><0xAF>.
It also calls for reform of the agency’s decision-making mechanisms.
According to Deputy Head of Transport Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nek, the decision of the EEAS on public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a tender to select a toll.
This year in June, the server Aktu<0xC4><0x85>l<0xC4><0x85>.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written for the company of influential backstage player Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>uba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj from 9 July 2009, for the second term the President of the former Member of the Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Raphael's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Authority Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Authority on a proposal from the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not been in office for more than six months or if he seriously infringes the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees were collapsing in the Blanes library.
Air-conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warmer months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of Blanska's readers, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Dlapy library, temperatures in the building often climbed up to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun rests on it for a large part of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because overnight the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have 30 degrees in the library from morning onwards," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study and the reading room on the third floor.
And the floor above the showroom and the principal.
An unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians collapsed at work and ended up in work incapacity.
The problem also regularly occurred in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes you couldn't breathe," Dlapa said.
Originally, the city wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three out of five circuits.
“Due to limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic spaces.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on the upper floor," informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda from Blanen's investment department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers already installed air technology in the said premises in the autumn last year and adjusted the electrical wiring.
About 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko City Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
It is about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
The Chicago Uprising has expelled the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not all of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to an NHL player who is silent about the health of players like a grave and doesn’t disclose anything at all.
He was one of the few to leave Crawford.
The thirty-five-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session, since then he has been missing in the squad.
"I would like to let you all know that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last 14 days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans don’t have to worry about their health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full force.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicagem, a solid part of the goal is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are in a preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the forecourt.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deals with the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place outside Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, or in a park in Tel Aviv.
There have been regular protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks now.
Its participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is tackling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, citing Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
70-year-old Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister to be tried in office.
He has been charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all accusations and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, more than 300 witnesses have been summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Israel, which has a population of about nine million, has been confirmed by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people have died in connection with the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March that helped reduce the daily rises of those infected.
After the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, however, the number of infected began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics say the government has not helped enough, for example, businessmen affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also troubled by the fact that the government is issuing controversial guidelines in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut from the wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident occurred around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapske dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at a considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be released from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are examined by the police.
They ordered a court autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and wasting one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to snort one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is not new.
Every year, billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills.
The view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi’s goods were sold at full price.
The second half, which was sold due to discounts, simply will not buy.
The company does not want to snort one collection after another and at the end of each season discount products below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount traders are already counting on the purchase of goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a fraud," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mitka.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti depicts RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the city's leadership," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intense work.
It consumed about 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-<0xC5><0xA0>anov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they held him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig moved to the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and the natives of Teplice, who granted him an honorary citizenship.
Sixty-four-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known by people in the street graphic art industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in warm streets for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas designated for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna hit the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight GMT on the night of today).
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened as it moved over the mainland in a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local floods, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings came from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but overall it is expected to live to hit an area nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous tornadoes and a single tornado can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but this gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it progressed to the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
Local authorities have urged the storms to survive at home and not to forget the sanitary measures associated with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states in the U.S. that is most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to observe distances, evacuation is also a great challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after the evacuation, who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to the infection.
Local authorities have called on all evacuated people to take their clothes and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We're not even far behind yet.
We are expecting catastrophic flooding," Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, said in a statement.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rainfall could rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which could flood a number of coastal settlements together with rising sea levels.
Zeman grants general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will grant the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is based on an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for the award of the rank of Brigadier General is the August accession of Lipka to the post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Multinational Division of the North-East in Poland.
Lipka still acts as a deputy of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, July will replace Brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehka as Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division of the North-East in Elbl<0xC4><0x85>g, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance's advanced presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltic.
In March, <0xC5><0x98>ehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president that Lipko be granted the rank of Brigadier General.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the duration of an elected office or for the duration of a service assignment that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall be held by the General Staff.
A soldier to whom a rank has been assigned has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to the rank.
The award of the rank shall take place without regard to the reason for which it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional preparedness and is a role model for his subordinates.
In a significant way, it participates in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Defense Ministry said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday’s promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar or Chief of General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
EU countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wearing of robes in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Aircraft must also be provided with sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy mid-seat seats.
The common rules on which the officials have agreed meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused turmoil.
In the Arctic Spice Mountains fell a temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, surpassing the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spice beans heat up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could even rise by ten degrees if the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Temperature rises in Spitsbergen can result in the melting of perennial frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
Britons who return from Spain await mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to go to isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the diplomat said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she said.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the world.
The British are concerned, among other things, about whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne booked a 10-day holiday to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with my whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don’t know what’s going to happen.
I work as an engineer and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation,” he said.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently pointed out the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
Dukovan’s electricity purchase model is being discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The draft law expects that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the buy-in price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ energy company have already stated that the more likely option is that people will save for electricity thanks to construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has shown several times in the past.
This has been criticized by environmental organizations.
“The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people on the Dukovan construction will earn money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns a year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay in electricity bills annually to support so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the ransom price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it should be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now most stocked, is currently around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10, the average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - may correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including electric hobs and ovens - can not be used in electric ovens and ovens," the company said.
“We are living in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of Energy financial group.
The proposed law assumes that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, or a legal person entrusted by it, owned by the state at a pre-determined price.
The contract between the investor and the state guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but not longer than the end of the low-carbon production operation.
A low-carbon production design is defined as a nuclear-reactor power generation connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity with a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek previously said that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed free of interest by the state during construction, with a two-percent interest rate for the operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and is troubled by the possibility of Dukovany being built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also pay all possible additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has withdrawn material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
According to the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic two billion crowns, the office withdrew from the commentary procedure.
Minister Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) of the server SeznamZz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>y.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the server Zdopravya.cz.
The ministry has justified the plan with the collapse of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in revenues.
The proposal provoked criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website glidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to put money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising in television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or flats at stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of them would get private TVs Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million, and the same amount would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or in the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> said without further details of the server ListamZz<0xC3><0xA1>zy.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarov<0xC3><0xA1> Adamov<0xC3><0xA1>, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) would benefit from the advertising.
"I firmly believe that this appalling contempt will get a blow in the eye in the autumn elections," she wrote on Twitter.
Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told Diary N on Friday.
According to her, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course we're still counting, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism sector, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, chairman of the initiative.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Sourdough from life, beer tap and death as the stem of grass
The third album is also posthumous and the death is the stem of the grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s discography it is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov’s poetry, which he himself is an excellent performer.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, born in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through his own, personally presented experiences and also very internal expressions of faith.
There was, however, some agitation at a distance, whether he was talking or writing about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example), the masters forgive.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>’s album offers recordings of the author’s reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poems.
"Their pride and incessant bitterness," writes Pear, "was poured out upon the state of our world endangered by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly sinking into the numbness of consumer vanity and greed, is increasingly drifting away from what its soul was created from – from the mysteries of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a hint in them of the one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that it is not possible to give up them simply because of general negligence.
These poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it doesn’t matter how one loses it.
If he sells himself to general decline, skeptically resigns, intimidatedly shuts up, or remains until the last moment in quiet and proud perseverance on what he believes and loves.
Paroubek is not my adviser, said Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek
Former Prime Minister and President of the Czechoslovak SSR Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
Party President and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said it today on the Prima Partie television show.
Paroubek should be Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s adviser, the server SeznamZz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>y.cz reported on Friday.
"From time to time we will write an essay, he will occasionally send me some material and I will read it," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That I read his opinion from time to time is a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochov<0xC3><0xA1>, the minister said that many ODS members are still “uncovered listening to the views of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus”.
He said this is okay because he is an experienced politician and former party president, as is the case with Paroubka.
The fact that the media are making an affair out of it is a sign of this year's cucumber season.
On Friday, the server SeznamZzvo<0xC5><0x82>y.cz wrote that Paroubek is acting as Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth candidate of the party in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region is headed by the former chairman of the cell there, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubka and acted as the deputy chairman of his party LEV 21.
Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that he will not comment on the candidate's composition until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, pitiful Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American bartender has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious rivals to the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat a two-year-old Duplantis at a meeting of the NCAA last year.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases, it was a very good match,” describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has fired up steeply and is currently alone in the highest spheres of the rod.
In just twenty years he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toru<0xC5><0x84> he surpassed the 6.17-metre mark, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of accomplishments is thinner than the one Duplantis prides himself on, the American sets similar goals.
He has so far indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Panamanian Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought in the US expedition to the 13th world championship.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“Definitely my priority is to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself,” he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead the same way at events like the Olympics, the World Championships or the Panamanian Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other staffers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere silver battle?
"Everyone's trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a disabled son’s pension.
The court awaits her
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
Women face up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court stripped the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was to manage, among other things, the son’s money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own needs, thus depriving him of 440 thousand crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that the accused woman was burdened with the caretaker's custody.
The woman, according to the court order, had set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to his account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment said.
The woman admitted that she couldn’t use her son’s money for her own needs.
However, she defended herself by helping them with their family expenses.
“We’ve had problems with our incomes tightening up the household.
We have never bought anything above the standard.
It was always about things that the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman told police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Finds from Chiquihuite Cave in Zacatecas, Mexico, include 1930s limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they're here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people of the cave of Chiquihuita, located at a high altitude, inhabited for a long 20,000 years.
Until now, a widely accepted theory has said that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
This model, however, suffered cracks in the last few decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, describes 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland sooner than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
"It's clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clown culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in tickets so far meets an optimistic scenario, the sellers claim.
Prices are also gradually declining.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half that, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
According to vendors, post-crisis developments meet the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of tickets are also gradually decreasing.
According to sellers, South European countries are among the most sought after destinations.
According to Kiwi.com data, they are headed by Spain, Italy and Greece.
Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz sells the most flights to Split, Croatia.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought after, which, of course, was one of the most crowded destinations ever.
The average price of tickets is also decreasing.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz in the middle of the month, it was around 6250 CZK, 3,000 CZK less annually.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European countries, such as Spain or Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in the past few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com, the time it takes to buy a ticket before departure has been reduced by about ten days per year.
“This confirms the future trend of people ordering flights much less in advance, requiring more flexibility, less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indel<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, vice president of products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
By the end of last summer, it is about half the destinations.
A great finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has made its way to the grand final.
It will feature experienced ninety-four-year-old Scottish dartsman Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then bumped into his next-door neighbor in the standings.
However, he also dealt with James Wad, and in the quarterfinals, he fought vigorously with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"The Flying Scot" was about to make it to the semi-finals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped from the shovel, dominated in the extension and after the result 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensur Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D>e 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall of the World Six, defeated Jo Cullen in a dramatic battle and Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp start.
The big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the start, but calmly playing the Belgian then won an excellent series, which then held up more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he encountered occasional uncertainty in the doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been proven to infect 15,212 people.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
There are currently 5,254 people who are sick.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 on the day before, and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have already been cured of COVID-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of Covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants still accounts for Karvinsko, almost 59.
It is followed by Jihlava district with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increase in the number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear robes at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, such as cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven infected with the new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million mark.
This is according to the Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from COVID-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infections, had the largest share of the rapid growth in recent days, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where almost 1.4 million people have been infected, according to authorities.
Infected people are now growing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases worldwide have been added from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in human states such as the United States, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases has increased in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced today by the DPRK.
Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Health damages air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who was quoted as saying in The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved to set up Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on household pests right now, as many people spend more time working from home.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than they did before, so it’s time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes,” she said.
In Israel, the quality of "domestic air" is almost nobody's business.
Dangerous, however, can be things that a person commonly comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"Gift gas is also released by the clothes that we regularly wear to the cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with breathing problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer problems such as headaches, fainting, irritability of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all harmful substances come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel Quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came to Spain because of a coronavirus infection in the team for a chance to advance to the top of the Spanish football league.
The competition's management canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the play-off.
Fuenlabrada on Saturday reported another 12 people infected, bringing the total number of positive tests for COVID-19 in the club to 28.
Due to the infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough point to get into the playoffs.
The competition's management said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitively canceled in view of the higher power due to the fact that it was never held again.
Fuenlabrada took the decision.
Against not winning the match, on the contrary, La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a is storming.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even the victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the customs of complete in a single term.
The leadership of a former elite Spanish club is in danger of falling into the third league by the court.
The first two teams of the Huesca and C<0xC3><0xA1>diz table have certainty of progress between the elite.
Zaragoza, Almer<0xC3><0xAD>a, Girona and Elche will face off in the playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"Dad didn't need him for many years," Gott Dominic's eldest daughter told Aha! that the Master couldn't come up with a name for Havel, and that whenever a word came up to him, it always pissed Karl off.
It's hard to tell what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute started sometime in the mid-nineties.
“Dad said in a post-revolutionary article that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a drawer at the time of darkness, but if he had somehow resisted, he would have had an end to his career," Gottov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
But he adds that the Czech giants eventually found their way to each other.
"I know that the word Havel could not have been heard at all by the time he was in his 60s.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday letter and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change," Dominica recalls.
Ten years later, even Gott invited the then former president to celebrate his seventies at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havel's father regularly invited him to Bertram's home," said the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slav<0xC3><0xAD>ka also said he hated that he had never received a state award from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
After all, he came to him in 2009, although it was already from the hands of his successor in the role of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus (79).
The current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to give him the Order of the White Lion to honor his memory.
Since Tuesday, there is a threat of heat in the Czech Republic, meteorologists warn of fires
The meteorologists’ warning of high temperatures applies to all Czechs except for the Karlovy Vary region on Tuesday afternoons, as well as to southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they said.
People are advised to observe a hot drinking regime and reduce body weight in the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, from Tuesday morning there will be a risk of fires.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns central Bohemia, including Prague, Libereck<0xC3><0xBD>, <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen Region.
The fire warning will be in effect until revocation.
"We do not expect significant rainfall in the north-west and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week to mitigate the danger," the Czech Ministry of Transport and Tourism said.
The Prague magistrate responded to the meteorologists' warning by banning fires at risk sites, which is due to apply from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to start open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics is also prohibited in these places.
The measure will remain in force until the appeal, Prague Mayor V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman said.
