The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# wholesaler and so it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs 179<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to assume a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let’s take a look, let’s help, let’s get the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help with the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy on its own for the short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can decide for yourself if this is right for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours while falling asleep.
Purely legal, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the statement of the psychologist is also coming.
Because if something really were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story but I don't want to think about the title partout anymore, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring himself with food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it eventually turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately confronts the patients with their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives with intent to die)
This fear is referred to in the book as “the fight.”
In the end, there was a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s so the rough action I’m pretty sure the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I don't have the password for Wi-Fi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splitters over the entire length under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull it with a tweezers.
Very hard to reach.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker as well as a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders automatically log in to a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read out with matching centrals.
For centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses allow 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake tracks as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake components or with DC voltage.
In addition, it also holds on to a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC commuter train allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC paths.
After my voucher is no longer extended due to a complaint that has not arrived with me, I will receive my order in the value of approx.

What should I do with this number?
Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to push for revamping
More and more omicrone cases are occurring in the UK.
By the end of the year, all eligible adults in the UK should receive a vaccination offer.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aiming to make even faster progress on coronavirus vaccinations than has been the case so far, given the rapid rise in omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday night.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be stepped up, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Now let's boost it up!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more omicrone cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favor of everyone presenting themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should present themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Just the one I bought today can't go
Obviously, the chair had an undeniable lack of sales.
How can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Attempted at the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That’s why I always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] Feeling like I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come in contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims can’t be helped or think we couldn’t help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to tears, is that all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t have to just accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incomprehensibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a stunning appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was reliance.
For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly".
However, after the game, it did not lay down - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Bundesliga.
Even more than the bare result disappointed the way the performance was performed.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is called a substitute: the three-way rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) on say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded: “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and didn’t implement what we trained.”
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "Winning a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already retreated 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Thankfully, there is not much time left to argue.
Already on Wednesday (7pm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have re-informed ourselves legally and have written to them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always like peeled from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to delight his audience with reinterpretations of drummers from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday this Sunday on stage in Leipzig.
But nothing will come of it.
The planned concert was postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to curb the coronavirus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period also have to come out first, as it is called on the website of the singer, who now becomes 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists will then want to reschedule their dates already postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has sung a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied operatic singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of drums and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For women this is not a problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he is on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check in advance if it fits in color
It still doesn't work I can only yearn for the cover sheet but not leaf.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert commission, as is to be done with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rent law.
The coalition agreement foresees a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax anyway, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will solve the independently with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does it take to ship itself?
I have already cut my finger
That's an absolute rudeness
At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States caused severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a 320-kilometer-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, that wherever the tornado went through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
It counts up to 100 deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she has sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, only I can order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the basket?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
With this, they are on a line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for a vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccine calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.
He switched to a company he taunted about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Clearly, he didn’t stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you back then, no matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take up the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screenshot.
Hello - I'm interested in the Boone dining table, white.
Is it also available in large 230cm?
In our online shop kitchenpoint.de we run all Smeg kitchen appliances and the corresponding accessories.
We generally check the quality and completeness of your order.
The new coffee machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the matt-coloured plastic surface in combination with the matt-brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG coffee machine with milk frother a design object.
According to the reduced design, all functions such as grinding rate and water quantity, as well as the choice between espresso, Americano, Ristretto or a mild coffee with only four buttons can be selected.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to salute!
I'm currently running the Over the Grip Pass adventure for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are devised, and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a truck with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action should develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is supposed to lure a group of goblins into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuasion, action, threats, early recognition of the danger, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In case of noticing the goblins lurking up the hero in a hollow path and flanking each three to my left and right arches armed the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If there is a fight and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then cured by the son of the village school, a half.
Of course the cart is gone.
Should a defeat be inevitable, this half intervenes with two of its servants and comes to the hero's aid in the fight.
The car is still there, everything is great.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter as a start to the adventure too much?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later, so is not only cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I am sure that I will master many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I re-built the lamp.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can then leave the return receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here was the lower part, that is, almost the part damaged with storage space.
Will everything be picked up again or only part of the storage room?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
For the first time, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has been broadcasting the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided that the tyres should be changed when there were corresponding radio broadcasts on the subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for moving.
I think such basic rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV station.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, I don’t like Roos’s elaborate commentary style, but admit it’s a matter of taste.
But there I seriously like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant whims, both of which make it seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertisement simply takes precedence at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to it on F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the training than Sky, and this as a free TV station.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1’s program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job in the four races that they are allowed to transfer, except for the advertising.
In any case, the great F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the stool).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK-series has a special, soundproof construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet by means of an air hose 4/6 mm etc... and it can already start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards that the water from the basin would run through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up here daily.
Everything is going well on the road, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, there is no corona here.
Please do not rate as bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,...they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be mean to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Is it possible to order the legs in the light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under the radiant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly selected astronauts upon their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were travelling for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, who had paid the other four passengers for their tickets.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to space immediately, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The New Shepard missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, sometimes with gravitylessness, before the reusable object landed again braced by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-in-one trip: In July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On the second in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also joined by former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief executive Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory I do not mind (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I have already informed myself about career prospects before the study, but also at the time that I definitely want to study until the doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear always great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly underpaid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied / What training have you done?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your feedback!
I am currently really insecure and am thinking of possibly quitting my studies in 2022 and getting a training as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, I’d love to write it too :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That’s why I have a post about it now.
Not only before the big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there are those also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was Maria’s Ascension, which is called “Ascension” in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is why it is semi-official.
There was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter e-mails, which necessarily had to be out before the ride, order here order there, everything *definitely* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do all the serious things in a shortened week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed then on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully stimulated.
What is this self-isolation for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can’t afford them properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent.
My question is simple: are we the only ones who are Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but still has no gifts at all.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the party by baking and basteling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the thoughtful days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of mice and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in the birdhouse is solely due to dietary errors.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mausoleum are due to lack or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamins should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and faulty parts see photos, function well, the locomotive series E 95
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally upgraded
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft) commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens sugarcane works with the electric part, as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG bearing drive.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnverbesserungswerk Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the re-electrification of the central German network led to an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were upgraded, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger quantities, were preferably first constructed.
It was only when the E 94 was intended that the number of reworks could not be increased further that the E 95 came into the spotlight of rework.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Warhen railway station.
In 1960 they arrived at the railway station Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complex control of the locomotives turned out to be problematic with increasing age.
So it happened more often that shooters stayed glued to shift actions.
Then the sideman who was constantly driving on this locomotive with hammer and wooden wedge had to release the shooters again during the ride.
Damage to the drive motors occurred more often and led to months of downtime with the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new construction locomotives and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most splitter types, so the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only in one man, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver's seat, would have resulted in a problem in train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were last followed by the E 95 01, which ceased service on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a turn-key heating system at the Halle main station.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially redesigned with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since been part of the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is kept in a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional association Bw Halle P have been working on the operational upgrading of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, with the transformers being tested and five driving motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side tracks, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig as a central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to rework the locomotive in self-work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of warehousing.
The F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the bar can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center bar does not fit into the provided bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the mold, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
With me they are not flat
Could I have these sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was intentional.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it will come much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To deter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness moved him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has released a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was not supposedly vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For a few months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I'm being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
“I am currently legally not allowed to get the vaccine myself,” Shahin said at the time.
In Germany there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to his own information.
Fire in recirculation plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a relay station.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have been without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire with severe damage at a relay station.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities were exposed to the fire.
The Westnetz utility reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the county, the fire department and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a statement on Saturday night.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to complete, as the Westnet installers were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he said.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire, which erupted on Friday around 7:15 p.m., has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back up.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 pm.
Since 23:15, the last ones affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 installers of Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or lonely people and notify local fire departments when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the residents of Altenheimen were the main focus.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary places of care have been established in schools for those people who were unable to provide for themselves or who require or rely on medical care for the power-dependent medical devices.
Good morning. Good morning.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.

But I can't mount the undercarriage on the table top.
It is a custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t shove it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back because it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost shameless.
We do not agree with this

To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry them with clear water.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt mug.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light overlapping of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
As a result, unrealistic surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal shavings can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them up.
The models achieve their original look through the decals or decals.
From license plates on airplanes to ship names to decorative strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when sticking time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and arrange it for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you moisten their backside briefly with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then you slide the image just a small piece of paper and put the piece to the appropriate spot on the model (which you also wetted before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper away from the side.
Warning: Always check the image to see if it fits properly before sliding it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, scratch or even tear.
Suction off excess water with a household cloth.

Can I get it back without any problems?
Treatment for children with PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child wish treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses over.
The series by:
We had applied to the PKV for the children's wish train in advance and received the pledge over 3 attempts.
Attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but this did not yet count with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and were again allowed 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are calculated with the PKV), we filed the invoices with the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first pledge expire.
The second child request is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the pledges that with one birth the further attempts would expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to reach them again
It's all right.
We will no longer order from you.
When they add the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
You can pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't wait for the dresser to arrive at me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear and clear that the refund was triggered and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months is valid.
No, it is not possible for me to purchase another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but unfortunately we can not find these with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget film is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What's bothering you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it reliable now too?
Thank you!
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will give up again soon, because it just does not work here.
Hello!
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of flux - Belarus does not give very little, but the EU feels like a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State sets out to do its thing," as Poland currently does, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-attempted border crossing
According to Polish border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, an official spokeswoman said Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned in the incident near the town of Czeremsza by migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, border guards recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having lured them into the EU with the prospect of entering Minsk.
Poland and Lithuania have blocked border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"Then the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough ties and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly drag thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have broken two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen at Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have regularly overhauled.
A second objection was raised against the score at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes in the last lap and had moved on to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch had overtaken the car driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the name of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited fans to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and permanent card holders of the Breisgau sports club as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains lit up red and white through the jerseys that day.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop,” says the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesliga player and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, the partnership has again shown how well it fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

I already had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal noises at her front door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your messed up chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email hasn't arrived yet.
The package would like to bring it to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It’s like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
They both won’t admit it.
But Colleagues are constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you just have to let it go completely.
Wow, you’re not as serious as a friend.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just messing with nonsense.
And so you're an enemy of science and not to take it seriously like a colleague
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass in a practical way and without any colour errors up to the edge zone.
Lupes are often marked with magnifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes are formed on the lens surfaces of all optical devices – that is, even in case of impact loops.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
For further information, please refer to the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced so many curious situations during the sale of pine trees.
One time a man was supposed to have gone home without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many strange situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little bit fun, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better judgment here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spike.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "drawer", which by far does not sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without fail, except for a few failures.
The new fiber connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer arrives at the full 500, but the further I get away in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I’m really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the checking account
Who would have thought that now would be the first time to rest with the giro accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to reconfirm the past fee increases with all sorts of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest rates also continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros long.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered it for a day's pay.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group’s Postbank division – to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 for giro and investment accounts and to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokeswoman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin even got right against this regulation.
Banks are already debating whether institutions should make provisions - in the event that even the highest authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
It is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their life is like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was named the Most Influential Woman of the Year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans are still flying at you is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just in luck - and still looking for the big love.
And has removed the baby's wish from the list.
She was always asked when she was going to be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight band touch, Räikkönen had to give up his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsports royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I calculated it once, I would have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday he defended against the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed a bit on the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd win in the series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race to eighth.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the Zweierbob on her home run.
After reaching only fourth place in the monobob on the day before, she raced for the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thuringia, Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, came in second place.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium place this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," Burghardt said, emphasizing: "It's not just pushing, but there's a lot to do."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore can't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Because of Corona last year I had completely different problems and never time for it.
And now it was said that he was gone, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why does shipping start on March 16th?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tip on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken away by your colleague yesterday.
Why this is a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe the one or the other is going to do it too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mum - apart from the fact that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 in 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has had a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burn).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid just had stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
And now we have housework to do, which of course we share with each other.
Cooking is a lot of work for me.
My PTBS disease is currently very well-adjusted, I am half-well-treated and I am doing well.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place anymore.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until my birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only till the weekend.
It's only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'm packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't make it...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think that has something to do with the mental load of women, and that’s why I thought I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
For the rest of the two times.
But it was not confirmed.
At school, I found out that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and it’s just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed that way.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if you just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
To preserve culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English I understand this well too
It's been a very long time, then I'd give up
All right, thank you.
I hope to get back to you soon, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help please
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
The modern (real) world.
The past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it any more in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live for himself, I think.
The passage is also, I believe, the soldier's grave.
At the end of the day, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If I say so, I am grateful for any response.
Our little girl slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around, no pets, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattresses.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Take a look at your child when he is sleeping.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to get something out of the stomach?
Or is it with the face in front directly in the mattress?
You can infer from this if everything is okay.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was a walk and if you put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not in use at the moment.
Just to be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply so that the politics of this transmitter is now among all sau.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big bedside tour at the same time.
It has been said that one is an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to "be a running litter barrel column".
What's a man now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A krogman who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How to find all this?
Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I ask for a call back as my supplied wooden table has been delivered defective.
Corps fracture due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and deliver it back in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heating pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or fire stains and dispose of them immediately if present.

In the microwave, heat up to 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first warm-up, slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy outputs can cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your armrest!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.

Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it does not run under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts up despite plugged in power supply.
Then I upgraded the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is there anything else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don’t know how high the seating area is.
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of storage capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to the photo equipment.
This works with two options: once conventionally via the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has come up with different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a lower one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook being tightened.
The second option also fundamentally differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the cover flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take with you not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things safely stay in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer case of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.

Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was given a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you renew the voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but I have retained the damaged piece of furniture and have not sent it back.
And that last year went differently than I thought I couldn’t guess and I just couldn’t redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates the reliability and safety of braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aligned with the balance of the disk according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tinted discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cut-outs improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake slits.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing broccoli in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were cut off, tents opened, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outdo your fellow pioneers in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to house your resources and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional promotions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge slabs, you can use fine-tuning to develop your individual playing style.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates half of the site - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prize-winner turns to a new location and changes the available promotions.
This goes on until the awardee has moved five times, so each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patient:Educators are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other leaders must never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on elimination of the test obligation for three-times vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide waiver of the test obligation for three-times vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation can be waived for three times vaccinated," Klaus Holeschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, told the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Conference of Ministers of Health next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I do that best?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Ups, there has been an error.
Shopping goes through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account information.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing noises/voices, the rarest is seeing images, and the rarest is feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the ablation.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 won’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is, in addition to the legal obligation, also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were only delivering at the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I do not know anyone who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I testify here once my life thanks".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly in European space as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics, over 10 million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was well over 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York wins the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the 11-meter shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook roulades for the first time at New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
It is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#NUMBER#
I was informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
To this day, the money has not gone to me.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas toasts in the Lübeck room
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where in the Lübeck room you can get a Christmas toast.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls allow you to adjust the desired level and the volumetric content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a power reserve when it goes out of your way.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or with direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 footswitch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds on foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the effects that are compatible with it.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I saw it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because she's hanging too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If not, I would also be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then something much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Negotiations
According to Iran, progress has been made in the negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told IRNA on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were continued after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now Bundesland with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1,000 mark at the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute stated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come up with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print this and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that was it, right?
I don’t have to click/indicate/fill in here?
That’s what I want to avoid, so I’m writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a rude thing in my eyes.
It is time for change
###Bundestag you have greeted me, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extistant.
We got into a winter storm and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it like?
For the most part, this is simply due to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone and how we are in general.
In recent days, the impression has been growing that many people here still have a lot of fun on Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundestag is asked who wants to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found a, simply, pile of shards.
After a few rounds, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to once again explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, where we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How are we going to perform outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but which isn’t bad, we’ve got the discord at the end.
If you have the desire and the time, come to the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clobig for this and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also oversized, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet for pickup as much as possible - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long do I have to pay for it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently eats meat very rarely.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately support animal cruelty.
That’s why I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was malice on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was too “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan, you are quickly put in a corner and conflict arises without having to put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Do not deprive your #PRS_ORG# of the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz in Lahnstein City Hall presented a donation notice in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there are constantly increasing stakes: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I’m a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also arms bearers in the executive, I do not want to talk about it anymore!
The question of right and left is always simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in the special uniform and coat of arms, you can attract people right from conservatively magical. I should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course difficult to deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have, of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and even homosexuals are not able to get rid of them (and therefore I do not want them to get rid of them now).
But even these marginal groups represent, even if it sounds strange to me for the first time after a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by excessive left politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks it must be right for them, they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated media and annoys me as well.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign service often start to flatten out due to negative experiences and even sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certain times when right-minded colleagues meet who carry out a vigorous exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so entangled internationally and that is also good enough in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side as well.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
it has been confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available in Germany somewhere.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am independent, very little free time), but for the rest of my life I get it worse than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything lies, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really like “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household simply loses against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more decent with a child?
We don’t have one yet, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no stimulus, it just does not bother me so doll, as long as no visit comes and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the step ensure a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar region increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thereby improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face on the hood increases comfort, seal and durability (separate hood)

Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder?
I have completed a training in software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I increasingly realize that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-confident (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (AVD).
This basically means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told many times that I seem unapproachable (which I think has become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family care, for example.
But I don’t know if the actual working day is really the way I imagine it is, and it’s hard to find anything about it on the internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("already messed up the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I really need to know myself how to do this"/"I'll keep you from working with him less"/"I'll keep him from asking questions"/"
I will probably have the problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it instead.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I am waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, please return!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed breaks down the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up from these in turn its own body proteins, which it also needs for spring formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of feathers in the mauling bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (insert) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe spring damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of spring regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the spring regeneration is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.

Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be felled.
A case application has been submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the statute explicitly states that walnuts are a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo with no use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that, the only question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency notification: Severe traffic accident at Selb

There are injured.
Ah, okay, you understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just contemplating everything that can be contemplated.
Before I get out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-entry.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t call anything more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring for me then and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teacher's office and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn around.
But I am absolutely finished right now.
I have had so little free time over the past month that I am completely exhausted.
It's a holiday now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in those moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that annoy me additionally.
Basically, it’s fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well, as far as feedback and so on is concerned.
But I’m completely dehydrated and wonder how much stress my body can endure before it shuts down completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, I did not find the time to work together for it.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not arrived at the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you have outside advice or ideas, how do I get out of this situation that I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I’m not going to make decisions emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, that’s enough for me at first.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the bitter undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound technology.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances spring.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and warp historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stops, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the final stage determines the tubular character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly captures the behaviour, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of defeats in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory over the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually foldable velcro dividers, it adapts perfectly to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
One possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-stranger things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also the ideal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
La Palma Volcano Eruption: Longest in History
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not anticipate when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the island council's president, Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, told RTVE.
Damage in Millions
In the just three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 residential homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new land tongues with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast due to cold lava.
Particularly important for the island was the banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crisp tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", can be evaded from the rigid routine of living with this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the bestowal.
Previously, gifts were presented on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their window in one night to save them another life in sin.
Out of this unconventional way of giving came the custom popular in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants objected to this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the child of Christ and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of bestowal thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys the few that the custom of St. Nicholas, like the use of Martins with Martinssingen and Martinsumzug, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a cheerful muddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christ child appears on Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is supposed to have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fabled creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it brought frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near London’s Kensington Palace on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who allegedly went to a bank and a bookmaker’s business with a gun.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly thereafter.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative luminaire blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The luminaire is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth splashes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous duration max. 10 hours
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colored inside.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades of color).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself in the daytime.
Its organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger gravel and findlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of pre-work: as a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any power supply or batteries.
Place the “lightstone” in any place exposed to the sun during the day.
Two earth spikes are included to ensure a firm grip if required.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery charges already when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a burgeoning dusk, »Smart Stone« automatically starts to shine; in which color, you decide for yourself: You have the choice of six attractive light colors – in addition to daylight white.
After all, the shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I've done this several times. It doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to keep ordering from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will no longer order in principle.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.
A variablely adjustable PWM clock frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-smooth operation, especially with bell anchor motors – the typical “drumbling” is a thing of the past.
The load control can now be adjusted with up to 10 CVs even in difficult cases.
The unique “autotune” function allows the decoder to be automatically tuned to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder with up to 1.5A motor current provides enough juice even for older engines.

Pill problem
Hello, my dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because I have to take enough medicines due to chronic diseases that I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 during my last about two-year break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of pause, everything has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
Perfume-free and without gums, my cosmetics are already there, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Lovely skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertarian severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne topic.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and I was stuck on sugar, milk and low-carb mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonal is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop looking for something else that is wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague Semina o.ä.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work on the phone in the meantime and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

110-kV ground cable to be re-built in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The plan approval decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the Tann conversion plant in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the freeway near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello, dear colleagues,
I have been in the ref for the summer, teaching is fun, but I currently still have big problems to plan my lessons in the field of geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me actually every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build that (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe I can have a geography teacher on how to work with the book in a timely manner.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already opted for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales disruptions.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the trade association Germany (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of businesses with items of non-daily demand, sales breaks are to be lamented, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It works well only in the food retail as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe business, the chief executive said.
“2G shopping doesn’t take us further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The bandage scheme would have to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores with the tape received on that day.
In addition, in retail, as in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told the "Wirtschaftswoche" (Wirtschaftswoche).
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors, for example, at a central point in the center once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops without interference".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake that has been tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks nasty.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it back.
What do I need to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very light flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or at short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the movie set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the lamp to be remotely controlled in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply by long pressing one of the memory buttons is occupied and finished.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on again the familiar situation is restored - Very convenient for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the ability to operate with favorable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlights continuously with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for mounting, so you can go directly to your photo stand.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of fasteners on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included in the delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a fierce comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a series, the Hessians were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, caught the frustration of a full-grown season start from the soul within a good hour and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today", coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "package praise, to everyone who was involved".
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now still behind their expectations at rank nine.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkuseners 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE-trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly great,” the 27-year-old said, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go ahead step by step and remain modest" and the tasks until the turn of the year "to go through at this level".
The next one is already on the programme on Wednesday during the English week a away match at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 pm, Sky).
I am getting the email that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it divert, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Would then unfortunately mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball before quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany’s handball women slither with hanging heads and empty glances from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB-selection in 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers suffered a severe defeat and must now run against hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said German head coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry to the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Championships on Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, who said: "We have to look forward now."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the touchdown was not up to the level.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 backlash after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-offensive.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly stand up – and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zshocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The only quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Green defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer catch up to a performance increase and left the field as a clear loser.

The title states that I work as a vaccine practitioner in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, among other things, in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed for a large part, I will continue to do so in some of the vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, unless these are related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medication X, this is tolerated with the vaccination....").
In my area of responsibility, the information for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to coronavirus vaccination prescription and there are no reasons to speak against it), the medical documentation and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, which can not (can?) carry out vaccinations, so I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Serious “Huidler” question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a “Huiller”?
With this dialectic response, sent by an Amberger, the BR television show "Wir in Bayern" has given a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unadvised by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "who has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
Then the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably caused a lot of amazement for many Oberpfalzians.
"The skinler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known word of mouth "Houdern".
Which closed an educational gap - probably even with some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Tire selection at the race bike - really so panning safe?
I woke up this morning full of action, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I started riding my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass splitters on the track.
Zack, loud squealing and my rear tire definitely didn't want to go the rest of the way.
Since I did not have a real opportunity to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again with half a bad mood and take the first best train home.
It was not so bad in terms of whimsical, maybe it is better if I do this with the tyre change again before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long stretch over several days ahead of me, I would get extremely ungrateful of this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike I torn down until 14:00 120km!) and who had already described this as suboptimal, because he has been riding with them for several years.
But if I think that after 80-90kms I still have to make a tyre change, then I think I really feel bad :D
Now I had a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be unflattering.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> / tires now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I currently have on the race bike I believe 25x622.
Although it is also available (apparently?) on the Marathon Plus tyres, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tyres in general at a race bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!

After the release of our new high end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get newcomers again.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and is visually reminiscent of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes an appropriately designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no impact on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight increase in pitch.
This is generally customary in the case of widebands in order to optimize the greatly increasing bundling of too high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards, the high pitch range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is measured sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan the corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the base plate at the appropriate place, so that you can carry out the cable there later without problems.
With the aid of an upper milling cutter, the loudspeaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100-6 OHM can later be used flush.
At the rear, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these are now glued the back wall, the cover, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued together.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use finished strips from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a suitable circular saw or a forestry drill.
Then a round milling machine is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off with this.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suck / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it there about 30 cm protruding.
In the upper part of the case, the cable leads to the speaker opening and also lets it hang out there loosely.
The frequency softener is then prepared and used.
The design of the frequency softener, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document:
When the frequency softener is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be connected to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
"Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch, so we’ll be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’re going to do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
