28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone who would want to hurt him, noting, “He finally got things right.”
The body, found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco forensic examination bureau said.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death has been classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, a past chef at a distribution line in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and depressed” by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very much missed,” he said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in hostels, but lately, "He's finally got things going."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to make us some food, to make us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who floated on the stream.
“For all the bad things that happen to this world, it was that unbounded diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone in possession of the information is requested to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Italy’s public debt has risen to record levels
Italy’s national debt in June 2016 exceeded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.248 trillion.
The central bank of the country said that this amount is a historical maximum, reports RIA Novosti.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.

Payments from the airport received 141 victims of the terrorist attack in "Domodedovo".
141 people received charitable payments from the "Aviationny" fund, which was created by the management of the airport "Domodedovo" in order to help the victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to airport spokesman Alexander Vlasov, two more statements are currently under consideration.
"By the Fund continue charitable payments to the victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and there is a comprehensive assistance in solving the existing issues", - added Vlasov, reminding that specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims was created a website of the Fund, containing full information about the procedure of welfare.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years.
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenland sharks’ eye crystals.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a significant role in shark longevity is played by low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals live "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenlandic whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was a little over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest we need not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live so that his health is not destroyed.
These recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it is not necessary to move away from it.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
And most vulnerable to it are people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during a stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to have a vacation with the kids, you don’t have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic physical culture.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, there is usually a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for babies and provide the services of an experienced babysitter.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round holiday in the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to be carried out twice a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main piece of the region of Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, medicinal mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects different systems of the body.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory action, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, bile and diuretic effect.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovska".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salt water because the salts hold the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires adherence to the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the required amount and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of rehabilitation, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salty lake Tambukan, the poaching mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immunomodulatory effect.
These are health walks on individually compiled routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take baths wines, pearls, iodine, selenium, sage and licorice, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
Prolonged fruiting.
What to do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and housekeeper, tells.
High-grown tomatoes it is time to arrange a haircut: remove new grasshoppers, cut poppies, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small bandages - will not have time to mature.
All tomatoes regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed with salt-superphosphate hood, processed with biopreparations (the grower - to accelerate the infusion and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Hamair, Bactophyte - from diseases, Immouli
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer should be used only copper cooper, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-plated cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, watered with warm water and Zircon solution, sprinkle the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolonging the fruiting of the zucchini is also not difficult: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, sprinkle the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect from the night cold, install a bow with a covering material over the bed.
During the day, keep the plants open, and after sunset close.
Signs of the end.
What does it mean that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest-running recession in 20 years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, Russia’s GDP shows a positive dynamic – in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was also recently announced by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
There is a slow growth ahead.
According to the experts of the CBI, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russia’s GDP indicates that the recession is behind, and ahead – the slow growth of the economy,” – says in the Bulletin of the Bank of Russia “What the trends are saying”.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline of the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline amounted to 0.2% to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of the Mayor of RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom has been crossed.”
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, a revival of business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the year is a leap year, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
We will add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transports, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index stood at 7.2%, compared with 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, over the past two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year has strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, there has been an increase in the volume of industrial production in Russia.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics are also demonstrated by the situation on the labour market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labor market, the issue of real disposable income of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor can slow the recovery of the economy, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth can also be called the strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best way to affect the real sector.
The negative factor is also the insufficiently high level of investment, which inhibits the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow to -0.5% versus -3.7% in 2015," says Irina Rogova, an analyst at GK Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and the former foreigners speak, then in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a large number of Russians stand under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone believed that the best conditions for development in sport would be created abroad.
AiF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Red.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose jumps with a sixth.
If she remained in Russia, she would hardly have been able to "lift from the throne" Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only one of us, albeit a former, in the jumping sector with a sixth.
Her best achievements in this sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the 2016 Continental Championship silver, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelistic direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children grew up in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in the struggle while still in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Combat Training Center continued classes under the guidance of another former Russian Vladislav Izbojikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
At the World Cup that same year, it was a win.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 World Cup.
After that, there were 2013 bronze and 2014 silver.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There, Mary continued her studies.
Soon she was already part of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America its indicators are a ceiling.
The new name, which in Russian sounds strange, Kristina Shaldybina received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl art gymnastics over the ocean.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - she brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former "artists" is Yana Berezko-Marggrander, who stands for the German national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, only this time a sportswoman - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration paths of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - especially coming to his homeland, so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multiplayer.
There is very little information about Maria Ukolkova’s swimmers in the Russian information space.
For a very long time Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - was even the country's record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th in the integrated 4<0xC3><0x97>100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparation for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavurta managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, a champion of Russia, a master of sports of the Russian international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships – Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his homeland than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was quite small.
It was there that Michael began to practice sports gymnastics.
He has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualifiers in parallel races.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronous swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter stands for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croyter also won the gold medal at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumps.
The 31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who after long speeches for Russia has decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sportsmanship of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the Soviet volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue a career in Italy.
The family also stayed there for permanent residency.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and fell with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but this northern country failed to get there - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to learn free struggle.
He soon won the Junior World Championships and later qualified for the Olympic Games as well.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Freeva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently playing for the Spanish national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to achieve high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
By the statute of failures in the national team, Timuraz made the decision to change the sports citizenship.
The last in our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Machachkale, - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to box.
Since then, Arthur has been a three-time champion of Canada, and in 2012 he became a youth world champion.
In 2015, Bijarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "Cassacs should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least from 7 years of age understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But for now, I think this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take in all the positives that have accumulated before, on a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If all goes well and it is not known how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
HQ continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an attacker on the funds allocated to the needs of the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing sector.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor’s office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (by placing cold water) were put 4 million rubles. for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And such examples in the country of mass.
The people give the last money for the communal, and pay correctly, - according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused of several articles of the Criminal Code at once: waste, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, works on them were not actually carried out, but were paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent them for his needs.
As a result of the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov’s machinations is, unfortunately, typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the uk, who appropriated the money of citizens, has swept through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kochan, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatskiy region, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the UC, two others played the role of settlement centers, that is, took money from the population.
However, to the energetics A. Kochan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, a loved one.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Things don't get excited, they're delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - says Svetlana Rzavotneva, executive director of the NP "ZKH Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on housing issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to the right of residence in universities.
The refusals to initiate criminal cases, the jailbreaks in the course of the investigations are also mentioned in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes in production in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
The rest of the investigation was lengthy and one in five was suspended because the accused had not been identified.
Often the shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed by them to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigative bodies are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
In the five months of the current year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of the residents?
This means: the change of management of the house, financial and other issues go by the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that the market of housing and utilities can not penetrate normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population.
It turns out, residents in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property, is convinced.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
It’s not just a one-off action, it’s a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, not in all regions is such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital and does not smell scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government has shown iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Ekvolny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, and the legislative amendments, and the legal enlightenment.
The management companies are under close supervision, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in public space (both residents’ appeals and response measures are posted on the government portal of Moscow).
Many do not simply pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is maintained.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the validity of tariffs on housing and utilities - because a large part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Perhaps all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is everything against the will of the local authorities?
Maybe it’s worth changing your job?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to renounce his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the United States, offering to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the Americans to abandon their support for the “fethullahist terrorist organization.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing more and more and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FETO).
Either a FETO coup or a democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," Erdogan's appeal, which was issued Wednesday evening in Ankara, was quoted as saying by the Anatolian Agency.
The Turkish president once again, but has already demanded more harshly from the United States to fulfill his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the uprising.
Recall that on the night of July 16, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims to its address, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The last statement of representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey – he insists on his own and also makes demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels announces a date for the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkey's Minister of EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel called on Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa relief with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Another provocative statement <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish foreign minister has not ruled out that the country will consider leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere, they import missiles," <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we started looking for others," he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks to Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now leading his game and can not go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He is very attached to the West both in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining framework relations with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see in this post a completely obedient person," - explained AIF.ru expert.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensation, about the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressured.
“Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of managing the country and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes beneficial to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance on Russia and in every way sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think that Erdogan entered a period of human-night diplomacy.
Turning up between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which with its help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert said.
Anna Glazova, the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, holds a different view.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis in relations will aggravate, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to relaunch policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by chance that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, there is an active political interaction with Iran," - said Yevgeny Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is currently pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
“It was at that time that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively with zero problems with its neighbours.
There have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both on the regional and international arenas," the expert said.
Glazova believes that returning Turkey to its previous relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, now the question is whether the EU will start responding harshly to Turkey, which could open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young doctors’ strike: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new labor contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Younger doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the deal on a labor contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to "persistently remain silent" on issues that she said led to the denial of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for official renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the junior doctors of the BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take, during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially declare an end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” to Mr Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm presupposes the opposite.
But the prolonged cooling coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outrageous.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have carried out a staggering, total offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks should be held responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Mr Erdogan’s own family had acquired illegal trade in oil from areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The amount fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will of course feel relief when flights are finally resumed.
They are at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the newspaper Vedomosti said.
But the visit also had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for considering it a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her protracted dissatisfaction with the tortoise-like pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move — which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually break Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this glittering seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they have not even touched on this topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to Disappear for Customers Outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and one that our staff will be busy with because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“This is a good time for us to move a bank of brands, because basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs, not our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Franky Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory in Newmarket at the Affair
Detectors spray champagne after a double in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track – the Addiction trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggot, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
Three-time Jockey Champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because that is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unobtrusive.
Detectors Accept Applause When Leading Predisposition After Victory
The two jockeys achieved this mark in obstacle racing: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark that so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical smear that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have led 6,000 winners if he hadn’t been just a jockey for the weekend and big races!
And seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character that’s good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Franky Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid jump from the horse
From rapid finishes to rapid jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
These were ups and downs.
A number of big-race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori had previously said he would like to continue competing at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as an environmental and transport representative.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not state the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he was the head of the president’s protocol and government apparatus, according to the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being carried out.
Putin told one Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are Smiles Convinced?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration had resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it convinced few here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that a man once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It’s true that in early 2012, I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult post, even, you might say, problematic post, for four years.
Well, it turns out, I was the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
"Thinking like a criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with a producer
Gibson was a sledgehammer at a Los Angeles show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative discrepancies in the shots and differences of opinion.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darm and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love 'Think Like a Criminal' and have invested my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be present in it to the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
The show is set to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mysteries: the fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could have been sandbags left by the water tide.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a shot of this spectacle in Periskop in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern span and viaduct Queensferry Crossing—meaning the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the "cloth veers", which are now approaching completion near all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridge walls.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing engineering of truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the loop between the viaduct and the bridge face is a virtual operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosyth today, which means that all the canvas is ready for the lift to the bridge site.
Michael Martin, Project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first loop on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this loop is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the Northern Pile, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern side - or facing the coast - side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scalable, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Elegant, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were "lucky to stay alive" after they were ejected from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men tried their best to get to a safe place while their ship continued on its way.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said steering lifeboat Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found stranded and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken aboard a shore lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it somehow broke away from the man driving the boat when it tipped over.
Someone's been protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a deserving hunt for health and happiness
It’s exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at the screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the fervent passion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (later spawned a series of cartoons, game cards, and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this lost its former relevance just before this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokemons that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be ‘photographed’ (through a screenshot on your phone) or ‘captured’.
The generation that played the game when they were younger, joined the vicious passion, breaking away from the sofas to search for.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an “ordinary” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people tracked by it who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health care campaigns that persuade people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have found no response because most health care messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a long list of benefits that are too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out onto the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms that are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might bump into the door.
Well, what's that?
There's been a breakthrough.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone apps such as Fitbit could have tracked our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason for classes, as this game gives.
The novelty will fade, and use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Byles wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the fuss.
Simone Byles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamics on the base jump.
Unforced on the raft.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion of the absolute championship on Thursday, placing the chasm between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was enough away from the silver medalist and teammate of the "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Byles from the United States performs on a gymnastic heel during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of absolute champion and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She wept when she was shown her final overall score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Byles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Championship medals—including 10 golds—with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One final test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between the Byles and others in the field, but between it and the load of overexpected expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simona Byles of the United States, on the left, and Elie Reisman are hugged after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the Women's Individual Absolute Gymnastics Championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Martha Carroll.
While Byles insisted that she had never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, it wasn’t quite so.
Part of her free exercise program — the one that includes her signature pass — is set to Latin American music, which would fit right in the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, being a beginner walking child and discovered by the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single championship since the summer of 2013 – a strip of luck that has to last as long as Bales wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina obtained a small advantage with the help of two rotations, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics and free exercise—where Byles defends the title of world champion—are ambushed.
She came forward again with 15,433 on the ankle and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riceman gently hugged her as they waited for the final count—pure formality—and tears appeared around the shiny red with the white and blue eyeliner of Byles, when the idea she once recorded in the cut-out album came true.
Riceman's performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she shared a third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina at the Tai-Break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call "grandmother," was well ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered in return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Byles, the viral tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the deadliest attack in the first Phoenix serial killer case in a decade, were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide is apparently not the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallet or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check if it had been linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, said earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were interrelated and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told police there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report of the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixievto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixievto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which, in fact, is not true - of course you subscribe to it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were doing that anymore,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund didn’t sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn’t speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him the language of gestures,” Pixievto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual language of gestures — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zika virus.
Pixie recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don’t expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixievto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rain expected to fall on the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from the shores and are at risk of widespread flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for transportation for high-water, boats and sandbags were being received.
Steele said that the arrival of Tanjipahoa alone asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The flood threat remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could spill into the area.
In southern Alabama, waiting for the flooding was on duty until Friday, as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Ammit River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, are forecast to set a flood record over the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood going downstream in the parish of Assenshen is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flooding in Ammit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepmother were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another stepmother, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest influx she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said that he and all his family members have a disability and he is the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltering on Friday.
Crowtmann says the flood is "rapidly spreading" as the rains continue, noting officials are considering an evacuation order.
Crowtmann says an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rain from Wednesday.
Heavy rains and flooding of the streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in the Tanjipahoa parish and to cancel classes in five school districts, authorities said.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa’s adviser told of 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooding.
President Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets found in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to welcome those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the parish of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and bags of sand were available for delivery to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said City Governor Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the covert rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amyt, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," said Tawson, "and it is still pouring down to the ground."
Mahesh Brown, 6, "Released by Bullets", Remains Alive After Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting of a 6-year-old boy in the city this week.
The child's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds including his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got very sick, his little body was fired with bullets,” his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in hospital in a critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He had to go to first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims have been reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The guilds of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various examples of semi-automatic weapons, have set the scene.
It seems to have been a long battle.
There were sleeves on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting," said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly looking through CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old boy, a girl, was shot in the arm Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Lori
That’s what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Elie Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It also reinforced the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed her.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simona Byles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected, yet virtuoso, gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American woman in a row to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And her teammate, Eli Riceman, earned the silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastic sections across the country.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of training for Martha Carroll.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, uniform, fees for participation in competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts).
Most of these gym clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most out of their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, Simona Byles’ coach, and Maggie Hani, Lori Hernandez’s coach, have both been training their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls’ communities inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young guys (mostly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that is great.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women’s Power in winning the team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger Doctors Announce Further Strikes After Denying Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended contract with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activity at night and weekends to improve overtime service.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The VMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And it's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April delayed about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nursing appointments, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended contract with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants a better weekend payment for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "Stops achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that the continued positive contribution to other important topics — such as the distribution of staff, flexibility of training, additional training for those who return after a break in career, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences — were the result of the work.
The drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities have recommended giving it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service’s NICE Surveillance Service has advised giving it to people for four years to further rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE Supervision Service of the UK National Health Service has advised giving it to people for four years to further rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to approximately 140,000 people in England annually, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks in pieces, it can cause a thrombus to block blood access to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it will be able to move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making the thrombus less likely.
The draft NICE manual, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke occurs – often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of a person’s life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Preliminarily recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the flourishing of vote-counting falsifications in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving as a boost to the government’s report.
A culture of political correctness has blinded the eyes, resulting in widespread vote-counting falsification in Muslim communities, according to the government’s devastating report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is stunned by criticism of police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
A former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police must be allowed to set boundaries outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to specify their name and address.
The report even proposes to apply non-washable ink to people’s fingers when they submit their ballots, in order to rule out that someone could vote twice.
We need to provide better protection for whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was commissioned on Downing Street following a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that mayor Luftur Rahman had to be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "led his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of the faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of a persona when a person votes by presenting himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the mail vote, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly putting pressure on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
His report said: "Evidence has been presented of the pressure exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ about ethnicity and religion.”
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with ballot papers to stop “harvesting votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for stringent checks on registration to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use unwashed ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks of people’s nationality to make sure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaigners and activists from working with filled in absentia ballots and mail-voting envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around the polling stations.
To amend the law to facilitate the presentation of accusations of intimidation to people under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Illegal photography in polling stations.
To require that only English be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric vehemently attacks the city police, saying it was “astonishing” that no criminal charges had been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court examining election issues has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt – the criminal standard of proof – on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the ineffective “check-ins” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threatens this good reputation.
Crazy about the bicycle analogue of Kate and other doubles of the Olympics celebrities in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prévo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn’t the only athlete struggling for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double — at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians with more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. archer’s men’s team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the double Kate on the bike path, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be a twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men’s archer team, was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after images of it appeared that looked frighteningly similar to the Wolf star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer learned about the social media madness and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe except for vegetation on the face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Razerford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Ali Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be the exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of Hor Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "The Beginning"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova can boast not only of the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, is similar to the "sports version of Joseph Gorgo".
Survy Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his enthusiasm that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linnaeus, as well as gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile.
Olympic commentator on CBC apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's freestyle 4x200 m upset on Wednesday CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a smell” and “died like a pig” during the flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
One could hear MacDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentator team to "dilute her with color," say, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman threw the ball, baby."
Too excited, started out like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan sailed the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 – by 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Audiences across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Really, the CBC spokesperson just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’????”
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese threw the ball, baby".
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit by Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Nothing to #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald’s comment, saying, “We apologize for the comment about the swim performance getting aired.”
It was a bad choice of words, we’re sorry it happened.”
SVS ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald's
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The network also hurried to apologise and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
“Last night we acted swiftly to apologise to our live viewers and our followers on social media.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on a person.
"I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her in person."
“It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.”
Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman was naked to try on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried what she looked like in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually discarded four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkstone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkstone, where a woman tried knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after putting on her underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, “People couldn’t believe what they saw.”
Standing in the middle of the hall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a secluded place to do it — she just stood there, shameless.”
"Everybody got tired when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she would like, dressed again and walked out.
“It doesn’t seem like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought about the person who would eventually buy those panties that she was trying.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is going to take home panties that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been posted.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I’m concluding that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from the sale after she left — well, even better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find out that another woman put them on and took them off and they weren’t postponed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkston on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using Cow-Magic
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a magistrate of the Wizarding Cow Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approaching you in front or behind, this video will show you how to hit a robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a barrel and go back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For an armed, suitable front, the way of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and unscrew it so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip, before retreating back and aiming at it.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how the Misters do it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master of magic — is to give your cash back.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright guides his language to the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler has put his immune system and vomiting reflex to the test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The host and author of the travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, conducted a speech on the euro banknote, the perils of Circus Piccadilly, a toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is to become a film called “The Guide to the Traveler-Lysun on the Inner Force,” has yielded some amazing results.
The thought of licking a wash button on a train that thousands of others are using can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip across Europe, Wright talked to doctors and nurses about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his gut, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at stations to the toilet flush button, this task undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said: ‘From childhood I was completely careless about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.’
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test smear demonstrated a luminometer value exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while just washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a film about a traveler called “The Traveler-Lizon’s Guide to Inner Strength,” which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the film, he said: 'It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
"The Guide of the Traveler-Lisun to the Inner Force" was filmed together with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at Valio, Niko Wourenmaa said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier for Janu to lick, and some were quite hard.
I’m glad that some of these lickings we managed to shoot on film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents associated acid-milk bacteria exclusively with good stomach and gut conditions, and 58 percent said they consume, at least occasionally, foods containing added acid-milk bacteria.
The family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornwall, on the eve of the eviction
The hooligan family left their <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 municipal home after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcoca were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the pavements were opened, the rubbish was scattered on the floor and the walls were sprinkled with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he might not be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live that way.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
The couple have three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, and spoofing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old rubbish
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past have been pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner's home this week after they were granted an 11-week extension for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, ‘They didn’t care about anyone.’
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and in addition regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the town hall
He added: "It is a shame that the landlord was unable to accept any responsibility for the conduct of her and her family, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case because the behavior was limiting, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some consolation to the neighbours and send a signal that asocial behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all just over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of rubbish that surround the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as weights, related belongings and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for the tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were sprinkled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecution's charge, as well as those who are harming such behavior," she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to sunbathe in the sun were terrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was conducting a training flight, but insisted that there was no risk to safety.
This is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane spied over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The occupants hovered on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flight on social media, said: “He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed like he was going to crash.”
Nuno Arroza added, “I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were horrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was conducting a training flight with the aim of detecting fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - dense fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility.
The plane was conducting a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been mandatory for general catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as food companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rospotrebnadzor’s business checks on compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are issuing fines only for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation in general will cost the company 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP as a system that takes risks into account when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food security for the astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on the territory of the TS.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business had 4 years (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the technical regulation of the TS in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials acknowledge that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurateurs,” said Elena Tsereteli, head of the Public Council.
Now everyone is trying to recover what was lost.
The expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a stirring demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government requesting that charters be allowed now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea most of the accommodation facilities have already been booked until the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of the charter carriages
According to the North-Western regional office of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry (RST), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be renewed until there is no, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly develop programs and agree with airlines on the necessary direction on board," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-Western Regional Office of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not greatly affect the distribution of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or vacation in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are mainly purchased by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is not necessary to count on excitement - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the excitement is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, the launch of the charters now is a rehearsal for next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for next season,” said Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of statutory compensation payments within the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by damage or other damage to health.
The delivery of milk to workers employed at work with harmful working conditions according to established norms is provided for in Article 222 of the Russian Civil Code.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of extradition are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
On the basis of these norms, the FNS of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2, paragraph 3, Article 217 of the NCA of the Russian Federation, incomes in the form of the value of milk issued to workers in the conditions of actual employment are exempted from the NDFL.
Moscow’s Gazstroybank has been left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations with the credit organization Shareholder Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC "GAZSTROYBANK" carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the creation of grounds for the credit institution to implement measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in the conduct of questionable transit operations.
The bank appoints a temporary administration for the period until the appointment of the contest manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
AO AKB "GAZSTROYBANK" is a participant in the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1,4 million rubles in total.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, the assets of JSC GAZSTROYBANK as of August 1, 2016 were 335th in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Died in Syria
Kadisa Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only benefit of all this - as a tombstone and a testament to others, that these are precisely the risks involved when traveling to a war zone - is to convince people to ever make the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed Says Clinton Will Remain Loyal to Garland as Supreme Court Candidate in Case of Election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's approval, but how President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will pick Garland “with some degree of confidence.”
Reed later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "scratch the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who are blocking Garland’s nomination are “cowboys” and “helpers” to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says erotic calendars for ‘women as well as men’
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to unveil the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it’s a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Mosquitoes will be given memoirs about unscrupulous online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and the legal basis, the rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memory is being worked out so far.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to the Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Detained persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia, who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panov Yevgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtey Andrei Romanovich.
“They all give confessional testimony,” the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of Zaporozhye region Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, confessed to his guilt at the interrogation.
FAS fines Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violating antitrust legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said Alexey Dotsenko, deputy head of FAS.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones, which are sold in Russia, the Google Play app store only on the condition that other applications of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Art. 10 <0xC2><0xA7> 1 "On the protection of competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The law "On protection of competition" must be respected by all companies, whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, head of the FAS Russia's Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Office.
The agency suspects in the conspiracy of 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The New Book Stores Network has been fined for selling Stace Kramer’s book “50 Days Before My Suicide,” the Moscow City News Agency reported.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostankino district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the administration of Rospotrebnadzor.
A source in The New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that in the largest book stores in Moscow, checks are being carried out on the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow will be held the evening of the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow will be held the evening of memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literators.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember it in their homeland," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
For the evening invited close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Evgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of Pushkin Irina Antonova GMII, the director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Pejenskyy, the head of the Department of Culture of Moscow Alexander Kiyman.
Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to hold a panichide on the sculptor in New York, presumably, until August 14.
The end user of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
And while you haven’t given up on clogging up the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym Not AllLonely MenMiddle Ages, this statement stems from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the plates is due not to a boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate the novelty of the material object, but to the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of amateur gatherings – it has an emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a TV news reportage, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of bustling Soho Street, wearing a modest gray suit and squeaking violently before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, “Yeah, look at that.”
All right, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores have now filled buildings once occupied by independent sellers – several music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, in which I am close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, I followed from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for a half-day to meet, and walk by.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn’t follow him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles partly stems from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and buy items he sold when he was young and on the loose.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink very much.
That's my shortcoming.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match YouGov’s profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of the media noise, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records,” he said.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revival characters of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plates?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that the record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Ueza, some older customers, in particular, are being insulted by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to constantly move away from familiar envelopes for records, items that awaken memories of relentless youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material things as a kind of reassurance,” Uze says.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
This is an easy way to get your head up.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plate rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50 percent of people who bought a vinyl album last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don’t have a record player.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably look seriously puzzled, a leafy shelf with Bosanov’s collections.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men) noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,’” he says.
It’s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the product, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little under twenty, who only get to know this.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples who are over 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores — the latest synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation — it breaks through the columns — it’s nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not the money.
She does not earn much, according to her, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." - she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh of love.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban fashionistas.
While I’m creating the illusion that I’m looking at jeans-only shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is set by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, obligatory plates for any medium collection.
No one is looking—perhaps because they are just ornaments, some so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for a while yet, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the huge numbers of women collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work at all in school or offices.
But they clearly don’t spend Thursday morning strolling through the record shops on Berwick Street, flipping the records and avoiding the gaze of a nasty 30-year-old fake host hanging over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark is the longest-living vertebrate animal
Scientists say the Greenland polar shark has the highest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, the Kale authorities said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 home-made shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to shave or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) in a single dish.
The prefecture of Calais said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
Lilla’s court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people running 72 home-made shops, but said the problems of Calais “were fully understood.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely turbulent conditions.”
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book children's cafe at the camp, which works non-profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years."
Two charities, Relief for Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people at Jungle Camp has risen to more than 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young libertarians to cognition programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Trainer.
The programs are aimed at children’s audiences, so most will take place in game form.
Today, August 10, the Library-Branch No. 2, in the linear microdistrict, invites to the cruise presentation "My town is small".
On August 11 in the library branch No. 1 will be held the local time "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the library branch No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "The land of the native past fate".
And in the library-branch No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the boys from the northern microdistrict, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Fyscult-hello!".
Britain stops at silver in rugby-7 after Fiji’s master class allows them to take gold
The impressive UK series in Rugby 7 was crushingly halted on the final hurdle by Fiji’s team in the final on Thursday night when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master class on possession of the ball, distributing, evading, supporting the game, running lines and the brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the same day, could have come back to negatively affect them in the final.
But, despite everything, Fiji in this form won as well as a team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is astonishing.
Fiji started out brilliantly, for the fun of repelling Britain's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuvay added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the United Kingdom barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell prevented mountain man Leon Nacarava from scoring a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
This led to a 29-0 break.
It seemed as if Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which is to a large extent so.
The UK made massive substitutions halfway through the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good, until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton caught the attempt for Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game had long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William decorated a Fiji cake, which did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
Whispered, the Fijis hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the United Kingdom slightly overtook South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt each – the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some magnificent legwork broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, the 15-year-old brother of England's team, Anthony, secured victory - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach fight against cancer
There won’t be any more exciting gold in these games, and that’s saying something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the paddles, in this boat there were three voices, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always so long as they aspired to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, once again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swan, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold row a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to the gradually growing victories that matter, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would survive to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December of 2013.
The trio were fortunate to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The ridge itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, an artillery regiment captain with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: “I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it’s a little too much, but it means so much.”
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so does Robin.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
"Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for the best partner for training or the best coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm to which their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen said, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is very important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t try to do something amazing.
We didn’t wait for the fireworks today, we just waited for us to be able to do well and come out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a year for the couple to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at her wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
Government Extends Destruction of Sanctions Products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of foodstuffs prohibited for import into Russia.
The corresponding resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo on countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been extended several times, now it is in effect until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from the sale.
Hunting for the "Prohibition"

The WTO’s panel of arbitrators found that Russia’s import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization’s rules.
The import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia,” it said in a statement on the organization’s official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which has introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S. conduct in resolving disputed issues at the WTO undermines the principles of the organization's discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of the Americans to approve for the second term of the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the administration of the President has changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed the head of his own administration of former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino.
Vladimir Putin has carried out reshuffles in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino said during the meeting that he considers important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as the head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts believe the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the relocation will not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who worked in the administration of the president for a long enough time, effectively built the activities of the AP has left.
In his place came the deputy head of administration Anton Weino - a man who knows perfectly the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they are allowed not to buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years, gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive to it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice president of the Polish finance company Boguslaw Mazec.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (at Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," Majets said.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish Antimonopoly Office did not agree to the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Earlier this month, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas on Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the board of the holding.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not yet plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the board of the company.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year the Poles only increased by 42% of gas purchases from the Russian Federation.
Zampred Gazprom added that the very fact of submitting the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The representative of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure Petro Naimskiy said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Petro Naimski, Poland’s government commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, said his country could abandon its supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two strands of the sea gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to a question from journalists, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security are not recorded there.
Observers tracked what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport, which rolled out of the 400m runway and crashed on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The emergency occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
Krasavia's flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates as usual.
The Volga investigative department on the transport of the SCR began to find out the reason for the rigid landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy on Syria Stefan de Mistura considers the fact of what happened to be undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in Geneva at the end of August.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
At the time, the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aviation dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw-in.
The Russian Defense Ministry later accused the opposition group "Kharakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinka" of what happened.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the eyes started to burn, it became difficult to breathe," the witness said.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy on Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the removal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The organization’s current three-hour day-to-day truce regime is “insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelann, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to deliver help and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city.
“We have to send bulk cargoes from a column of trucks in the area where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined,” said Mr. Egelann. - But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table. "
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia on August 11 announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will operate daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to reverse the military operation and promote the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand, four people died.
Several explosions erupted in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 others were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions hit the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s interior ministry has hurried to say that the Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organising the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country's military leaders.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Chrisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the targets, he added, but the Interior Ministry of the country "is convinced that they are not affiliated with international extremist groups."
“It is too early to draw conclusions,” said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for certain that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local sabotage, and we are trying to identify the identity of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithichi Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees in the bustling streets filled with dining in restaurants tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was a street food trader.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch subjects, two Italian citizens and a citizen of Austria.
Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturism said.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission for the drafting of a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament is fully appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the prime minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country’s army commander, Prayut Chan-Ocha.
According to him, the army has been hit by a continuing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced a curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 the introduction of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions that injured 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions produced unknowns on motorcycles.
Authorities intensified security measures in the capital and drew in military forces to protect protesters.
In the Dry Log, the development of conditions began.
As it became known, the government was asked to agree on the draft auction terms for the Sukhoi Log gold field with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25% and more belong to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of the state.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft of the order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation said.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has confirmed that the project has been submitted to the government.
A representative of the vice-premier, Alexander Khloponin, who oversees the subsoil use, told "E" that the official's apparatus had not yet received the project.
“The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government’s order, and given the deadline for collecting applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held as early as October,” - said in the Ministry of Natural Resources.
According to "<0xD0><0xA3>", the project has retained two key requirements for potential participants, written in the version that was sent for coordination to the ministries and FOIVs in July (there is one at "<0xD0><0xA3>").
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants at least 25% of the state.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on ininvestments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft of the FZ, as already written "<0xD0><0xA3>" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Sukhoi Log refers to federally significant sub-dramas (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for public participation in the capital of the participants of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, spoke in December 2015 to the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergey Poroshenko.
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give up control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya stated that foreigners "can go to a consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The interlocutors of the “U” consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polyus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostekh".
As wrote "<0xD0><0x95>", in July the partners created SP "SL Zoloto", where "Polys" has 51% of the shares, the structure of "Rostekh" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, and Pole said they were “certainly interested in this asset” and had all the necessary skills and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the statement said.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the government of the Russian Federation, the sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets on Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "U", are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, estimated “U” investments in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are frightening not only the volume of investment, but also the complexity of the project: we need serious advance exploration of stocks and technologies working with complex ores, explain the interlocutors of "U" in the industry.
On the pension market, the largest M&A transaction - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" started the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of "Gas Fund Pension Savings" will be created NPF with a volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure of the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofund", "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension Savings" - yesterday, the owner of the 100% funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"The reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement not to deteriorate the terms of the existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of Gazfund Pension Savings.
As noted by the general director of this NPF, Oleg Bialoshitsky, the association of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate management.
According to him, the indicative period for the completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, Gazfund Pension Savings will become the largest player in the PPP market.
According to March 31, the amount of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
According to the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
Thus, the group controlled by O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems," noted Nikolai Sidorov, NPF Future Director.
Active work on consolidation of funds from April is also going on in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Region Fund" should join the NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the NPF “Confidence”.
"The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs," Safmar said.
The pause in the pooling of funds, which was sustained by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, can be caused by several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively positioned.
Since the amendments to the ECB’s resolution in March of this year, there are no longer any such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the whole issue can be bought by one major player," - says the director of the group of ratings of financial institutions of AKRA Yuri Nogin.
Several of the NPF’s top 15 asset managers call another possible cause of the pause the division of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in a single fund that the group’s owners had to agree on.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
Gazfond also did not respond to the “U” request in the NPF.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, at a long distance this decision will be justified.
According to Sergey Okolesnov, CEO of the consulting company Pension Partner, Gazfonda Pension Savings has fewer outflows, the accession will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofund" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, considers the Managing Director of Corporate Ratings "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing the duplication functions will clearly override the possible costs for the merger," Mitrofanov said.
The costs for the merger of four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The costs for the maintenance of four such funds amount to about 400 million rubles. per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget can be reduced realistically by half", - Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
In the Russian rental went the best Disney movie "Pete and his dragon".
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a compassionate dragon, soulful history and country-style songs are enough to once again believe in old-fashioned magic, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened child was picked up by the dragon, who became a human infant and a tender babysitter, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in catch-up and falls asleep in the embrace.
Six years later, he had grown up and in a ragged bandage, and could no longer be distinguished from another clever woodpecker, Mowgli.
In this way, Pete discovers a red-haired female gamer Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while Gavin's (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively destroys the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete goes through an accelerated course of “being human” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, moral code in their hearts, and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horrible for the viewer to really start hating or fearing him.
Even Gavin, who hunted an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be a scary one, with a good bulldog's muzzle, an airliner's wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon sneezes funny, murmurs, even snores and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to starve, it is advantageously different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults begin to cry in the three streams desperately.
Surprisingly good and underage Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously gives out a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie "Dragon Pete", mediocre from nose to tip of tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
No other way than a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are music tracks on board and most of the weird jokes.
This good tale reads the features borrowed from "Bambi", "The Alien" and many other sweet hearts of children's paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "Jungle Book", and there is no skilled villain as Kate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of stepmother in the new "Zolushka".
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magical castle director Lowry will receive once again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story about "Peter Pan".
Worked in "Pete and His Dragon" tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project about an immature boy by the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be presented with a new indictment
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found shortcomings in their case.
That the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting the access to the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor's office," RBC quoted lawyer Olga Dinze as saying.
She said the prosecutor's office had pointed out to investigators that the suitability of the case and the collected materials were inconsistent.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new indictment.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, clarifies Ms. Dinze.
According to E, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the RBC journalist's accusations of "distorting the political situation towards instability" and "suppressing power illegally".
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, had lunch in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life here is freezing for a second.
Even at night.
The final starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village is carried out without stopping, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations are stretching in one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which we were located, consider it exemplary - it was put into operation as one of the first and showed all the checks
The problem with the hot water, then, sorry, with the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners began to come, but only stuffed with some substance on the floor, and everything.
They have floors, you see, some innovative ones.
Mol, you can't wash them humanely.
Let us know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, we have achieved a change of cleaning company and now everything is OK with it.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area surrounded on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the entire perimeter, along which the machine-gunners walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are apparently the most urgent for the domestic team.
At the check-in counter there are two advertisements: printed "Please do not throw paper into the toilet!" and from the hand "I accept the gift badges.
The stand itself drowns in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Reminder on infectious diseases for those leaving for Rio de Janeiro", "First aid in drowning, getting a foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiac arrest".
The text inside is, in general, encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by a fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the national team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
On the other hand, the medical center is actually the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "Despite everything, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
They only believe in those who fear.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even more spirit lifting, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the proto-priest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev.
Order prayer and other needs can be made by phone...
In general, there is a center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all denominations.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping collaborators of the new cleaning company.
I guess in the readiness at any moment to throw on washing innovative floors they decided to arrange themselves a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I had a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his teacher, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Complaining about the big account is not for nothing, - shares the impressions of the well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live in two, the beds, of course, almost costly, but it is uncritical.
The bathroom is one on four, but spacious.
The closet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not cause confidence, but things can be put.
"No, well you pretend, they have no tea!" - Svetlana Kuznetsova, a tennis player, greeted by me in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it represents a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive at the same time 5,000 visitors.
Here, 60 thousand servings per day are given out on the mountain for free.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchens of the world", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I looked at it, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - surprised Kuznetsova. - No tea!
It's good that I brought the Chinese with me, the soldering iron.
And a kettle.
But in general, to let you know, we have even worse food on the courts.
At least something can be chosen here, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose a steamed cod and fries in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well
I don’t even understand why this queue is always at the local McDonald’s.
Satisfied, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Tricked cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provocative, you might say.
To receive a gift, you must correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But she didn't attack him.
In other words, I was in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation has already worsened on the second question: "If I have received a notification of passing the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I stopped at option B: "No - I have one hour."
I lost, so to speak, my vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to wait for WADA to relax.
In general, it is necessary to appear immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
I somehow thought that if I’m going to have a hard time following a balanced diet because of my dense schedule (and I’m, by the way, hard!), then I can use bio-additives to get “additional nutrients to boost my productivity.”
Anne, no, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but urgently, in several sentences respond.
WADA is playing this unfairly!
How are you doing, Russia? - the leading quizzes ask mockingly.
To retreat nowhere - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our bloodless team.
That’s why I focused and won the unfortunate T-shirt from the last effort.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I took to the fitness center next door.
I'm interested in the simulator count.
It went down to 250.
Surprisingly, he noted that no Russian athlete was found in this tumultuous runway.
But maybe it's right?
Let those who can't play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line for the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever the spit, there is a device for the issuance of condoms.
There is an inspiring cry on it: "Celebrate with a condom!"
Then it remains only to twist the iron, resembling the handle of the door lock, and the condom, made of natural latex Amazonia, readily falls out of the apparatus.
I took one, in memory.
There will be no shortage of athletes - they brought them 450,000.
Just for a festive and festive time in the Olympic Village there is an entire entertainment center.
Next to it, there is a sign that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in different ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is this? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses a savage toy.
You could, of course, just say that you do not want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian national team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes ripples from the guys in yellow-blue.
The most important team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you are walking, and not driving on electric cars, you will open a photo of the house of the Canadian national team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry room, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a store with everyday goods.
And late in the evening, you will, obese, sit next to an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you'll be under the accompaniment of a machine, messy spraying liquid to kill insects, thinking about eternal.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, real fans went to the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglassova won gold in rap at the XXXI Olympic Games, I received first.
I may even be the only Muscovite to see this happen, except for those who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs - as always at nighttime - wake up and begin to scream at each other in a good way, but very loud.
And threatening to move the furniture.
In the kitchen, a crane flows - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as requested by the plumber, a new one.
Nothing is clear on the TV schedule, so I just kept control of the "Match", "First" and just in case "Russia" - although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the homeland of repetitions, the whole sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live there.
Hope, of course, at the "Match" - all night young man screamed in news releases first about the great semi-final of Deriglasov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on equal footing, winning the first half at all.
They put in the place of the officers of their own greatness, the Americans.
As a result, they lost, but, as they now express themselves, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but it's close to the fight with Di Francesco, and on the screen no change.
In a panic, I start to see the channels.
This feeling, the second time in a row, turns.
All right, let's go deep, cable.
There's no such thing as a thematic "Match" fencing.
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convoy surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the website of "First", it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this time.
I click on the fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglassov perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on the points - and quite obviously begins to pull time.
The Italian is playing almost the entire game.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca throws himself at Deriglazo, and retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman injects.
Victory!
A few seconds later, an Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
Fools, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Ministry of Muslims (SMU) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenum of the Duma obliged its imams to give Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force the young Tatars "to learn their native language".
The administration says this "in no way prejudices" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complains that up to 60% of the pilgrims do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants, and the Tatars themselves.
The Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the plenary of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in mosques of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
Tatarstan mufti Kamil Samigullin said this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language.”
"For those who say it's 'heavy,' in every big mosque, we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language absolutely free of charge," Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "must already be in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the Duma of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who does not speak well enough in Tatar, "may prepare for them thoroughly."
The Duma of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are held exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazan in a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian.
In particular, as pointed out by the mufti, it was practiced in the Burnay Mosque, Zakabanna and "Aniler".
However, Mr. Mukhametshyn stressed, the leadership sets the task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
“There can be no harm to the non-Muslims,” Mr. Muhammetshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself “is not a mandatory, essential part of prayer.”
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, there will be lectures and lessons in Russian in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin said that there was no serious threat of expulsion of the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of the executive committee of the VKT Rinat Zakirov said: "The mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language is “the desire of the imams themselves”, but in the executive committee of the VKT “they consider it correct”.
The “U” imams who gave sermons in Russian are ready to carry out the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with the understanding of the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be grieved.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere in the beginning".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show the way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we’ve been transitioning to Russian for four years,” the imam says.
He believes that the sermons in the Tatar language "will reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The results of the sermons will be different.
But time will show.
“It will only be easier for me, for example, because the Tatar language is my native language,” concluded Gabdulla Galliullin.
Former FSIN Director Sentenced to Trial
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow approved the indictment on the investigated GSU SCR criminal case on the theft of budget funds allocated to the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles to the FSIN, will appear before the court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court against the former FSIN Director of Russia Alexander Reymer, his former deputy Nikolai Kryvolapov, as well as the director of the Federal Criminal Investigation Service “The Center of Information and Technical Support and Communication of the Federal Service of Execution of Punishments” (FU).
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of GSU SCR in Moscow under Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which has had serious consequences), Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using its service).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury the budget funds allocated by the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the group developed a scheme according to which the company FGUP CITOS, controlled by it, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices that were exaggerated several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP CYTOS did not have the production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a completed cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found on the accounts of the FGUP branch in Samaria, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash was personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, a criminal case in respect of which is assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machinations, found an unknown origin of the cartridge to the award gun, which allowed him to present an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles to the accused.
Footballer Hakan Shukyur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the former footballer and then a member of parliament, Hakan Shukyur, and carried out searches in two of his family’s homes.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, attacker Hakan Shukur is being sought by the country's authorities in connection with an attempt at a coup d'état that took place last month.
Forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
It is about the movement "Hizmet" - a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan who considers the organizer of the attempted military coup, which happened on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media reports, an arrest warrant for Hakan Shukyur was issued today, and police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, the organization of Fethullah Gülen, in addition to Hakan Shukyur himself, included his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukyur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
He has not spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukyur remains Turkey’s most successful striker yet: he has 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukyur resigned from his post as a result of an ongoing corruption investigation into Erdogan’s party and its immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, on July 25, arrest warrants were issued in Turkey for at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media officials can expect long prison terms - from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the audience with large Hollywood films.
We make more than 100 paintings a year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reaches the screens.
“And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, which have huge budgets,” he said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miassa (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of the former deputy governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulich was detained.
According to the “South Ural” another lawyer of the accused – Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the investigative department of the SCR of Miassa today to file an indictment on the case of a year ago on the infliction of beatings.
Then Konstantin Akulic went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially it was excited with regard to unidentified persons. Now that he began to defend Nikolay Sandakova, it turned out that it was Akulich," - says Sergey Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulic became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "dirty" enterprises of the country - the Karabakh Copper Mill.
The Karabakh Honeycomb Plant was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the vital activity of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh Honeycomb Plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - the environment.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company came under the control of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize its production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The head of the South Urals called the grand changes that have occurred with the enterprise since the "Karabashmed" moved to the group RMK.
The main modernization event of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of JSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter conversion.
The replacement of three converters, sprayers, gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.

The pensioner turned the lantern into a "budget beach tower".
Users of the network laughed at the photos, in which an elderly man installed a sled on the beach and turned it into a springboard for jumping into water.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the group "My Taganrog" on the social network "VKontakte", which is why many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was called "budget tower" and "mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sniffle", and some drew attention to the fact that the man seriously risked getting hurt when jumping from his mast, as he installed it at an insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the portal Pikabu noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea by the photo.
"Firstly, we do not know what depth there is, the beach can be bulky with a steep descent per meter right behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters," - wrote the user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation for hacking the servers of the Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally blame the attack on the servers of Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain that Russia is involved in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures’ database in 2014, for which responsibility was officially assigned to the DPRK.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to aggravate the tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the market of mobile applications.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited pre-installing apps from other developers, in particular Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other apps along with the Google Play store.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, the head of the FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the solution and only then determine with further actions: to perform it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a breach of the competition law in September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a global agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat’s Anime Effect Criticizes as Asian Caricature
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially untouchable.
With the help of the “Linse” tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to create a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are crude, warping tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming known to the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of the app advertising dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that provided them with sloping eyes, curved teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist caricature of Asians — “yellow-faced.”
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions point to a more serious company problem related to diversity.
On Wednesday, reports spread and followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the next day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was intended as a tribute to the characters of the anime, and not as a cartoon about Asians.
But experts who know about racism are not unheard of, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least embarrassing.”
She added that "it's hard to argue with a side-by-side comparison of very rough Asian cartoons and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just a jaundice, but, to the highest degree, a derogatory jaundice.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview on Thursday, “such a course of events is much harder to go unnoticed as it was before.”
On Thursday, Ju, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity when recruiting staff in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white management of the company, consisting only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Zhou, who is herself an American of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they don’t have non-white people working, but they don’t hold positions where they can speak out safely and openly.”
Other reviewers share her viewpoint, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat has not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented sections of the population and active efforts to engage domestic resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that’s not going to work.”
Military leadership distorted intelligence on ISIS, reports congressional commission
Officials from the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the on-the-spot events provide, the congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican chairmen of the Committee of the House of Representatives for the Affairs of the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, found that their "widely perceived dissatisfaction" among analysts of the intelligence service of the Central Command
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the senior Centcom command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than is confirmed by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military is suffering," House Speaker Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, said in a statement.
Problems with leadership in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report elaborates on the flaws that have consistently emerged in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be falsified, it argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is known for sure," House of Representatives member Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence services of the U.S. Central Command forged command intelligence documents to mitigate the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up the task force when they learned that analysts expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, a report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, not yet completed investigation of the intelligence of the Centcom is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the House Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which agrees with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party’s chief representative on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, has “stopped the issuance of intelligence documents,” damaged the morale of analysts, and “insufficiently reflects divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to adapt their findings to a “deliberate or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector-general’s investigation continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing of Iraq and Syria (as more and more Defense Department officials are now claiming) is achieving its goal.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command providing true estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State repeats the disputes that took place more than a decade ago, when the intelligence analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper, which claimed that the administration of President George W. Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, did not speak out in support of the
Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State-intelligence protest.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team came to the conclusion that despite public statements of the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it built time.
But the discovery did not spread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate that many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins 4 consecutive times in women's grass hockey, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain
She once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bame opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's grass hockey team, when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games are set to be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she's not sure if she'd ever done something like this.
“I won’t use my mind,” she said.
I’m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here’s what she knows: the Americans’ 4-0 score in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan’s 2-0 loss on Thursday.
The teams of the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who will be second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a bit of weathering when the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a grass hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammates didn’t get along.
The following year, Coeg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity we have today.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game by throwing an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept a 1-0 score until the end of the third period when Bam took the lead.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball to the goal, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on strike.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the turmoil of the Olympic Games - "Zen" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have, it’s the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanging and unavoidable, it’s a crazy combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic fire itself, there is that burning torch that is passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in a café and not hear about Simone Bales, Kathy Ledeki, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Kloe.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first to participate in the Olympic Games, a handsome man with cheekbones, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing player.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in an Olympic trampoline jumping competition.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign for him.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal addiction, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years it has received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they belonged to Olympic sports at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not make it to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share men’s awards with each other, while Chinese and Canadians tend to share women’s.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have the charm of an outsider, in particular because for the uneducated ear, they are more associated with circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
They really have comical potential — it’s a caricature of endless jumping — but also the grace of gymnastics and water jumping, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", meaning "trampoline for jumping into the water".
The contenders jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and jump) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is forward.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth on the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in view of the cameras, to another annoying frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This persistent desire is noble, deserving of admiration, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the spectator crawl.
I think it’s a bit boring when you watch the games.
From him jumps on the trampoline give a breather.
The direction of the trampoline is upwards.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, as an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
And they, of course, do not do without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no insane eagerness to the finish, no jumps in length, only a strange, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest to Zen Olympic sport.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at the hour of the day in Eastern European time; men - on Saturday, also at the hour.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the day program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in the general dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to coveted gazes and objectification — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States — Dooli is only waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
“Generation protests” in Ethiopia, a long-standing US ally
Angry Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of a rift?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets, demanding radical political change.
Human rights defenders said the government’s response was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage of protests allegedly taken at the end of last year or earlier this year shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they put their hands to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions - the opposition in the territory of the state was stopped, due to the fact that the dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were expelled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other option but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seyum Teshomet, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely repressed the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are on the rise; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, are now flaring up.
The first one seems completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones became commonplace, and Internet service became better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian highland areas of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But it also changes.
"We will act together under one principle," said Mulatu Hemetchu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many in Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaoui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly skillfully recognized the first signals of discontent and used intelligence to obtain data and dispose of opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalien, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that as a result, it will lead to even more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such turmoil in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently an election that the government curtailed and then faked.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia’s leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amhar, attacked businesses owned by Tigers, and anti-Tiger hatred on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed that base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
“It will be hard to get through this stretched rope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quell the latest conflict that gripped his election headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he repeatedly claimed this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to wisely address the American people.
It also put his deputies, who were trying to protect him during the period of turmoil, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at the congress on Wednesday night, Trump firmly insisted on his claim Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just messing around.
This post was the direct opposite of an allegation made just a day earlier when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his indictment.
When radio-conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
Turning to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism of the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m kidding.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in a political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some of the messages that are getting a response from his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s cautious in his statements and knows they’re vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the utterances for the broader electorate, Trump has taken an even more offensive tone in recent days as his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking, published on Friday, showed that Trump is outpacing Clinton with a big lead in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and is on par with it in Florida.
Although Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the subject of heightened attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputy, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost an unknown small organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened because he brought troops out of Iraq.
The majority of average Republicans say the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the position of secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for disparaging his every word and bias toward him.
He teased the “poor unfortunate” television experts trying to figure it out and said, “They’re weak!”
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as further confirmation that he is not fit for president.
A once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a sleek, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took the place of Werb in the summer of 2014, is selling soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in the renovating city.
The artist Molly Krabbe wrote on Twitter: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But even though New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The reborn Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
And the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verb" is Sisko Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left much in the same form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of beagles and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verb".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings from capers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
They no longer serve beer in the coffee shop, but now they make freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he paid attention to the steady flow of old regular customers.
“Many ex-customers have also been priced out of Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of Rebecca’s recent resurrections, Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsberg and frequently visited the Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verba,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although on that day instead of the usual iced coffee she ordered a couple of cups of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a loyal visitor to Werb since 2003.
He went in before work and invariably ordered the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like clockwork, I came and my bagel was cooked for me with oil and all the stuffing,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he changes something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee from a coffee shop, cooked in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for selling juices plans to pour bottles and sell coffee cooked in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join a neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include in the menu their favorite dishes.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
“How long have I wanted to smell this,” he confessed.
Depressive food of depression in the "close table"
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as fua-gra and Maryland tortoise soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert pudding from blackcurrant.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
Cow’s latest book, “Ragu in Chinese,” was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a detached apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book “House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.”
Their new joint work, The Meal Table, which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
To some extent showing their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny small snack bar in the Flatiron Quarter, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Cow, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for a discussion of food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in high demand,” Siegelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe sneezed.
“He must have been lying on a rock in his stomach,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. The Thick Table describes how the country managed to suddenly cease to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and pastries, became the staples of food; the pastry is a "great way to dispose of meatballs," Siegelman noted, because chefs could hide the unsavoury ingredients in the dishes.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years has been the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not successful,” said Coe.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter is not suitable for baked onions.
This was typical for many homemade recipes.
As never before, and never since, householders—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Management from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” take on the challenge, and turn a burda like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
The “close table” is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government's reaction to starving citizens, for example, President Herbert Hoover's position in the spirit of "let the cakes eat".
Publicly bragging about the simple farm scapegoat of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
“He liked continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,” Cow said.
He almost ate in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to give an example on his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housewife who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most boring food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The spouses say that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of mother Siegelman — that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of a careless attitude to food,” Cow said.
Siegelman recalls: “She has seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unpleasant incident with the patrols.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were deserted, she and Coe got a dessert that they cooked at home: a blackcurrant dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called blackcurrant moss,” Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes spherical names.
There were no whipped creams, only black pepper, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Cow's asked for extras twice.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife: "Slightly rubled walnuts would not have stopped here."
The arrest of the defendants in the case of the mass fight at the Hovansk Cemetery is extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 the case of mass fighting at Hovansk Cemetery under arrest of the defendants, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
Fourteen persons were charged in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Hovan Cemetery there was a mass fight of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, as a result of which three people were killed.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexing of pensions for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodec during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters for how much we need to increase pensions in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks", - quotes Holodets "Interfax".
Commenting on the proposed scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudrin, to increase the retirement age by six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic is not considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen has called for an international investigation into Turkey’s coup attempt.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d’état,” Gulen told the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court has previously detained the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
The military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead Companies Will Reimburse Lawyers During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement for legal services it has incurred in connection with a patent dispute for a hepatitis C drug with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of paying $200 million in damages for the breach of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s medicines, the sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including an oath of allegation and other untruths.
In an appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. federal district court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for their rights to laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
The armed forces, created with the support of the United States, claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darvish of the Manbij military council’s SDF-allied agency told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton Earned $10.75 Million in 2015 and Paid 34.2 Percent Federal Tax Rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for speeches, and the former Secretary of State declared a $3 million income to Depart from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on food.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and breaks his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the State Tax Service’s audit as a reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton's campaign adviser, Jan Sams, tweeted, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's statement.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks were over.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of the issue and released an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who persuaded Trump to release a tax report.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every candidate for president has been doing for decades without exception: publicize his tax returns,” she told the gathering.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for the two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business reporter on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that it may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people who receive more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was “afraid” not of the tax-collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s election headquarters published tax returns up until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014, and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index equity fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into settlements — throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method proved to be effective, and the organization Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee for the Conservation of Nature took over its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use nonviolent, non-violent, four-step bedding to protect their homes and homes.
Many have used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit, we’ve seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, making them far more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Damian Bell, chief executive of Honeyguide.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of the elephant that broke the border and to deliver signals using a horn.
If it was not deterred, then the so-called "cloud of chili" is thrown.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the flap in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the filth remains on the outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a roar, spraying fine dust of chili powder into the air.
One sigh is usually enough to move the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after an attempted coup in July.
Such data was cited by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations,” the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, there was an attempt at a coup d'état in Turkey.
The authorities of the country have officially declared that the coup has failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of the upper and middle class.
As a result of the attempted coup, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people died.
Jewish director sharply criticized Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s phone code at the “request” of the Arabs — reported the channel RT News
A French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone code on the list, with employees citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary The Shaw, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the phone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Lanceman wrote.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration desk.
The response he received there, Lantzman said, “shocked him.”
The hotel's clerk said the move was "a thoughtful decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind this move caused the director to become even more angry.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed,” Lanzman, a hotel employee, said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a “terrible disgrace,” the Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is, in fact, a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this network of hotels is even more shameful.
There is no need for explanations here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “gets on” with the alleged claims of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hurried to dismiss any charges, calling the incident "uninspected" and "excusing" Lantzman, Der Spiegel newspaper reported.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of rapids,” a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel quoted the Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
It adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms of the state education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Geraldo Alckmin almost 100 state secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% — reports the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year’s record in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to screw nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the orders of the CEO of the Almaz-Antey concern, "dismissals in work" and "loss of confidence".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How can we explain such silence in the context of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defense-industrial complex (OPC) has a lot of problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
NGO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (ABMs) of sea and land-based.
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the interruption of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the commissioning was planned in 2013.
"Polyment-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been conducted in several years.
The truth is, as far as I can judge, there is no unequivocal fault of "Almaza", - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning may also occur with the S-500 air defense system.
The experimental and design work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Defense Ministry says that "work is being done on schedule and everything will be completed within the stipulated time frame", although in 2014 the ministry acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev noted that project deadlines could be both the reason and the reason for the dismissal.
In his opinion, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the CCP and management plans of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave positions at their own will, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of "Almaza" was perhaps a figure of sloppiness and resisted the "disarmament" coming down from above.
It seems that the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defence and do not perform the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the broken managers (machinations at the shipyard "Zvezda").
Increased attention to the problems of the sector is given personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings devoted to rearmament.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of OPC managers, seeking to have at hand a loyal cast of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is a far from ideal policy, but against the backdrop of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC, the state does not have other instruments.
The current situation in the defense, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the managers in the OPC, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The staff of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has taken up the famous saying “You want peace – prepare for war”.
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated spheres of influence on the continent behind Moscow.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there may not be a single quiet corner left.
Despite the general problem, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottish Callum Skinner races on the finish line, as a result of which the British capture bicycle gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men’s team sprint at a velodrome in Rio last night, as a result of which the UK team trio defended their title from London in 2012.
Glasgow's 23-year-old native was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youngster proudly entered history, sprinting down the finish line to wrest victory from the New Zealand favourite.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoi has since ended his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialist of the participant Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time that Hindes appeared.
The departure of Hoya also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman that was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoi four years ago - and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
Changing strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving on a larger gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his place as a guest BBC expert and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “That’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championships.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted deliberately falling off the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, “I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stands.”
We've all met as a team over the past three months.
We lost so many races with a world name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then another five successful days are waiting for the velodrome.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it’s not beyond the possibility of imagining how he repeats Hoy’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would show how Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — brings the same man to six gold medals.
It would be just like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which begins today and takes place over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoy it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knighthood.”
It was the only medal draw in the day, but there was subsequent good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dull qualify for the fastest four-kilometre team pursuit race.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying event, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngaw improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The British team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to own the average period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary now glory of the UK in reaching the peaks at the right time, perhaps just to repeat again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant’s owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s Portland metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called “hedged contracts” that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to deliver their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017,” the company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s earnings since fiscal 2018 is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in view of the “imminent termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate a metallurgical plant or ensure the supply of electricity to a metallurgical plant."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Thomas plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and has defiled at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the "Kardashian Family"), prepared reality-video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshers Rob and Caitlyn, also joined them is the most beloved uncle of the show "Kardashian"
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sikrest utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the show at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed the others to have this glory so far or so.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling Vogue release of the year.
With a thickness similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
The news of who the stars will hit on its cover is expected with such eagerness that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have merged before the official announcement.
The previous women on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more “celebrities who work as models” than “models who are celebrities.”
The Oscar winner and face of the Dior brand, Jennifer Lawrence, was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor came out to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine described as the “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she’s in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality stars or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Jenner’s position in the world of fashion, given her past star of the reality television show, should always have remained shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment".
This mood was once again upset after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to get caught up in dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's spoiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available through a paid subscription.
She sells self-made photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality show on television.
Public Law Centers Refuse to Service 160,000 People a Year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the least-protected population refuse to serve in public legal centers, as the sector prepares for the effect that will further cut funding for already existing activities at the edge of opportunity.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly the elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to deal with unjust deprivation of property, and so on—have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating outside the scope, are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the National Association of Public Law Centers’ latest census report, thousands of people are already being denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public law centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people are being denied vital services,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to settle complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the country’s average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public law centers and communities, their clients, and the Palashchuk government is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s election headquarters was sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s pre-election headquarters was sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after reports that his North Carolina operations director threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be solved internally, but realized that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillipe “pulled out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the duel at Vincent’s kneecap,” Bordini said in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional administration of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
“Guns don’t have to shoot to cause damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after a Republican presidential nominee made a furor, telling listeners in North Carolina that “Second Amendment people” — understood as gun owners and his enthusiasts — can take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected and able to stand.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insult by action, and moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Philip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Presidential candidate from the Republican Party Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County High Court Division (Charlotte).
Britain must put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general in London, but throughout the country.
In my opinion, this was exactly that huge benefit to Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we put all our efforts into making our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrou answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11bn infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from the T5 - chosen as the best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
They are now ready to provide the third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a huge success for the UK and I am sure the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-and-mouse" on the issue of ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking software are a game of cat-and-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the vertex around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims it was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source ad blocker community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe research; almost four times as many as those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is chasing ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in the mobile applications of Facebook for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a sufficiently lucrative article for Facebook to consider such a step as a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “ad preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted by ads.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are causing concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.
Advertising blockers are a crude tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to hand over control to people.
Woman relocated to a Swiss motorway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are urging witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morge in the canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a strike?
This is what the prosecutor should determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the darkness on the highway - a verdict was issued that motorists can not expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Paierne in the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman – who responded to an emergency call – was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions such as those on Earth could ever exist on Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously assumed that the slow rotation speed of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus may have had a thinner atmosphere similar to Earth's, and still spin slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than there were on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus shifts its daily side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio said in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella that protects the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly enough, are several degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by specialists in the study of the planets.
Despite the fact that Venus was once perhaps habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapour was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the position of Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/CEO of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have served as Colorado Avalanche’s head coach and vice president of hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must coincide perfectly with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 score in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind Wild in the fight for a second privileged trip to the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups – two each from the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Resume Negotiations and Suspend Strike
Working strikes on oil workers’ wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
The strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, which are under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the ongoing disputes," the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cut came after a 10-percent reduction in rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation correlate with the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Ribatelli, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Kahla.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these adult stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds exert a decelerating effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots — such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars are spinning more slowly than less massive stars.
Fishball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades ballet, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars,” said Riball.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars with their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Ryball said.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Fishball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
An investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, writes Kommersant.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, acknowledgment was given by the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for diversions he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armeniask, oil base in Feodosia, Kerch ferry crossing, gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that it was not possible to arrest all participants of the saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
The contract with him will be calculated for two years - until the end of the World Cup-2018.
On August 11, the Executive Board of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
This is a well-known footballer who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartak", "Zhemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynago" and "Warsaw.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is expected to last for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the duty to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority task he is considering creating a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall that previously the post of the head coach of the Russian football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team on himself.
Engaged between Angola and South Africa, Namibia has suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as a matter of course, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees for “cost reimbursement.”
In Namibia, however, primary schooling is free of charge.
Secondary education has also become free since 2015.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of malaria by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of growing inequality, it is shrinking in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also declined, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, as commodity prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the U.S. and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of estimation, remains quite high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the countries with above-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the territory of the country, isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers live in the deserts, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who a quarter of a century ago were on the periphery of the world economy is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country solves the problems before it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern parts of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia’s natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country’s resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of speech is so important.
According to the head of state Hage Gaingob, the media often say things that he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has received, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustive.
Some — such as fisheries — are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than one million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can stand on the path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one grave, known as "Grab No. 43", were extracted 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon pass to the opaque beads found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement, known as Tell Unacité.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Unacité is located far from the sea, near the village of Unacité of Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a gold stripe wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, the head of excavations at Tella Unacité, dated the find to 4,600 BC and said it was at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna, as we recall, date back to about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow metal to be dated with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the Unatsite gold is older than the Varna gold."
It’s an extremely important finding: it’s a tiny object in sight, but it’s big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more thoroughly the archaeological layer, where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the greatest possible accuracy.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell the Unacité is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Tell Unacité is now considered to be the oldest “city” in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metal processing in this region developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to emerge around the centers of metalworking.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunacite the prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is older than Schumer for a thousand years," says Boyadzhiev, referring to the common belief that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
It was there that the first cities arose in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tell Unacité have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
From the houses and workshops little has been preserved, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Unacit is often referred to as the "Bird City": dozens of clay figures of birds have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of local worship.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
Three-meter walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the usual notions of ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", which was found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the gold luxury of Varna had to be preceded by something - something like a tiny gold beads created in Tella Unacité.
Porsche artificially obsolete model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
"Retro bow" consists, for example, in a special body color Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - in this color is painted even the logo of the model.
In addition, the targa received a signature white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel wheels, as well as some details of the bodywork painted in "white-gold metallic".
In the interior, retro-characters are noticeably smaller: it differs, by and large, in the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed with black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a car cover and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists Porsche Exclusive did not touch: the retro-target in terms of characteristics is quite similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited edition, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleash “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the hiding of ads on social media pages, provoked developers of solutions to block advertising for retaliatory actions.
AdBlock Plus has released a “antidote,” but Facebook plans to make it useless as well.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus together with commercial ads also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook has expressed regret at this policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network TechCrunch edition, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race", trying to beat each other, the injured side became users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw an advertisement where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have recently been hotly debated.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear in court <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk region.
The indictment of the 54-year-old man was very serious: sexual violence.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia the Fengguang 370 crossway and the Rich New pickup - site Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the gaining popularity in China class of cars, combining the merits of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms at the Moscow International Motor Show this year have decided to ignore, so the void of exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends in the near future to offer our car lovers a number of interesting new products.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossween, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles at the current exchange rate).
For the Russians, such a price tag is unlikely to shine, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 by the results of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic lining on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to the cross-beam.
Crosswen is built on the front drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase at 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is solider, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla" on the center console was only on the early exhibition copies of Crossway, and the cars with "music" came on sale easier.
Five of the seven landing places are easily folded, forming a flat loading area of 1650 mm long, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission.
About the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer is modestly silent, but promises the owner's austere budget appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly enhanced Chinese stylist design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model is still in steady demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will surely be interested in the Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: gasoline 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox - only mechanics, the drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a tightly connected "front".
Will be on the stand Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere the representative office of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minvano-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on the transport tax will stop sending by mail - site Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to a scheme that has not changed over the years: in summer and autumn they receive receipts by mail for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many are not expecting them.
The fact is that the tax inspection without too much noise changed the procedure of notification of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal office of the taxpayer" on the official website of the nalog.ru department, notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically considered online users and deleted from the standard "paper" mailing.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme also has the owners of an account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" immediately after the drafting, while the letter will last a few days and may be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the online service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some may have registered in a “personal office” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Taxpayer's Office" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that in this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began to be sent in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which refinements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63-571-powered flying cockpit with tank aerodynamics and acceleration up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
By pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helical", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration up to a hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of swinging in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are certainly given to him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning all-terrain vehicle with deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze out 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced an impressive concept coupe 6 m long, which will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, at least four environmental novelties are expected to appear.
