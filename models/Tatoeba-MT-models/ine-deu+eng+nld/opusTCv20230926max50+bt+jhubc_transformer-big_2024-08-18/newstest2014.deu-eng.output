Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian lighthouse was put into operation at the village parking lot - in view of the older town hall light.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or a burglary?
The mayor of Gutach answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at the time, because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secured both cyclists and bus passengers as well as the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the crossroads Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security simply happens here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the junction area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the location selection of the traffic lights: "By means of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without bending the traffic lights".
The around 15,000 euros expensive lighting system itself is “the most modern one currently available on the market,” Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be clearly seen by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technique of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, green immediately comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or people with disabilities cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone is coming safely across the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think about this as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a top-class vehicle roared through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood – the languagelessness, the penchant for raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness – the Carinthia poet has often described.
The Buchner-Preisträger is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tongue tip", which can now be seen in the garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauenend" (2003).
On the largely emptied stage - an important prerequisite: a knotted sofa, on which it is supposedly copied and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
In this case, director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance imbues the presentation with a wealth of directorial insights, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their head submerged in water, with their evening dew on the wall.
Forced into cellophane or brooms, they stick on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely mute on the stage floor.
The text, however, hardly communicates in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and Winkler’s absurd humour flares up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system to fund U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly ignited an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while it is not possible to agree on a course of action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only likely to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record mileage for all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes paid by Americans at the gas pillar, is bankrupt.
But in America, there is not as much tanking as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent at high liquor prices.
“The gas tax is simply not future-proof,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most sensible long-term alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as mileage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance covered.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thus responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical of the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track mileage, but not exactly when and where.
This, according to Khan, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not join to help states in taxing motorists.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made big mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept to a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that also pays parking fees, only has to pay for mileage, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” the city’s planning document said.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile isn’t just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials stated that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off charge or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There’s no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Kingsfield: Small team is waking up
The Voluntary Fire Department successfully completed its autumn main rehearsal despite a lack of personnel.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice.
There should have been a short circuit during sawing.
Due to the resulting fire and the development of smoke, two people were injured, but one of them could still send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer’s first review of the situation, two Wehr’s respiratory protection personnel prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them out.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three detachment attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what needs to be done with little staff available.
In case of emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld day group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President of the Landtag, Guido Wolf, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he, together with the school managers of the vocational schools and the district high school, and the parents' counsellors, addressed this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thomas-Schule, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwarzwald.
In doing so, Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the Berufsschulzentrum in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness of the county.
“It’s important to not only keep an eye on the family phase, but also the caregiving phase due to demographic change,” Wolf said.
In addition, he said that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled labor, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills often remain preserved in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public transport.
“Stay persistent and make sure that public transport is getting better,” he told local politicians in attendance.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly were housed in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as a frontal demarcation of the old schoolyard facing the renovation to the church road is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Brünlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first renovation of the front schoolyard, to stabilize and statically relieve the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Stadtbauamt in Brünnling intends to include the National Monument Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table by the municipal council to decide and determine the next procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two lateral wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the church road, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow-forward inclination.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A sturdy wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the renovation of the schoolyard was planned as early as 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the National Monument Office.
In the event that the requirements come from this site, the city of Brünlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Grundschule, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new classroom, can soon use the old school yard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions about the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics are part of the Stuttgart jazz scene.
This contradicts <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on 22 September, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
U.S. border: 'super-tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
On the U.S.-Mexico border, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super-tunnel” for drug smuggling.
The more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system, US Customs said.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into service, according to the information.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy told a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Speaking to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. and Mexican security forces are in a constant battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the tunnel’s elaborate equipment, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seizure of marijuana.
All three are threatened with lifelong deprivation of liberty as a maximum penalty, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it said at a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA's San Diego drug search.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given about the detainees, at least one of whom was Mexican, it said.
You have to expect up to 10 years in prison.
2014 will be a festive year for Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be 1250 in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a party, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
This weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday evening celebration of the Black Forest Club, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geising city anniversary, a new chronicle is also released.
"It is to become a chronicle not only of Geising itself, but a printed work about the Geising of today, which consists precisely of Geising, church-houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geising of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 was completed today's spaceship with the communes.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunk Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has the festive banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which was the courthouse at the time.
Therefore, both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250th anniversary in 2014 is also 40 years back.
Council is targeting track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively converted to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the city councils have decided.
For this, Schiltach has to take in the hand 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings should be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles occur regularly throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must contribute one third to the costs, the rest are divided into railway and federal.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the "Am Hirschen" bay transition.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also stand on opposite traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greßhaber therefore proposed to construct a required retaining wall so that the city could widen the subsequent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road-spreading: Thomas Kipp brought the critics' mood to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas countered: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" could also be of important importance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the costs of the proposed widening of the road investigated.
In spite of this, the conversion of the railway crossing was approved by a majority on the condition that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 meters, if necessary, for meeting traffic.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could entail a completely different problem, which affects the access to the strongly increasing "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the train’s conversion plans investigated by the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit up.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction load carrier.
Accordingly, the conversion may result in liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the deflection worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the track transition, argued Haas.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other track crossings, because the stop is located directly next to the center, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision is imminent.
In the majority of cases, the consent to the conversion of this railway crossing was refused, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bath out" the problem of sitting vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
As unproblematic, the Board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years.
Thirty proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are you searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are currently being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that will drive research forward decisively.
The state for such "L-missions" is each about one billion euros.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now entered the narrower elections.
Numerous committees examined the proposals, followed by the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Program Committee.
In total, ESA has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus also the formation of planets circling these stars – are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To answer this question, the Cheops Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in 2017, which will take a closer look at 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for “biomarkers”: gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide insight into what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated by example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there is a budget of about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is expected to launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the Sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa envisages the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) spacecraft is expected to launch in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter common to us, from which stars, planets and living beings like us consist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose actions the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the explosion, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being granted an L-mission.
Among them, physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisions a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
It could also detect gravitational waves, unlike plants on Earth, that formed during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Find".
Proposals have already been made, among other things, for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and make statements before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of allegiance and tries to criminalize political opinion with a threat of punishment, in which there is no excuse.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Greens MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs assurance that he is “safe” there, according to the MP.
In his letter, Snowden said he was facing a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide response to “my act of political opinion.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities cooperation “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Frontier Airlines Charges for Hand Luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers are allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that they charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the flight deck.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second pieces of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore packed as much as possible in their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
These are Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have made it clear that it will be increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at Frontier’s flight deck, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrive at the flight deck.
Frontier’s new hand luggage charge only comes into effect in the summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave the finger of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first charged for hand luggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the flight deck if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual carry-on baggage charge.
“The boarding process was one of the most seamless I have experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions on the flight deck.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like butter.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly attempted to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but seven months later it reversed this after passengers had complained and no other major company had relocated.
Frontier’s move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz for $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight with Frontier over 1000 miles, booked with a third party provider, therefore only brings in 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier’s finances as part of the sale of the company.
Sayings come from the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast of the year in the Evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Prophets from the Bible" and "Talks from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, gave a lecture on the Bible’s proverbs after breakfast.
“Proverb words contain life wisdom, rules, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs to the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Wooden eyes be vigilant, like scales falling from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone, to whom the Lord gives in his sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also had her listeners guess what the saying was.
The expressions from the Middle Ages were adopted by the Church Councilwoman Christel Dehner: All good things are three things, blue do something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
At the end, a tombola was drawn.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously outlined before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: Pilot project for the under-apprentices in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as untrained workers in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA says ‘internal error’ and not hackers to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as online was claimed.
“NSA.gov was unreachable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to invade the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and sees itself after the revelations made public in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad have been exposed to harsh criticism by the National Security Agency (NSA).
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the office of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because so far, many companies have reacted to attitudes.
A reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, health care and elderly care".
Due to the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been running again since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit losses for Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three more takeoffs so far, making it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results lagged behind forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from outperform to sector perform in view of the limited exchange potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
“We were expecting weaker delivery rates for aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management assured analysts and the media that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been put in place during the aircraft's service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical that 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft into service.
Bombardier said it will review the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight tests – even though they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million and $172 million, respectively, and $9 cent per share, respectively, in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order volume in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30 and was thus unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within our expectations, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenue in this segment has risen by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order volume in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30 and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, Bombardier’s stock dropped 8.5 percent to $4.83, after it was also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette would move into the board of directors.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shootings at Los Angeles Airport
On Friday morning (local time) at LAX Airport, an unknown person fired shots.
While the airport management said via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported on several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being briefed on the situation on an ongoing basis, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident took place in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a gun in one of the departure halls, several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would scream and children would cry.
There was panic among the waiters, many hiding behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
Afterwards, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots were said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport Buildings Evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were rescued from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9:30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, resulting in long backstops, according to CNN.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it was said.
However, several planes were also spotted on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is served primarily by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, dubbed “Bash” by criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and colleagues were at a bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was abducted after police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet, and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but declined to take cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming her discussion was subject to the "lawyer's secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At the police interrogation, he stated that he operates both under his private address and at work, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called important actors of the drug trade, some of whom he had represented previously, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you’re not breaking the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, as he was the lawyer for these individuals.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He acted against the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his professional status into disrepute.
He stood too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any misconduct and claimed, “If I was a corrupt lawyer who I am not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job as a lawyer was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the song wreath Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 am at the service at St. John the Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair is presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamentals will change in the Haslach Soul Care Unit (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the fundamental decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new wavers hesitantly but with a glimpse of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officials of the team of pastoral care ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt gave a presentation explaining the new guidelines for spiritual care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body that enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a founding council, in which the pastor is represented by the power of office.
From each parish, at least two elected members shall be represented, in which six parishes are formed locally so-called community teams.
It will be your task in the future to promote ecclesial life in the place.
When asked about the finances of each parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes remain appropriately tied.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach said.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of “Becoming One, Staying Five” in 2006 and had to realize that it wasn’t that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafting will take place in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councilor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the spiritual care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed, compared to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorf family will be charged an additional 70 to 90 euros per year.
A major reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 cents per kilowatt hour to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
Each year in October, the four operators of the major power lines re-establish this fee.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can collect through a surcharge on the electricity price.
The city works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnover in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going to assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number being closer to 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do, drive in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue driving, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorbike".
However, the waiting time must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to linger for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic lights is to be expected.
However, those who continue the ride despite the red light, must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate themselves for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to be held responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The light was not defective, but changed to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
City Council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be seen as a full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the financial statements for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget fell by around 7.6 million euros over one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the approach with about 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The capital budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 million, it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the supply of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual report.
He and the city councils were obviously pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon become expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to dispense with high lifting rates.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have been reduced many times.
For these grants from various compensatory rods, there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must show certain lifting rates.
“We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as there will be investments in the coming years for which we would like to have subsidies,” Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir he has won.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and dedication: Jörg Kohr, pastoral lecturer on behalf of the Cäcilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in familiar ways: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers’ department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
In honor of their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries with the Neapolitan folklore, while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
With "Was ist die Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Beerlied" the singers' department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to their homelands, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer opened a casperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy at lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive postage these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Ambassador wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, kindergartens and nurseries from all over the Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment wish for your facility, you can apply with this at Schwarzwalder Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent construction workers.
What does it have to do with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Infuriated by Controversial Media Law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?”, read the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law effectively puts the media at risk, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras showing how the units dispatched to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate him, even though the invitation was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to a million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "already a single penalty can drive most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on those described by Kenya's "lively blogosphere".
If they silence the media, politicians could do with impunity whatever they want.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
Kenya’s legislators have been abusing public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reintroduced their decent salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports ground, despite the cold weather and the rain, did not impair the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wanted a more pleasant party last Saturday, but Peter didn’t want to play.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the festival, as did so many speakers.
Nass was therefore also the chairman of FC Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
Above all, he thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who participated.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The timid retirees laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations for solving the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas came up for the construction of an artificial turf sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the site and approved the country's funding of 104,000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summed up.
The construction of the 68- by 108-metre artificial turf site began on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its consultations.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be the subject of conflicting views on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for migrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD underpinned its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multi-tasking and thus ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasion on land roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
“There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not actually the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Drivers seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman from Musch was on her car on the Kempener Außenring towards Grefrath around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s car.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: Lockdown after accident at Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenau road on Thursday night, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout on the Schanzle he noticed that he was on the left turn towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
There was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constance.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damages were caused, the police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it was said.
Vienna International Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to gate 24.
There will be no more statements like this at Vienna Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker's statements are thus dropped - the noise level should be so significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of statements that affect individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already dispense with the noisy calls.
Due to the disappearance of these statements - on average about 200 personal calls made by the speakers in a day - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual statements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight paths or departure times is a bit lost here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to braking with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swanky on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horse iron throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It’s not about the width,” organizer Peter Saile explains.
The trunk must be thrown away perpendicularly, should overlap once and then just come to bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When it comes to horseshoe throwing, it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight meters, it is thrown on a pile.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can start at 10 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scots skirt.
Swabian costumes are also allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury will award a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been planned on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music friends come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabohic brass music from Schömberg will shape the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleets of polkas and marches.
But her repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be present from the hamlets under the rinds.
In Dornhan, he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Fool's Club.
On Sundays, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for an early start, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffeningen is a guest, and the "Oldies" will then finish the party.
The stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf has already begun on Friday.
Other programme points are on Saturdays and Sundays, among others, the Oldtimer- und Schleppertreffen, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman’s market and the sheep-shearing.
Specially for children there is a petting zoo, straw jumping castle, tractor ride (under instruction) and tractor-surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with vegetable cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The World Vegetarian Day is celebrated on November 1st.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yogurt be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Inflatable vegetable cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple cider vinegar or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
Loose doughs instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk yogurt can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest high school students got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here, a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of 9/11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373-metre high viewing platform of the Empire State Building while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, through the bustling New York streets of Rockefeller Center, we went to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was said to be a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge.
The hunting horn blower group of the Jagddreier Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The fans wear riding clothes, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on towing hunts musically.
The festive Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 am.
The redesigned addition shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the dictionary, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the counter in the district town of Kleve in view of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain with the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but always repetitive.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the interior at the 8th stop gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as gastronomists before the opening of the lovely café at the counter: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the surcharge, the sympathetic café-lovers hope for more audience.
Last but not least, the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same as seniors and all ages in between.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee delight.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright cafe.
Better say one.
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the night of the ring.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But it's not everyone's business.
Maybe that’s why Daniel Büttner isn’t a big fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it right for everyone.”
And with an event, I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
Let's say: Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the counter in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious interaction entirely in the name of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festival to hold honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special "Singer of the Year" award.
“Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also made so many rounds for us, our heartfelt thanks for that,” said the choir’s chairman Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for the participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choral director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was taken by Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed by the Board to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choral rehearsals always on Tuesdays at 7.45 pm in the club premises.
“New singing voices are welcome at all times,” Schlotmann said.
UN announces new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium Development Goals expiring in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening of the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
“I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball overfielder still has a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn down trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance warning.
I have trained many players in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is necessary to wait if there is further reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
First of all, in the cover work and in the switching game, it happened enormously lately.
Opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Independence Square of the capital.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in the next few years investments of over $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to alleviate concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who “wants to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can enforce his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide,” says Joseph Hanlon, an Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an offensive movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out unsettled attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has further increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, dragging progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in writers and teachers who are "excessively didactic", children would be "completely shut down", because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed "understood".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be understated, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years in the "Freihof" came to life.
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely tedious scene play.
From the time of his arrival, the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and bridged time jumps from youth to impending retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the city's great son.
Stilecht drove with the two-span and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippines also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimicry and gesture.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle appropriately played selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
Haslach’s mayor, Heinz Winkler, was honoured to be awarded the honour of honoring the citizens, who, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance on behalf of the then officeholder Hättich.
Their appearance was followed by the three-king singers who prompted Hansyakob to shout out: "Oh, how beautiful, youthful memories of my own time as a three-king will come to life again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the official church at the time was expressed by Hansjakob in the same way as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giant is growing
The chances of staying in the league of the sportingly downgraded Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible backstop.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg, however.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard process, as long as it's not established that Düsseldorf is not getting a license," Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
However, the Rhinelanders were denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church in focus
As the city’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office is devoting the last of its public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerloch is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There, the participants get the story of the construction of the church told and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a through and through Catholic area.
Last but not least, in the church there is a view of the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Basement Museum.
Cards are available at the cash desk of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. intelligence business in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified inter-stately, it was said.
A Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, she was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
Favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were at the same point as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to decide.
At the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand the Wanderpokal over to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach bei Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous participation events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether it’s making soap, turning candles, filting or making ropes, there’s something for every age.
The children are assisted by local craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop is also used.
When building cuckoo pipes, waterwheels or circles, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as push cart racing or stilt racing, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 14 o’clock each.
At a railing walk, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children on Sunday can look forward to the clown Otsch, who drives his shoelace with the museum guests from 11 a.m. onwards.
Hermann Büttner is cozy and fairytale in the meantime.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the Kinderträchtendanzgruppe from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both event days from 11am to 5pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders in their traditional work.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a loveable cauz because he set out to compete in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not to be deprived of his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue hoppers and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the envelope devices, a shrill warning sound sounds over the terrain.
“The signals serve security and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In case of unfavorable wind, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot ahead of him at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep berth in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be manufactured here.
“This year, we want to break the 3-million-ton mark in the envelope,” says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF Suez power plant is still connected to the grid, well over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning even against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at defending champions Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
The guests initially managed to turn a 15-point back 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made light-hearted mistakes," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of Munich, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title-holder Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has expanded, as has been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform in a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaunau Bell, focused on racial themes) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a reputable television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here."
Iran Satisfies Nuclear Negotiation Process
Iran is a week ahead of the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old man in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the youngster they had taken with her was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the crime in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a mental institution.
Puppies have to go to jail
The Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm.
The former German soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession during a trial agreement.
According to him, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women who partly procured for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he cut off women’s contacts to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly supervised to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed to have suffered a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations that were being listened to were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is a “completely broken personality” who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this regard.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has broken out of these circles and wants to lead a normal life after his arrest," he said.
Oil Price Continues to Up to $96 Per Barrel
The oil price also fell further on Friday after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late-morning European e-commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked a judge’s order demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program, removing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on an appeal from the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for stopping and interrogating people would be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training program.
The appeals court heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeals report stated that the judge must be relieved of the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released again after a police check.
An oral hearing on the city’s appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed a lawsuit that turned into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; neither would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implements controls.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous surgeries on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the deployments were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work at the club in advisory function.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn set up the hospital in Socogim, a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of almost a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, for example, slowing down against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling the story of Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to a mobile goat farm and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
Gran Canaria is not far from Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemails, and tracked them down, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the view of the prosecution, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not someone standing in front of people’s flats hoping to catch them in the fresh act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew of it."
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editor when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the detective's computer that had Pawlby and her sister stored as "projects."
At the time of the investigation, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as those of other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with a married woman because of an affair when he himself was tied up with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks disputed having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed dispute.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée-Palast in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was hard, too.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, announced the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 set between 29 November and 2 December are thus off.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flooding that hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a major event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“Protecting as many built-up areas as possible is the goal,” Häußler said.
Based on the planning of the protection against a statistically expected flood every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The floods that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year-old flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” Häußler said.
To achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to count on state subsidies in the amount of about 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the funding can only be provided if a comprehensive concept is implemented.
For this, the community depends on the participation of citizens.
A complex planning and approval process will have to be completed.
At best, 2016 could be started with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one is believed to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Anger prevailed among residents of the resort, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and first steps have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for canal systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be tolerated.
To dimension the sewage canals larger would swallow millions.
Seriously injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but were able to say little about the accident at first.
However, there are several testimonials that should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily clamped that it took the fire department almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
The two victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track was completely closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astonishingly the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, can be understood, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is certainly valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousandths.
Dick declares America – the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John’s revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is being developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, which resembles ours frighteningly, mutants are looking to the future – and the police are approaching.
“We arrest individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the agency said.
"We'll get them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, so we have a penal camp full of criminals." You read timelines.
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative acts as the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terror laws and the wiretapping noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a division of forces, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is monitored and a future crime committed.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only buys errors and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Speech about Merkel in Russia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations intensify corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Homeland Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word-change between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage capabilities to “steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his fill-horn on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and procuring data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have pushed the company’s paranoia to a new high due to state surveillance.
The overflowing barrel led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was mutilated, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it came to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence so far that the United States has disclosed the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scope and technical sophistication of the U.S. espionage authorities uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy managing director, said: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Management usually doesn’t brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that gives the attacker benefits.
In large companies, employees have been told for a long time that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or leaving a laptop in the hotel room unattended is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interception devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones were then thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, behind China, two of the countries that used to procure economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior ministry DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Exhibition gives answer to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to at least manage the wedding celebration, there was now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important vendors around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has taken hold again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses are often framed and equipped with embroidery, often with a veil, while at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch stresses from the fashion house Kleidermüller, the ghosts separate.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
It is important to choose the venue, it was explained.
Jewelleryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
“Cushions are also popular for girls’ farewells,” he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, floral arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - that is, shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.

Parents of Georgian teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in his high school gym, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat that stood behind the stands in the school gymnasium.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Investigative Officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted it.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he died the way the sheriff concluded.
“They are of the opinion that it deprives any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a “position-related choking.”
However, a second autopsy resulted in another cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the videotapes contained clues to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-bound children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand’s auto-injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently amended the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘gender indefinitely’
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-uniform genitalia.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “unspecified” or “unspecified” on the birth certificate.
The goal of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person told the BBC years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children each year is not born as a boy or a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well-developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise using the best available information for gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – on surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
One can perform a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender persons because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were manifested in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudicial crime.
Boys who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of an “unspecified” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she found it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But by now, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, now that it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he grows up with the sex assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with non-uniform genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who advocated the view that gender is formable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses—such as parenting a child—interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, characterizing whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a prickly circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations came to the public, who were “not happy with the result.”
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is worried that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign an ‘unspecified’ one to the child,” she said.
We fear that this will favour interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law “mandates” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an associate in pediatric psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space, so they don’t have to make decisions in a rush,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, thus giving them time before writing “male” or “female”.
This way everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown girl injured by gunshot from car
A 12-year-old man was injured in a car accident in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had allegedly fired on a group of children in Ghent on Thursday night with an air-pressure weapon.
This was reported to the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
Police are investigating, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in a timely manner and removed the egg residues immediately, no damage to property should have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvester bulls were also ignited in the city area, but there was no damage to the property.
A resident of Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in clo paper and his wheel arches were removed.
However, by the time the police arrived, the man had recovered all of his radar shutters in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to learn on her own, what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, a book by her has just been published on the topic 'Living happily in old age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what can't be done in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in the mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most people push it as long as they can.
“They’re always getting old,” she says grinning.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you worry.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
“Whatever form of housing you choose, it’s always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one also unites in Dolce Vita,' says the author of the specialist book willing to emigrate.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and ticks.
'For me, such a living room would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
‘In old age, you just need his retreat rooms,’ says Ries.
The author does not want to rule out that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this will have to be different than in the classic student WG.
“Sometimes you just want to rest,” she said.
With this opinion, at least, she is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the topic of 'getting older'.
That is why, especially older people would often also take inconveniences and restrictions in order to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all those who are engaged in the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment to first get thoroughly informed and not to hire the first best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it grieves her more than it grieves the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is accused of passing on illegally secret information.
That is why he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Previously, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence officer Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the attorney general.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be employed as a technical expert for the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which prompted me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even senior officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations about a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations entailed many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchasing have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political opinion.
Yet, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truthfulness and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden attested by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clock at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The President Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musical hurdle.
Report: Obama Campaign Considered Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s faltering hope for re-election looked better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, a Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the polling results that former Secretary of State Clinton has against the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were aware of the proposed change.
In "Double Down", it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally opting against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible polling results at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as “needed care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think about something seriously,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then-boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama’s political polls had reached the desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, similar to the traditional post?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been careful to create a stable foundation for a hearing-proof correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if it has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional emails being read along the way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam message, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unfamiliar people read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take note of emails.
This includes possible illegal espionage actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from co-reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes, according to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest clogged and pension cashed
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and maintenance money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg man has buried his dead mother in the woods after police investigations.
First, he concealed the death of the 89-year-old, then he confiscated the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be held accountable for fraud, a spokesman said Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it became apparent that the mother in need of care no longer needed medication.
The retired man told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had taken care of them most recently.
The 67-year-old finally admitted to his mother’s death.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital offence, according to the police.
Looking for ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice cream in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially make the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, thereby raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and of itself impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without every point in the Handball-Verbandsliga after six days of play.
For now, the team of Ingo Ehlers is coming to the derby against TSV Daverden, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehler said optimistically.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is also on pace.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase the coverage, which has lastly left everything but a safe impression.
Davenden’s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number.
But that’s why we’re not a favorite for a long time, because anything can happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to search in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga player HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I became more of a Halloween muffin.
In the last two years I have not declared myself ready to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I probably will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be exact — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, enticing inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will be making it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and rubber berries.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, 41 million people who are dragging through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spooks.
They have great names like “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spooky houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you just pee into your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you won’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you’re pressing on, like, a comment.
But let’s finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree—something we made from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which rots slowly in the foreground, is presumably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescuers find charred corpse
The fire brigade had to move to Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night to Friday.
Rescuers are carrying a charred corpse from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night, it was on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already coming out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was unclear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible lack of priests: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Hanover expects the number of pastors to halve by around 1,800 by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
Nowadays, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this to the process of de-ecclesiastification: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can focus on where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as caretakers.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well off it.
Certainly more would be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not only interested in careers, but also in meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated outlying areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien wants, among other things, to organize study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge wagon – it’s going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will have a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a puppy trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her unfortunate location
Firefighters sail off a rock wall and save the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to secure a dog that was trapped on a 15-metre-high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owned the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their missing bitch and posted help calls on social media when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the sanded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like a hard-frozen one.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist with the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge misfortune.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching the rescue was frightening.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to have her back in my arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed on top.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never played Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had collaborated as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that "he messed with me when I was 18".
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative for Jaggers, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made any attempt to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" immediately landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European decoupling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not – as expected – play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often flex their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-observance of Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what is really wanted from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so far that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why is the London yoke interchangeable with that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has fallen into disrepair.
With the Eurocrisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to garner almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September, effectively expelling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by the retention of the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – prompted by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives enacted by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage bills in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and lift Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which the French economy has to fight against.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a crucial by-election, thus putting the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide.
I suspect that Scotland could drive very well in a looser European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get an austerity policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is coming fast,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years until menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Frequently Occurring Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It’s controversial what actually represents the onset of puberty, but it’s “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endocronologist could be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant when it comes to medication, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” remembers a woman whose daughter had ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come into puberty like girls did before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a 2001 study of girls between the ages of six and nine, which establishes a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as it is for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than intended.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter clash at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are keen to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “Mini-Jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" accommodates 406 people seated in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft owners often distribute hooves about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people are getting thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
The average male American waist circumference in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival sticks to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly named “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus’s figures on seat sizes and says it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance flight tariffs with facilities.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing Cabin Expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat posed by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin equipment expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the facility with the competition.
Even if they value comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to plummet, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make the Pleasure of Smoking Go Out
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, further trials are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit trying all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "out of time", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is safe to give to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, could prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to quit.
“Then they know that when they start smoking again, they don’t enjoy it anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obedience
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state’s corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime leasing regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who possessed covert stakes in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where Obeid operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tenders after their expiration in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated on the charge that Tripodi knew of Obeid’s covert interest in the properties after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer runs.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought in $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tenders.
But he denies having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of expanded measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the arrival of family and friends to Australia.
A government proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Large statements like ‘foreigners should sit back’ and ‘Australians should sit first’ are a very unpleasant setback at a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in talks yesterday on human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if “the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking.”
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died presumably from a heart attack after arriving this week on a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England as early as the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring the UK closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip lasting three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unmistakably” advocate Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, Scotland’s economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail links throughout the UK.”
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the UK Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to have to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch, or play e-books on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in “flight mode”.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision that US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement, but do not pursue immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
“CASA does not currently have specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The subject is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said it was open to changes, but these would have to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it will remain with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may not be used on take-off and landing, and we have no plans to change that at this time,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision will have different impacts on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate wireless interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when taking off and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, traveling BVB trailers with light rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that offered itself to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The southern stands, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented themselves at first exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle cries.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint firing, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the podium, a large flag with the inscription "Stadion ban section" blew alone.
It was only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player, entered the pitch that short-lived cheers burst forth.
When his teammates followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves – but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing stirred.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a mood of celebration.
Only five minutes before the touchdown, the capo reached its podium - and the tension that had hitherto been felt by hands was released in a loud scream, as thick as usual questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
As always, the South Stand was the last one - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger steht auf" came up with a shout from the South Stand, everything was back to normal.
The previous silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectators' ranks and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top Dortmund Ultras in his office afterwards - and according to Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade that,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various options for punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
One must be curious as to how the reactions on the South Tribune will turn out.
Households are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a penthouse in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,730) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, this week became the third mortgage listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Loaning jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, mortgages offer the advantage that no credit check or proof of income is required, which is why loans are possible faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to mortgages after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as an increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in developed economies, lower- and middle-income families are looking for mortgages to make up for the difference in a stuttering economy.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's noted that growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, is a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency, have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“Ultimately, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further intensified the trend to pledge personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city’s 200 pennies are gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s get Grandma’s gold chain pledged and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai mortgage operator, EasyMoney, has seen 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the bond business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, said ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $66 million it took this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
“Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquidity of personal valuables does not increase budget evasion,” she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial trouble.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Secret Service whistleblower Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany investigate the NSA’s ever-increasing spying business.
After the presentation of the Green Parliamentarian Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine Panorama.
Rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put in place an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency support for electoral services.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for grey star, are expected to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinicians have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state would need to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that are taking the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his urgent request for help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election services will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “pattern solution”.
“We are in today’s situation because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and plugs the Commonwealth into 300 million and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the plot tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of one extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips away in lust or sensationalism – and that’s his problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tortured penance shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set up to destroy or “inoperate” all chemical weapons facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to start by destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility as well as warehouses, as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll via a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad’s army, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors as their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against time amidst a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “resigned ... and the chemical weapons program objects present there had been moved to other specified facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take my hat off to the bravery and courage that you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the monitoring organization, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, which are many members of the Alawites, a split from Shia Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted indignantly to the verdict for the last of the instigators, who were brought to justice as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot by standing law.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
A conviction was also found in a number of terrorism-related indictments, including a wave of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also called "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb builder.
The decision has stirred painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a bag filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of this year’s 10-year anniversary of the attack, which is being celebrated with memorials in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but not carry out cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not use their cell phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA staffer Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart it when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the captain a green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must turn it off again and are not allowed to start it again before the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are insured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even when taking off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft re-equipped to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Companion Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit,” Glading said.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like caretakers in this matter.
Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he publicly had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the landing.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handys are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitter masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966 after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communication devices by passenger-carrying FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don’t care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height has been reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is a proponent of loosening restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the malfunction was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only occasional reports of pilots talking about a malfunction of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for the disablement of the devices by the passengers in the event of instrument landing in poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who would today be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Air rescue service of North Sea drilling island rescued bird released again
A bird that was flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water raft was flown to Aberdeen last month by a helicopter, where it was pawned by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rallies was probably a wintering train bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He couldn't fly on any more, which is why we were contacted with the request for help."
Upon her release, the water rack was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who provide wealth and jobs in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than halting the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about their views on certain legal issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders are of the opinion that control over these key competencies should be regained after Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably what it says most, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for “meaningful change” that will bring the heap of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the UK’s terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s board of directors said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to provide more diversity in Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk on conventional routes, according to official reports.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” shut down.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work is expected to begin in other subordinate countries on the planned route towards the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no road leads past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the comparatively good economic conditions in the country.
This was highlighted by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, at the 9th Real Estate Day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The look at the transaction volume shows how sought after German commercial real estate is, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with child-related sexual offences before charges were brought against caring caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had “never been involved in an incident of sexual abuse of children within the organization”.
CEO Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as at the forefront of child safety”.
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest score of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at age 21, admitted that management had “failed from me down” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexual misconduct by twelve boys during his two-year tenure for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare denies that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superintendent was and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, stated that the child care manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superintendent of the Lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to return the report to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the YMCA NSW board of his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not about reporting” by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA Children’s Services Director Liam Whitley.
He said it should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was “overzealous” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse at the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, recruiting, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since resigning in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking out on British politics, and has mostly confined his comments to foreign policy and his role as an envoy of the Middle East Quartet of Peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister’s office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts gathered in crowds in Cardiff to pick the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and picked up the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his saucer cap at a crooked angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which lie well beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for his performance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then has been practicing every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field and left the pitch with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells recounted, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone lit it on fire and clattered it.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll cut well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the show ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes have contributed to making this a perfect fit for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be ‘reformed’ after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express had issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to falsify reports about a part-state company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The “rectification order” was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had released several inaccurate reports about the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disordered,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said they had decided to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter’s license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons in charge of the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public’s trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
It became clear to me that I had acted wrongly.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to properly review the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, authorities said.
Eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were recovered when the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between 10 years and life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing the drug cartels with the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are set to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday, Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the lexicon, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream pies, ice cream or a strong edamer, these badges are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to giving up meat and fish, the vegan abandons all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable amount of ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he has (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became vegan.
"The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First of all, veganism is an ethic.
“I don’t want animals to have to die for me,” says Proctor, the maxim of vegans that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirring eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, which increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that reducing the choice of food options with the diet change, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that caused some of the best-intentioned attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor compares.
And say, "Some tastes are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For a barbecue, Proctor brings, for example, eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly taste decent once.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but that’s not just about reducing it to animal food,” Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don’t take in extraneous cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
“My blood counts are good, I often get checked,” Proctor says.
In particular, many veganism critics warn against vitamin B12 deficiency.
"Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the cooler," says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need is available on site.
Every now and then I buy something special.
“Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but this is known to be the case with ‘ordinary’ finished products as well.”
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small cuts you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamism, when you cook together, it has a new meaning.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has also been expressed to him.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor said.
And more precisely, the everyday world then does not seem as vegan-foreign as supposed - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are potatoes everywhere!
“Many donation shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta cakes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly moving on.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there's enough demand, they might be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombuse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” says Proctor.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the biggest part of it impossible from the outset,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can be a coloring agent, one seems to quickly give up courage with respect to ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food, but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner look and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger-pointing that strikes at consciousness.
He may not quite manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers on their toes.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, Nasdaq’s indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transportation.
In August of this year, there had been two splits in a week alone.
At first, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
It took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading fell due to a computer failure on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
Facebook’s stock market crashed last year as well.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of buy and sell orders, later found the stock exchange supervisor SEC and fined the company a record $10 million.
Constance: Radler kills 63-year-old
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was riding a women's bicycle wrongly on the left sidewalk from the station to the market place on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the sidewalk from a local restaurant, the cyclist was no longer able to brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and drew a space wound about 15 centimeters long on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police have issued an extradition order to Assange.
British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old had been given a "call to face off" that called for him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to the extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has issued a request to a 40-year-old man to appear at a police station at a time chosen by us,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited by Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage allegations after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks’ revelation website.
Driver who hits 210 km/h with hot drinks between his legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped at Braintree on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking mug between his legs.
In Colchester, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 sacrificial surcharge.
Tax for Foreign Property Owners Against London's Speculation Bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp duty of 7% on apartments that cost over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Income from the stamp duty on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which stood at <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeds revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, the Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it is hard to argue that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained when it comes to buying real estate in London, or keep owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s wealthy South West Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tail nods with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail wedged more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right half of the brain respond differently to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail buds of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
We’ll probably soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilted mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that wedges), then their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience which movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedge with the tail is linked in one direction to friendly behavior, and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right dogs were important.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria, Canada, it was stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its ‘cock’ is swaying to the left and not to the right, rather than becoming restless – just the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined — and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won’t be long before we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer became ill with throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play in the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had already had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a throat infection, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur.”
The show will now take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
On 22 February, Pope Francis will be calling new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elective cardinals is again 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding opportunities for the reform of the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was “good possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been able to do this – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - we do not know who he appoints".
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backrest
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives for vehicle safety in head restraints.
“When driven from the rear onto the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” read the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperation of an Obama Voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would cheer me up during the bleak second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took one speech’s breath away.
The election became a landslide victory and news reporters stopped to bring to light the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is an evil awakening, as if one were torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced secrecy of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party’s blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be pushed forward with: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I came to the end with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads of state are allowed to be interrogated or innocent children killed by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose state misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was assassinated without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP’s office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and inexhaustible alternative that he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard so long ago.
But with Obama’s approval ratings dropping below 45% this week, returning to 2008 has become all the more difficult with this book.
It arouses in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to inflict a heavy loss on Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back on course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest over his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to erase questions from the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to abolish or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she’s getting vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax with 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, enter data into a computer, pick it up right away, and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, matching with pencils is unbelievable.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy was to have an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is a service to the public.
“We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, including two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly starting to take off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion a day changes hands.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that follows the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the situation reported that RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s instant messaging group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, people familiar with the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received inquiries from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks, “you can influence the market with very low ticket prices already.”
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
Painting the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and broadened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the property is in danger of slipping off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the BI’s action, a banner with the message “We are for it” had been attached.
However, this did little to disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against construction ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be much better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, according to BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also affect.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the exit for the thermal bath, should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be frightened, while others see them as a “lumpy extortion attempt” on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shelter for Schiris: Mane no Swan King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow Kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, when Senegalese became an alleged act of fate - which was certainly not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A sharp misjudgment," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, given the success of the race, Rangnick agreed to a Lobeshymne.
“There are only two words for that: really good,” he said.
There's not much to put off.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player steps in with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health bill
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which forces U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held that the Health Act’s requirement that states either extend Medicaid access requirements or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding would not be unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill was voted down by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place becomes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a small Norwegian town have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century-long dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" shouted Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley used sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
Previously, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally approved the 5 million kroner (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine resort of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
It's almost empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still empty on Sunday, will not be answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The FDP’s social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially in the case of appointment mail.
"This dilutes this undertaking radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and City Council, supports his fellow party members: "What annoys me is the fact that the vacancies are being changed or even deleted secretly here."
The post office is miles away from citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The same applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would also have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the Post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday vacancy in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatization.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt’s parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city magistrate is advising this morning on a presentation by Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50%.
For this purpose, however, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "adequate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast Actions Overwhelm Host
With a narrow frame, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen.
The Albers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that, even due to their age, they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placed bumps, the Gönninger made themselves extremely difficult.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not present at the block defense.
Two high first sentence wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all respects.
In the face of this repressive and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat lazy and lustless to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly prevail in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Raller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts especially in the ball acceptance; even in the passes the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical play scenes the over-zealous prevented the gaze for possible points gains.
The TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, always voted for the great physical effort and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Day of care at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley in the area of the hut should be cut off that day, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, referred to this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect can also find the ecological consideration.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the Weitblick covers itself with the aim of preserving the now strongly grown old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connection to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free compounds for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement of what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various presentations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been knocked down in advance, and the forest tow truck was ready to go if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet applied.
The 46-year-old banker and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate to succeed the mayor who no longer candidates for age reasons.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed an avalanche of lawsuits over patent infringement against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it oversaw in Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offering several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was oversold by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is demanding a high level of damages from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement is intentional, the indictment said.
Egypt to Swear First Freely Elected President
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, thus succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, whose seat is on the Nile and resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been largely banned by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after 11:00 local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer for the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential prank, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the 2011 insurrection against the authoritarian Mubarak to the finish line.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel, which played the national anthem, which he listened to in the habitation.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest auditorium with speech choirs of "The Army and the People Are One Hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the outgoing head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not as usual before parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers toppled by leader: seriously injured
When replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured himself on Thursday.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a guest house.
As he climbed onto the ladder, which leaned against the gutters, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christopher 6".
Rapist in South Africa: twice life in prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator has been sentenced to twice life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The incident had sparked horror across the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the youths was so horrifying that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen during the trial.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64,000 advertisements for sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pork beaks, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham, which you get in any supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair-protection and coat he enters the factory.
Jumbo also has to first disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo for strengthening at a quick bite in Waldshut seen
"I'm working here in huge quantities," the TV makers say, astonishingly, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 Colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
TV with a level?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m looking forward to when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens,” Jumbo said.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But the watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the Cologne remains manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke ignition visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Pine branches here in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test power supply.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concluded.
This will enable all those involved to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual earnings before taxes to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, then this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made an 8 percent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way to record year-on-year earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK was doing well, while business customers were spending less here too.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so for the third consecutive year, a profit for the full year is expected.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “unseen texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
As of 2015, students are required to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Examination Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “challenging, ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum will focus more on “problems from the real life”, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color shots will present the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The assessments were made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 is organizing this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations existing in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., which is followed by the Victory Ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola with great prices and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
Had people in the past centuries known too much about this, and at the same time relied on those images of heaven and hell, "which characterize our ideas to this day", then the contemporary prophetic teaching is characterized by the hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by religious criticism of Christians," says the spokeswoman.
She “provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.”
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is connected with the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Klein Heuberg reaffirm their faith at the ceremony
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament of Confirmation, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the Firmlings had prepared themselves for the great festival, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects, they learned about different tasks of the Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race delights participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hillsides around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the sporting association Illmensee announces this.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, there were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both of them were able to settle off the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the Albtraum team who managed to climb the winning ladder.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topathletes at the start.
Four riders were able to depart from the regional top riders.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already twice world champion in the twelve-hour drive.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
This includes Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championships in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a lashing final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Just a second later, the routine player Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Area Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Tune in here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 “CNN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him as “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States, the ratio for a doctor is 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Bwelle made the decision to do something about it ripe.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He became a physician himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves in minibuses and drive with the corded medical equipment on the roof over unfortunate terrain to the villages in need of help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the surgery, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s an exhausting schedule, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’ve been drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free surgeries over the past year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a leprosy he received now allows him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” he said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers with Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgeries where we help drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the acting.
The old man Santiago can't be bothered with fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, about which the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately through his knowledge and also his willpower wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is on stage as a solo performer on a wide range of tracks.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is made up of only blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the respective active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her wonderful voice the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play the Cuban rhythm and at the same time are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descending to the Romans
At a length of about 120 meters, a Roman-era sewage canal is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers protrude into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers suspect that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city walls.
Therefore, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and stop only their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods in the park deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins of handteller-sized stones.
“These are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take another look into a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend back into the depths.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of the Roman Right and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former Governor's Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hallway, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests on.
There's a surprise for Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-meter deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, it will be a few more years before it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rock environment is re-recorded after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in the Frankfurt (Oder) Regional Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the opening.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about district fighting and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice upheld the judgment after reviewing the prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the district court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
At the outset, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the act night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was summoned.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the accused and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
It’s difficult for rockers to almost always stick to a law of iron for them in court – and not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Prosecutor’s Office said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The disposable company does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but someday it's going home.
Only: In the stomachs of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other may be responsible for the cocktail or cult!
What’s closer than being chilled to the next drive-in to indulge in a treat?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to fast food shopping late at night or early in the morning.
A few potatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs become noticeable.
What does it mean to throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Especially on the weekends, discarded paper bags are lying on the edges of the road and on parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just the paperwork that spoils the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up transport facilities such as guide boards and thus triggered accidents.
But she doesn’t think about this, probably she doesn’t even know what this word actually means.
If you are traveling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a backseat can look after busy nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are turbulent there.
There, a few bags would be more or less nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food remains of other people.
I already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities are getting too stupid to clear - and the fast food chains have to ask for money for their bags.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retraction yesterday at his often-repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relatived his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance policy can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the resignations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to search the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to revisit a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserved better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an aggrieved Sebelius to a counsellor sitting behind her in the House of Representatives hearing yesterday was recorded after a dispute with Republican lawmaker Billy Long from Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot in the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis blamed it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base, on which Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack, but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” followed by a military response.
John Kerry said in an unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage had “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a shift in the U.S.’s defensive stance with respect to its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had “inappropriately gone too far” in certain cases.
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities were made public.
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the president and I and others in the government have learned some things that have happened by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so still goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course to 9/11.”
He then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to make it clear, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that insists on killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been informed of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. on anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs has stated.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the National Security Agency’s frustration with monitoring.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week said the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and outsourced to the United States.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing for the Congressional trip to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MEPs are expected to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the type of espionage programs they have been using for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is planning a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the turmoil over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is bragging about a deployment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six hits.
The Mainzers already have to relinquish the injured contractors Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having made up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who has approached the Foreign Office in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are obviously very worried, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is on bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she was taking vacations in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel buyer Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may have been trying to improve his hit tourist image, and so it comes to an acquittal.
