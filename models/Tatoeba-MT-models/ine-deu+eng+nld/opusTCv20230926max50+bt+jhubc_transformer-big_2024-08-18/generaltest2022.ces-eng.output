The great return of the Czech smolter is approaching.
Pavel Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 31-year-old Pilsen native will be on an alternator and soon he could get to the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvinov, Pilsen or Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He alternated with Vegas in the middle of the game, and has not represented himself in the NHL since.
The incident occurred at the moment when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
“Pavel Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois will be out for about three to four weeks with an injury to his lower body,” the Denver-based group said in early October.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time he was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
At the AHL, he accounted for 94.5% of the interventions.
The hockey player from Pilsen finally wants to prove that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his last year, he had hip problems, and in the shortened pandemic, he didn't catch a single match.
In the NHL "Fran<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xAD>k" caught 36 games, his success of the procedures is at the number 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's robe at Christmas, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year’s Christmas wish.
His wish was also announced by Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which his daughter Camille helps to put on a dress in the races.
This was reported on the BBC's website by the British news station.
They send wishes to friends, collaborators and foundations with which they cooperate.
The photo was taken somewhere in a desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a collar shirt, just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not mention, it is not even clear exactly when it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photo intended as a Christmas wish on a bundle of straws in front of a pile of wood in their rural mansion in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at a race in Ascot.
Charles, with a cylinder on his head and a robe on his face, helps Camille to put on her robe in a color matched with a light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have a million crowns promised from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the server efotbal.cz that he had access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the club Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said that the red-and-whites did not allow any corruption.
The server has published a transcript of police interrogations, in which Slavia's former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer, is featured.
According to the file, a former influential official of the red-and-whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then-second-league Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
Forensic experts have reportedly been working with information that Slavia Berbro has promised a financial reward for getting the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to have a million-dollar bribe promised by SK Slavia Praha officials to win the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
He refuted any bribery allegations.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, sought to influence arbitrators in violation of the rules of fair play, and have not provided anyone with any financial fulfillment in this regard,” Tvr<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia players with dark skin and also insults his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The case of alleged influencing of matches through referees started in mid-October last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest-ranking in the affair is the Berbr, which is no longer featured in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artists must take out of the armored cabin and carry the cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it has already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even for specialized units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I have a honitba right next to the city.
They climbed nutrient from the river and did damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to mess around, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox left in a moment.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, waved his brows all over the place, so I called him and said it was a fox.
He was gone before I got off the seat.
I mean, the meadow can be Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a combination of lots of coincidences to make something happen, you would probably have been seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive stuff, you put your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be okay.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch versus Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
Respirators are cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The state, which is responsible for buying and distributing diapers, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which of the following agencies acted economically?
And why did others buy a funnel?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> is speaking with the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tova.
I respect soldiers and armies (I’m probably not affected by the memories of the <0xC4><0x8C>SLA that older generations have lost), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don’t even have large warehouses of technology that training can grab, we don’t actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, and modern technology is increasingly complex, so the skills of bookkeepers will quickly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to retrain someone.
And finally, invaders/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are being led, and this is also a pronounced need to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only be fought in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will already be irrelevant, and we do not have an appropriate geography.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there is a situation where you look at a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, walks into the attack himself between two or even three Swiss and you say, "Tv and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Of course, he is considered to be the average tax payer.
The situation with this skill of "leading a defender" is so terrible that I was caught being honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect a major turnaround for the coming weeks.
The attack on hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown is known to have been added to the pandemic equation: a variant of the omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to the extent that vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous transmission of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the Covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe illness and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from the company Pfizer, which from the results so far reports success even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients is molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to end up in the band because the drug was developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
However, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak has grown".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist asshole.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
He's afraid to cancel the culture, saying this in public means losing his job and lynching the media.
Then the surveys look nice, the west good, the east bad.
But he'll find out what people really think.
Only in France Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical for rotating units so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Hills and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either for safety reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads due to its western location.
In those underground casings (in each maple there are two) only the heads were kept, not the whole rocket as they are called.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted it on some carrying device.
In addition to the museum maple, those remaining are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a fellow student of the gypsy, 4 years we were with him.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he was often showing up too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone was having fun with him, he often went out and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he was going out regularly, he was doing sports with us, he didn’t steal snacks or phones, he was walking cleanly.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkey farms, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same class, another class.
In short, they beat the teacher, often solved something there by the police, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I have already sold often to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like that, the guy called a month ago that he had already rewritten it on himself.
I tell myself that I’m not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue, or other, as long as they behave as they belong in a decent society (works, works, women don’t beat up, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, he stretches out his hand, he vacates apartments and houses, he just has a mess around him, he's making trouble... so it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'm gonna mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, they start doing business, they start working, they learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticka
"The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," said Zuzana Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health rescuers.
The accident was probably the fault of the driver who drove the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle probably drove in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC4><0x8D>ovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet identified, went in a turn in the opposite direction.
After a collision with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, a Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Schwarz described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was left in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with emergency pre-hospital care and, in a stable condition, he was transported by air to the Czechoslovak hospital, rescue worker Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collector's cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, let’s say from ten dollars higher, where it still pays to import, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small parcels has been slightly overpriced, he has to add VAT and the post office to transfer data to the customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail with the message that the customs officers are waiting for the arrival of the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if VAT is not already included by the trader at the time of sale, it will be measured by the customs office from the total amount per consignment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two slash boxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs regulations, the number of international mail received from abroad has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000 per day.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the requests to provide data that are necessary to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments in international mail that we need to process.
If people were to fill in all the necessary data and fill it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Resolving Inflation
See the title, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the government should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's headed?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run while working.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for only six months?
I just don't care how the court can send such an animal behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention that the victim of rape may never recover from it again.
Doesn't this also address potential future reports of rape victims?
The man from the tomb “burned” his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationwide sought-after girlfriend from Kostomlat, to whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He summoned them to himself.
He went for it a little bit.
He first addressed the passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
The guards arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged "robber" told them that he had invented everything so that the guards could come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to make a notification to the Czech Police.
After verifying the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and was given an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore being handled by the PRC.
An honest question to the people here, do you consider our country to be a slave?
I am personally of the opinion that we have not been married ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague from the United States :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe in something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, of about ten thousand different religions.
Which God or Gods should you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the Tenth it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
Wouldn’t it be more rational in such a case to abstain from faith in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one out of the thousands of gods, and the one real god I just didn’t meet would send me to hell or some other place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files would be good for something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: the cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly blurring, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of interconnection, when the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interconnection should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or a Mongolian invader.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved into stone, we have allies and they will defend us if trouble arises.
Well, congratulations to the gentleman.
One election in the U.S. is enough to curtail their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown that they just have to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that functions as a guarantor of independence for a long time is the armed army and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled means, whatever it is they can't do.
We don't need border fortifications, that's bullshit today, but get a teen behind a pinch of remote-controlled device to deal with it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack presents under a Christmas tree and suddenly you are stuffed at home with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulations.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring to the involved store (the project map KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging cardboard for the last period has increased by 50%.
In the eyes of environmentally-conscious customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, the manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are taken to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vek near Brno by individuals who gather at home, but we also hear about companies with whom we have agreed regular bundles of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopushn<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the household, where to deliver past medicines, tires, serviced electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, plus reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such places.
“There are gradually increasing collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become useless applications,” adds Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>eb<0xC3><0xA1>sek, one of the authors.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and it all pops up on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique since childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU – starting in January – before the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the presidency’s logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the streets – and mentioned so many events that they cannot be achieved in six months.
The French people love it, and so do the voters.
Macron’s supporters of the right-left divide agree on a few things, but in Europe they do.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar also had an impact on the priorities.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready for such work by historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators immediately hurried with criticism that Macron was pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is rather trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour is now circling France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are eagerly learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who he defeated in which battle.
But if they don’t have an enlightened cantor, they won’t know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, has also won an award for directing and for best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ova.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the first steps of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being stuffed" for a couple of days I had diarrhea and didn't have a lot of desire to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I don't claim that everyone has it)

In his second prose, photographer <0xC5><0xA0>est<0xC3><0xA1>k tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a long-awaited illusion.
The bohemian and comparator conveys the tale of the red dwarf to the backdrop of the present village.
Her presentation of brutality surpasses popular versions and ranks in horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
The author in his penultimate novel tells a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we are used to listening to.
Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about themselves to spend their lives together.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, where RegioJet starts operating instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or their route, if necessary, slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets in the autumn.
In the new timetable, the Czech railways plan to operate an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be operated daily.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Tracks alongside national routes under the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be dispatched by the carrier to North Moravia or western Bohemia.
From next year onwards, the carrier will traditionally increase its fare prices by an average of 3.2 per cent.
Routes take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry on the R23 line <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
After success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace the Czech Railways.
RegioJet will operate a total of 16 flights per day, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>r nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the carrier tried, despite the planned exclusivity work, to keep as similar the travel times of its long-distance trains as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers in Czechoslovakia, for example, where on the route from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav via <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Rumburk, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the single rail fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflation rate of 3.2 per cent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to die.
In my life, I have not heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends it, only condemns it.
No one will tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they'll just tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I didn’t see anyone deliberately silence the facts, but I’ve heard before that this is happening and in my opinion it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (like in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about one’s feelings, it’s just what it is and I think it’s a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we are already with those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave workers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they had some of their good achievements and it seemed absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it today.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave and a lot of things were against them too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our view does not exist in them (on YT there was also a video from the television, where they took out someone who began to talk about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found that in some universities it was appalling, that the students were quite radicalized, and that the schools supported them so many times.
And if I imagine these people will one day be much older, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer the same thing, it has radicalized itself.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even with quite reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't even come across anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I've had a bad geography, but it's two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because it's completely irrelevant to me.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality in general to be superfluous in terms of some personal identity.
If there's anything that connects me with people, interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice man, he preaches about theology rather than politics, but then he always screws up some cocoon about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they are born from Catholic modernity and are actually Catholic without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanick<0xC3><0xA1> street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – A flame ignited in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him over from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing.
It was taken over at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the department every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, Am<0xC3><0xA1>lie Bud<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a scout, told reporters.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing in the parking lot.
But for him, scouts usually take a train to Vienna.
The distribution of flames in the Czech Republic does not change anything.
With the Bethlehem light, the scouts traditionally took a train to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrlem.
Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent light distribution on Saturday, December 18th, who will travel with selected fast trains and personal trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread flames throughout the Czech Republic even where the railways do not lead.
Also this year, the scouts must comply with the existing measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear clothes, try to respect the distances, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, just to behave in such a way that it was as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem Lighting event Zuzana Hrbov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light that travels through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread, at the same time, the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event stands for hundreds of volunteers, so flames are also a symbol of indifference and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have an economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don’t think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will use the money properly, but I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million hangers "xy funded / co-financed by project xy" in the hallways and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the slowing down of development when this company is both holding and taking jobs/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I find that they have influenced me too - it's just so blurred that people don't always prevent it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to ban programmatic (<0x3D> targeted) advertisements completely...
It's all bullshit, in the words of a classic - I'd ban those internets.
I feel like this virus is rooted in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion, which I’m going to say is critical thinking.”
“I won’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
TV has fallen the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of which is two hundred this year
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Movie theaters, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen short of the Christmas movie trend and this year will premiere more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring points and significantly increasing the audience’s attention, which is why these images are being created more and more.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be a lot more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, especially fairy tales are associated with this period, pictures such as S<0xC3><0xA1>m doma, L<0xC3><0xA1>ska celessk<0xC3><0xA1> or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom in Christmas photography only started in 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC said.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its viewers for Christmas on October 22nd and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competitive station Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
"In this magical period, the story doesn't matter much, it's important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it's snowing," said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last couple of years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, TV Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end there will be some misunderstandings, which, of course, will be solved successfully and the two kiss.
It’s like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other.

Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19 and won’t make it to the final race of the season.
Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack for a better position from the 20th division, which he went in the qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas barn will not enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher will start from the last division, and Max Verstappen will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct title fight.
According to the Haas stable, Mazepin is quite fine and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be guided by the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas won't or can't send a replacement rider to the race.
A possible substitute would have to complete a qualifying or driving course in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not affect the first racer.
Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19 at the start of the final season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze you!
It’s a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator has put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, at home, sweaters were never worn very much,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in six months.
Silk bought in Italy, 24k gold threads in France and 2000 ornamental crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And it has one more hook.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” CZK 720,000.

Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
“Currently, we have further suspicions of this variant in the next child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov High School is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the region in a week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague," the director said.
She added that it was two nurses from one workplace of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old students of Adamov High School.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four with no symptoms.

California is restricting arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous U.S. state by a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial abortion law following the detection of the heartbeat of the embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the lawsuit of anyone who makes or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday that Texas’ abortion ban remained in effect, despite a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion across the U.S. by approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue that arises from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack it by ordinary judicial means.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” he said.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” Newsom continued.
He said his subordinates had been instructed to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the justice minister on measures that would empower public representatives to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
Domestically produced weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are thus designated.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, “ghost weapons” components or sets for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of a liberal member of the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict, would be confirmed.
The Supreme Court, however, did not recognize Texas’s ban on abortions as being fully immune to a judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against selected agents in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like, and there is also an improvement in the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, a large number of studies on the effects of 4 doses are already being carried out.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination will have its own vaccination schedule over time, it's just too early for that yet.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which promises up to 10 times more efficacy according to the manufacturer's specifications, should soon be available on the market.

Poland threatens to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it exercised its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of Poland's plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU's fund to rebuild the economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail veto on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully depriving us of funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone during Ziobr's actions threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, “Brussels is setting impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw faces “a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not a government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracies that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which the sovereignty of Poland would be curtailed.
“We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony,” he said.
But to confess... we at Lidl have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I will not go to any market anymore, no action, gold store on the square, there may not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some order, so I have in ten minutes finished.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching how data is treated here like fertilizer, and most vaccine opponents are just a little bit more out of the box than most vaccine advocates.

I was punished with a boiler when I was a child.
It was never because of the signs, most of the time it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hurt (sometimes even after another "drip" she just brought the kettle and laid it down so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a few butt wounds (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (to a reasonable extent) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice in its own way whether he will not obey and get, or improve and there will be no punishment.
At the end of the day, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl, in 1999, answered a journalist’s question about what the Czech Constitution means to him – whether a sacred charter, which he is sworn in and about which he has been studying at school for a while, or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely bowed to the first.
Once in the constitution, we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and better to save them with changes.
And imagine: some people even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voted at the time.
In recent times, however, there has been an increasing number of lawyers who believe that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended.
Years are being tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to dealing with most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that determine the politicians mantinela of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians to prohibitions.
But at the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid is not a choice, at FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder in children, there are also serious cases that hospitals have been dealing with mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, we talk about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," said Petr Dominik, primary of the Clinic of Paediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at the Children's Infectious Disease Clinic.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-olds.
In hospitals, children are also in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
“Currently, we have a child of several months and adolescence,” said the primary.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital for coronavirus so far.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominic, the children’s hospital – not just the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the collaboration between psychologists.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, as in adults, so in children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend administering a vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but do not climb over the fence into the branch).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the marked path is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does the conductor train?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfi<0xC5><0x99>t laughs.
He is decoyed by the Liberec opera and originally played on the forest corner.
As a singer he can sing almost all the repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberec F. <0xC5><0xA0>alda Theatre, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the castle philharmonic, with the film philharmonic or with the Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of the disease being managed and that the authoritarian regime is better faced with the crisis
Sinologist Jirou<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression that the disease is being managed and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop an epidemic that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in infections.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective aids, and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, in the worst-affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, “Don’t you want an elephant?”
I have it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car, the children play with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
So let's get it together, it'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one he bought complains: you dude, what did you sell it for an elephant???
The lawn is sloppy, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's all set, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says, "You don't talk about an elephant like that, you don't sell an elephant like that."
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works on its integration.
It operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a vocabulary expert.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spanish oranges and mandarins" when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruits and mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and there is no need to further specify it in the US forces.
But then again, I just need to say something :D
Either way, it's an unreasonable request.
In Tokyo, an earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and surrounding areas was hit by a 5.0-magnitude earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage has been reported so far.
No tsunami warnings were issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from the UK tortured the monkey of the cosmos Milly
The frightening footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crawled into a toilet bowl before her ruthless owner washed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
A magistrate’s court in Gwent has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts, who care about Milly after her abuse, said they had never seen such a frightened cosmonaut before.
Milly has spent nearly two years in rehabilitation at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison by a magistrate's court in Gwent, with a suspended sentence of one year.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life ban on animal husbandry, and must pay a total of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader Steph Sawyer, who rehabilitated the animal, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the sight of new people in her can still cause panic.
Psychic scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage of her wife's phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly groaning vulgarly.
The next video shows a Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for 1,600 pounds (less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric period three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in the first year as you did in the sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of bifling, where no one, with exceptions, cares if you know or understand it.
First, write a test on 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
They've all gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even take it and tell you they're totally in the shit.
So what the fuck are they learning?
I’m a big fan of general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need it.
And in that moment, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly learned for the many people who will need the thing.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this at the machine, I was really serious... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which is probably also the case with our communist past and the anger against the educators and the elites.) But the price of being barbarians in these machines is simply high.
If journalists were able to count, Covid probably never reached these dimensions here.
Wedding at First Sight: The War of Kadri and Andrey Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, which she was so disappointed in Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Kadrim and Andrea had been chattering since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move after her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he was annoyed by Kadri's reversal in response to Andreina's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri’s alleged honesty was no longer liked by his ex-wife, nor by his younger sister Linda.
My brother decided to go public.
I don't normally comment on things like that at all, and we've never really said those things to each other in our family.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and taint the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn’t give me that!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I’m even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri the way I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrey.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added uncertainly.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao began his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
A video from a security camera shows him walking down the street away from the scene of the crime and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then stopped Chaa.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed the money, in drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
The drunk climbed up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is time-limited and is effectively tied to pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business.
Isn't that good enough for you?
The right to collect will be limited, but not revoked.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all the things people write about you here.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to fight with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal of making them look good).
I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the Thirty Years' War.
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, who was intercepted by the rescue workers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
The workers of the regional operation center took over an hour after Saturday midnight an emergency call with initial information about the fall of the man from a height.
Two crews of the ZZS – medical and medical – immediately went to the spot.
Upon arrival at the site, health officials discovered that a twenty-seven-year-old man was to fall from a window about twelve meters high and hit his head on concrete!
Coal was caught in the v<0xC3><0xAD>tkovice.
But not as it should be, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and a direct threat to his life.
The attending physician intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, his sanitary vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava traumatological center, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Humpl, a spokesman for the ZZS MS region, informed.
I’m more concerned than I am about the Coronavirus because of inadequate public and government responses.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David the Cutter.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
The MMA had a great gala evening full of interesting results.
At UFC 269, things are going well.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> was able to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who did not find a winner for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, performed a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France, who quickly defeated Cody Garbrandt in the technical KO in the first round, also won.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought a women's bantam weight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a.
The American entered into a mutual battle as an imaginary "dwarf", because Nunes did not lose seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper presuppositions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively, and the opponent even gave her a push kick, sending her to the ground.
Money, however, did not allow herself to be forced to make any further mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents had a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Money got Nunes on the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up and unleash the attack.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier did better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active with Oliveira, who tried to tame the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got the opponent on his back and filled him with a series of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to throttle the choke.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
Sean O'Malley won the next match, putting a hard right back on Rauliano Paiva in the first round.
He then scored a series of precisely targeted strikes and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to consult with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years she has lost.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, it is not difficult.
Most substantive names in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not a problem for them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle gender.
But then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantive names, for which gender is not constant.
Such significant names fluctuate between two genera.
When tilting, they then acquire two ends and in some cases remain in inflexible form.
For example, the words "snake" or "cow" are of the male and female genders, in the first they are inclined according to the pattern of "machine", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
In the case of another group of substantive names, different shapes are already in the first drop of the unified number, for example: "row/row", "kedluben/kedluben" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example "cucumber" in the Czech Republic and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-literal, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "dungeon" and "dungeon", "dungeon" and "dungeon" etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inflexible, but gradually they take on Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained inflexible in the middle gender, but in the male has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have moved to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise support for Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing for humanitarian aid.

We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we suffocated, says Sydney reporter
The devastating fires Australia has been battling for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the local authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent drastic impacts, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the context of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhelova is speaking to a Sydney journalist, Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why everyone is always written everywhere.
It is annoying for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how often they are treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
It has become a trend that victims finally open up about their traumas.
But too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s disgusting and spitting into the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is fabricated” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual abusers.
The Czech Republic is flooding its built-up houses, families do not have the money to complete
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a tight spot because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the dismantled family houses and the banks refuse to increase the mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
People don’t have enough money to complete their already-developed homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates an extremely unpleasant situation.
In the best case, people move into dismantled and undiscovered homes.
In the worst case, the built-up houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them, because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and rent," says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We’re going to build two or three family houses a year, and 50 percent of that happens to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to comply with certain things contractually, even if the material has infuriated.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they expected the construction of the house would cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," Slivon added.
Of the material, copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most irrigated.
But construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of labor.
In the Czech Republic, construction graduates are missing and the influx of foreign workers is holding back the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
“Construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're fine, and we'll be even better.
Real visions are missing, says commentator <0xC4><0x8C>RO – mujRozhlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of the United Nations, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What fundamentals have we learned?
I have my own theme that I have chosen, I stick to my bachelor’s degree, I always do it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The Statesmen are completely at peace with us, if one is not a total macaque and has something left in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him in theory.
I was studying for a week and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation that immediately came to me and I was right.
Unlike those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project to them (we have done it many times, really useful, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and have it done.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is a test in which the knowledge gained within the project is projected, not just a defense.
All right, but don't load emails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same pisser they are.
Those people at the embassy may not have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can safely build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the Pu teddy bear.
You might want to give it to him to get Xi Jinping on his ass or something.
I agree, despite the fact that Insta is throwing the sticks under the artists' feet.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, the furt changes which function is more important, whether the like, comment or save.
I've been sick of it lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't afford to do that.
At the end of the day, I’d probably like to see something user-friendly come along that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Declaration of the Parties to the Donbass
The alliance – yes, the breakup – no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the B<0xC4><0x9B>lov<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> forest on December 8, 1991 Boris Jelcin, Leonid Krav<0xC4><0x8D>uk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open pitiful attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly and without regard to the people, the "real"
With one cut of the pen, they "abrogated" a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one session in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately de-industrialized, slowed down agriculture, and separated fourteen republics from the world’s greatest power, which had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the social impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arabs.
There is such a concept in political science as the "vacuum of power".
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and conquered the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into Thursday's dinner.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy this meat on Monday, the chain will discount it on Tuesday to 99 CZK / kg - will you describe to me the mechanism by which this meat by changing its price will become a burden for my digestive system?
Or will I wait until Thursday and this meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK grater and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
This bullshit about when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, corrupt or poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I recently went to Hlavas in Brno and in the basement the ladies handed out some brochure, I always take such things to help the brigades, they can't throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of peasant reason and conservative views of the workings of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I figured it would be some sort of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like he was a good motherfucker, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad about the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please that person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she was crying and begging me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically lock the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then the next half a year went by and she started banging on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up and lying about it, but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some amok again.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are being robbed by buying a cloud of tests and rushing to the positive, who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it wasn't for the test.
The only thing we are achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator were given five days of house arrest.
In the West, they've already stopped the bullshit and admitted there's no value in tackling the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, V<0xC3><0xA1>lek is new and has to steal something else and drive his ego by inventing a buzzer.
I'm watching the good old bastard come back to us again.
After several years of suppression and repression of this nasty business, MLM recruitment is once again back in the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first year at V<0xC5><0xA0>), the initial promises about product training and business skills quickly switched to "you don't need to care, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offered, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and whine.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, that is, one felt like a domestic seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned that one should not jump on every snippet and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People are successful in this business and even benefit people, but they certainly won’t brag about expensive consumer goods or a “fat” account.
I haven't seen much of it in a corporation where I work.
HR is calm, the managers are looking at their management and they don’t put a lot of pressure on us.
So a regular evaluation happens in some way, in the form in which it happens in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Business activities are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels that we are such an almost-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
The Czech Republic is missing in the UK after death.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who was missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation Jakub Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek announced on social networks that a woman from Hungary was found dead.
Unfortunately, this afternoon, the British police confirmed to our representative office in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not communicate any further information on the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the way from work on 28 November, before she had to pick up money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues at work five days later.
The London police searched for her, and Interpol named her among the missing around the world.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have arrested a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects of, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new councillors were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a na Uherskohradishtsku, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice na Mosteck, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves na Liberecku and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> na Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected representatives have disbanded.
There were 99 candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1>, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was given to 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate papers were registered for new elections to the representatives in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for 28 positions.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging, but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal deputies and, above all, elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a quite dangerous infectious disease here, it took me a while at the very beginning, but it was possible without any major hurdles.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population in all its strata stands for it, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the ability to re-acquire it.
The chances of this happening are, as others have said, very small.
Moreover, I am not sure if the file card could be considered a great betrayal at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Are Sexless All Year Round
More and more young adults in the U.S. live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey found that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who give up their sex lives rose from eight percent to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they had not had sex in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having not had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them reporting having had no sex in the last year in 2021.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people are divided on premarital sex, about 30% think it's wrong, while about 70% think it's okay.
“It’s true that among the single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior is driving this trend,” Stone said.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, it is the reason for religious establishment.
Since 2008, single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the “less-than-believers” the trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking during pandemic times.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replacing” this need.
This trend has mainly gripped the lockdown during the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against Covid is about whether a society should force a part of the population to behave that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question that I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don’t order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't give up and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of a stubborn opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and the CCP, is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it can be quite clear that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign on the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic so far.
The operators of the ski resorts will not do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizera fifties.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once in high school, a teacher took us across the city to a shipyard so that we could sail on boats along the river.
On the way there we walked once through such a rather wide street and whom we probably do not see in the middle - the followers of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course they've come down on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they got into a conversation with a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're horribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is to be dealt with in the West using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the “Norman Group”, uniting France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said the chancellor reported on the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross borders.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish religious woman blamed an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver’s license in the absence of a priority in driving and driving from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun had run into the vehicle and asked for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestine.
They took her for a breath test, and after discovering that she had more than two promilles in her blood, they immediately removed her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would testify in court.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> did not watch his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies looked at American stories about pet dogs.
But they have forgotten one important thing: the lawfulness of filmmaking.
After the kitten movie F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people to live, now about the audience emotions in the cinemas is missing another picture Here we watch.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> Jr. freely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch 2012.
The talking dam Hugo and some of the famous characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava pension, who dies, and so begin to call in the dog owners, Julie's father with a partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (who is also a producer of the film) had to deal with the storytelling procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of awe and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to dark delusion in the desire for a child, and if the nurse comes to the right "constellation", she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (of course, during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), she is sent to the nursery.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at how much pelmel of content full of unbelievable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a doggie contest, a <0xC5><0xA0>umava charlatan, cops coming on a sleight of hand to look for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which the roasted family in the pension of course drinks.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and suddenly sits swollen and cigar-painted at the family table and demands her father’s whiskey and whiskey as a cured vegetarian, she cannot help laughing.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that “sometimes this happens after a coma”.
<0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of text work, the ability to construct load-bearing situations, a sense of character and point, and directing.
Acting performances are uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is crippled.
Whether Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vacul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1> or Nela Boudov<0xC3><0xA1> try to stop their party, they do not have much to play.
The only feature of the film are the poetic shots of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and the pair of lakes.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a tricky plot and dog reports, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions the characters use.
The argument is not even an age-old membership in the Club of Breeders of Lakes - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of man with the dog, the knowledge of craft must also be in order to tell a credible story.
That did not happen in this case.
For a good family shot, there's a little bit of eroticism and a little bit of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canister therapy, this amateur-captured piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant reprimands exactly from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercion, here's how you understand shit, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to kids like that, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a brigade for profit.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week’s two-day rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scene, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are shocking and irregular.
In the winter rains are dependent forests.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest source of freshwater, Lake Galilee, has been flooded by the edge of the water this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Economists have warned of drought for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here,” said Uri Schor, a spokesman for Israel’s water authority, in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tanker cars are increasing.
Waterways and private wells are drying out.
“This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years,” Imad Suleyman, a tanker driver, said in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The coryte of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares for military intervention against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had not brought “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reports.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked Miss a bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wanted me to do.
In the end, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I shoved the missus with doubts and questions for a moment and finally thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm screwed, but the pyramid is the pyramid and the financial advisors are the financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, there was a lot of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major attack of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operation.
The downhill skiers were not even denied the obligation to prove themselves with a covid certificate for lifts.
While skiers do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region took to the cross-country trails and to the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased, the opening weekend has really come out since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill," praised the director of the Sports Area Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>.
Hundreds of people went to Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the centre in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk were opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today there were an estimated 400 people.
The conditions are perfect.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Proch<0xC3><0xA1>zka.
Ski resort operators may only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or who are in the period following the transmission of COVID-19.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove with the necessary documents, said René Hrone<0xC5><0xA1> from the <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n ski center.
“We only recorded incident units,” he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is an interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Opava store Skiopava.
Greater stress is expected in the period of skiing courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k, CEO of the Royal Hradec-Croatian company Snowbear, also feels that because of the covid, it is not as interesting to rent ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, there is a great demand for rent in the Novako area on the Bo<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Dar.
The rental of skis started there a week ago and the interested parties already have to order them in advance.
"We start renting runs this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, as we did last year," said the operator of the resort, Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who don’t have any assets go abroad.
The owner of the company will not go abroad.
But with the rest of it, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n winning one beautiful day, reigning for a year, and the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If it's going to be a bad life, it could be a traditional V4 madman.
The young and the educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and the people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
That's a scary picture!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the headquarters of the film Island led by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up shoot?
The London police are still searching for the missing Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic, according to her, left work around 19:45 on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Carnegie acted as an “assistant nurse” at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which is part of the Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
The public is also urged to cooperate by MEP Harriet Harman, who on Saturday drew attention to the Srncova case at a press conference.
“She’s been missing for a few days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably distressed to death,” said a Labour politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel we all have a particular responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and is starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know why he thought Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of a joke, and Russia has Italy’s GDP.
The comparison with the situation in the year 38 is out in so many points that I do not even know where to start.
I can already compare this with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreement, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
Ono, the pact is servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, mainly related to suburban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed routes, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop fast trains from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station.
In the suburban train transport, S7 trains leave, which on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod pass through the main train stations in Prague.
In the recently opened Prague-Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, the R17 motorway from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will be stopped again.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Among other things, there are buses to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tl<0xC3><0xA1> nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Star<0xC3><0xBD>ch Splav<0xC5><0xAF> and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines to Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradec region.
With the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and operations will be adjusted on 12 operating ones.
From Prague Zli<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>n a new bus line 405 will depart, which will go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atka.
A new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k was also established, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be reinforced in the morning and on the weekend the connection from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, when the express line number 404 will be launched.
Newly included in the PID system are lines 400 and 410 travelling to the Liberec region.
They leave from St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not from Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice railway station.
The backbone line 400 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Duba and <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Dubou to Doks, Mimon<0xC3><0xA1> and Jablonn<0xC3><0xBD> in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, new traffic on dozens of local routes in Central Bohemia, including to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mit<0xC3><0xA1>l pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>n, is cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and around Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk have changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy a maximum of pizza fry and snack yogurt and apple.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
It’s not the trees you need to see.
Only the top of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confessions of a Gift about a Relationship with an Ignorant: I Was Not At All Looking Forward to This
The Czech show business pond has been living nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d since Friday.
They've been pulling it together for the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why she has been hiding love from them for six months.
"I can say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara was caught by a bear, so sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn’t look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who don't care at all and jump it on them and from the can, or us whose lives they decipher in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend were suitable enough, or you insisted that everyone should really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, that's what's bothering Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins drove to prepare for their new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d has long served as the vice president of Juventus Football Club.
The truth is, they only went out now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have not been on paper for three weeks.
In any case, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We too are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just like him with me, I stand with him.
Hello, the other commentators have already said about everything essential, I just confirm that the colleges are great to start with, my classmates usually met during the first semester or two and met and hung out and then found sublets together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
Apartments usually don't advertise too long in advance, so now you probably won't find much, but looking at the offer won't hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ozsk<0xC3><0xA1>, etc., this is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jewish Quarter are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> district is very student-oriented, Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovo pole and that way it is fine, besides it is close to most of the VUT faculties (I do not know where exactly you are performing).
I have never rented, but I am a native Br<0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xA1>k, so I can consult with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay it from their own or they go to the state and pay the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because he will spend a few crowns on a full state contribution and will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a man who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about a petition for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the voice against going to an abortion is the same for you as the voice against having a statue in the square?
I'd have consulted with the man who hired you for the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (even long-time professionals) it is either something that fits the eye, or they will write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and to the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in some way in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a decent and hardworking student, you can look at some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But because it looks like you’re drawing from a book, I’d bet that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits with what’s physically on that coin.

Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
This is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, the establishment of super-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English language, it is quite interesting, after the appearance of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred of Ceylon.
I've been working there for three years and it's fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 o'clock in the evening and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly crossed there in his life.
Yes, most of the Roma population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is that they are obstructing on the sidewalk and park where they do not have :D it is definitely not that I would be afraid to go out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I would go for it.
Full of apartments are now there newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without D<0xC3><0xA1>da and Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>’s mistress like a stick in a fence!
Who is he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras's words that he frequented her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy gifts all the time and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
“I’m a gentleman,” added Felix, who himself came to the Richman Club for a music video.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet Lu<0xC4><0x8D>ek Sobota Adrianu’s wife or singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltov<0xC3><0xA1>.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to not occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so even firefighters and nowhere else is the high percentage of health-trained people at this level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend only Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, it has been asking for new toys for a long time.
A record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the water has disappeared in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, a smaller amount of precipitation is recorded even in places where there has been no need for moisture.
The cause of drought, which prevails in much of Central Europe, is climate change.
But the impact also reinforces the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I can barely keep up with ice skating, mushrooms I know what it's like to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a mess.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so lose by two goals even if you do not have to win at any cost the game is different than when compared.
But anyway, as I listen to Czech commentators who sniff out what the referees don’t notice, whether male or female hockey, it’s all weird, but that’s the case with all the sport, UEFA and “Italian actors” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite it is as always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than they have won, it would probably be the classic "they have lost" vs "WE have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest number of days since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" big wave of Omicron-related infections, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK's health safety authority, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with the omicrone are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
No one has died of the omicron so far, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street in December last year, when the lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister argued that the quiz took place “virtually” via a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers on Downing Street.
In the UK, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV Commercial Television for Britain: Boris Johnson won the general election by a crushing majority two years ago today.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
It’s amazing how quickly events have progressed.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for elections in the spring, which could end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
It will be a European-wide election.
How much can we expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not be free either, because they were not even the last two elections under Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can actually vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I repeat, they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
In the past, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the unified opposition.
This is unusual for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n and his party.
Aren't they going to try to keep playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, a recording by the Speaker of Parliament and one of Fidesz’s leaders, L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> Kövér, leaked to independent media, explaining to secret service chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of the new approach you’re talking about?
Yeah, that's one of the news.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, dad has her for a long time, but then she bangs extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I got angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a convulsion and I was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they cheered me up, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
Definitely I have a tendency to deal with things by force now too, as a child I have quite a lot of washing, now I beat myself up to get at least something, and as a young person I beat my parents over my hand (so as not to get too much over my chin), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have this urge.
I'm not able to determine the extent of my explosiveness, but I'm sure that's what education has to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my patience with the kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up, maybe it is not possible to not spoil their children at least a little bit, so it is not.
I don’t know why I should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call Kund<0xC4><0x81>m<0xC4><0x81> those who make the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a lack of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have what mortgage to pay from?

Where will Slovakia take the trial of journalist Kuciak’s murderer?
In Slovakia, the trial of the four defendants in the murder of J<0xC3><0xA1>n Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>r begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
It also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important is the process for Slovakia?
Journalists can do a lot for this.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at an end and there is still no law to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected when selecting and permitting a deep storage of highly radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council of the Government suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of strife.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Warehouse, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Local governments expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their options in deciding on the storage facility, which is promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directives.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law by the Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who has the Platform at his disposal, is rejected by the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a location for storage is insufficient and cannot ensure that the interests of the municipalities and their citizens are respected.
It can only be effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given locality.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Warehouse Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal almost completely neglects public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in authorisation procedures.
The design lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a location for the storage, its authorization and operation.
According to today's legal norms, municipal representatives do not really have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is issued decides.
A possible action shall not have a deferred effect on the performance of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in permitting storage, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and subsequent to the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zem<0xC3><0xA1>nk.
According to the contract register, the total sum for these works is almost 4 million CZK.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the deputy mayor of Cejle from Hr<0xC3><0xA1>dek and a spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Warehouse said: “After the Ministers of Industry, who have only shifted the position of self-governments towards state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we are waiting for new
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The anti-deep storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to enforce a change in the state’s approach to dealing with spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a location for possible storage be conditioned by the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) caused fear to lose weight: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
His new character was featured in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
Roseanne from the sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put it all in my mouth,” the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise, exercise.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still,” Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on which boss and what you want to use the word "boss" for.
If this is some text on the platform that expects the reader from the game environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are many different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, yes, and so the "boss" is something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who do not need to defeat at all to make the game or level complete, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not get along with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is probably not possible to translate boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (interesting is only Catalan, which bosse translates as the final opponent).
It is simply important for a story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The missing Peter of London is being searched by the whole world.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncova since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Hungary has been looking for her since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Petru Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
The whole world is searching for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlova said.
“We are sharing information about the case,” she added.
A well-known search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should have come from Hungary.
She worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearances are very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She got involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face.
“We are very worried about her,” she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who he was and what he had in common with Peter.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, attacks intensified significantly.
A big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla we recorded on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same.
The infected attachment in the e-mail should draw the user’s attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month a dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was labeled as a copy of the repair receipt for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for the stored credentials, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Formbook spyware was also active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic in this case, and security specialists captured campaigns with global reach in November.
Compared to October’s Formbook data, it weakened slightly in November, but is still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The appendix in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity is noted by security analysts at the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6% of attacks and in the Czech Republic in the last few months had no major attack campaign.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The Prague parade was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade on the waterfront and according to my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of an estimate of about 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people really.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the parade of about four thousand protesters.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokry.
That the continued dissatisfaction of several large groups or sections of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-vampires, the anti-vampires and the society themselves would not be able to complete or pay for such a large parade.
Actions of the Choked Dog Association have a rising popularity, it reminds me of a Million Moments for Democracy on the Rise.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be thwarted by this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine doesn't become a square and more dose.
It's definitely not a left or center movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm glad the vaccines saved us.
The ingenious actions of scientists, on which humanity is rightly proud.
At the end of the day, Bulgaria has a new prime minister who announces a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov with forming a new government from the anti-corruption movement We Continue the change that won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in forming a government of a broad coalition, which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties reporting the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
From the “secret” shots taken, it is a global hit.
Concerns over the fate of the 32-year-old Czech have been growing in Britain over the weekend, after which the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> was last seen two weeks ago as she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about a child hospital employee, in addition to the police, her current employer or a member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived is calling.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic, according to her, left work around 19:45 on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Carnegie acted as an “assistant nurse” at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which is part of the Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, an amateur painter of children's rooms (and also a regional pirate council), said anonymously that his paintings violate copyright.
The court, however, recognized that the paintings of Krte<0xC4><0x8D>ka in the smuggler rooms do not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem there was a hole in the road for a month in the form of a canal without a lid.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred to complaints about the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole went further.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to “intensely address the situation”.
