I like the horses.
Agreed.
How much is four-by-six?
I hugged him, Tom.
When were they born?
I have to go to the bank in the morning.
Tell Tom to comb his hair.
Do you think Tom did it?
We didn't play well.
Tom was hungry.
Tom lent me his bike.
Tell them we don't want to go.
She's been spotted.
I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary responds to the teacher's question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're a lot faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter's in love with Jane.
Just keep smiling. Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that to happen.
- Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem frustrated.
Tom knows everything about them.
Have you slept at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you'll get on the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight, please?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk about it.
You're supposed to be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna be home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom's teaching me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
Raw fish is not to my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student, Yutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
It's okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Can I find out where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love the flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Garlic is good for your health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
She's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom was working in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sluggish.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play the guitar. I asked him to play the guitar.
He's hitting my phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is this?
Tom forgot his suitcase in the middle of the train.
They killed our cows.
My name's not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Give it a try.
The phone's ringing.
Tom's living in Boston.
Thomas lives in a community with hippies.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Anybody here yet?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need a lot more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than in the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you dye your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We might need some.
That's a proposition.
How'd you spend your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here, have we a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom's got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you watch baseball on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
He does the same to me, whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be late.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You are not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was still alive.
Thomas's phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
It's about.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
He's in his 40s.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a dictionary of French.
The captain has given us a good name.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Laurie's still in school.
My office is in the city center.
She has two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom interrogated Mary.
Tom's got a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We spent three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you boring.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone yelled.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks fluent French.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost your proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom's your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We've been enemies.
Who's got him?
We have nowhere to go.
How many squares can you see?
This bus is going to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I'm the coach.
Tom's gonna be working this afternoon.
Who's that?
Have dinner.
He convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the puzzles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom says he can speak French.
Tom painted pink on the wall.
We're very busy.
Make it louder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe out of your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy-going.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I was able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I say it again.
Open up the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined it.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I pretended to be asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow made it difficult to see.
Don't apologise.
Thomas's bought something.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your pistol?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom's a Turk.
Can you subtract from ten to six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When are you going on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There was no salt left.
Tom gave us a few apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
Yeah, I know.
I've burst into tears.
He's talking like a truck driver.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came in and made me dinner.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?
I can't say for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid for it.
I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
Since I got married, I don't work anymore.
Why do you hate Canada so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a horse?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
You sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father a Japanese man?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
Tom was a dangerous man.
What time do they start?
I'm stumped now.
I'd have thought about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never have happened in Boston.
I like to play the piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.
She's just as smart as he is.
Where do you feed them?
Tell her to leave.
There are only three of them.
I have more money than him.
He has Ukrainian citizenship.
The name of this song is "Only You".
There's an apple on the table.
Thomas might think you don't like Mary.
Tom was here a minute ago.
Bean lived in singapore.
I saw Tom.
Tom has sold his car to Mary.
I want you to come.
I need his name.
Can I stay in the car?
I have friends in Boston.
I don't speak Spanish.
Tell him to come home.
I can't wait to see the sequel.
Tom usually pays for everything in cash.
You won't enjoy it.
Where's Tom sleeping?
He doesn't smoke.
Tell me the good news first.
You thought I was a Canadian?
Tell them I'm ready.
I need a pen and paper.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom has to stay.
I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
How about a drink?
And the Greek squirrels eat fish.
They were collaborators.
No one encouraged him.
He dreamed that he was kissing her.
What's the title of your new book?
We have each other.
He made the same mistake twice.
Tom's heard Mary cry.
I saw him come out.
Tom will never let that happen.
Can you see me?
Tom's bought a dog.
I like to eat pineapples.
He wants to go to America.
Tom has two brothers, one lives in Boston and the other in Chicago.
I really love you.
How about a drink?
I don't like spiders.
My name is Sarah.
I can't drink tea without sugar.
Welcome to the team.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
The library is on the left.
Are you awake?
Where do you speak French?
You know you're getting old when you have to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercury was.
Who cares?
Tell me which one you want.
First, God.
I know your older brother quite well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom that I went fishing.
All right, try again.
Tom and Mary are in need of help.
The kids look scared.
Tom took off his hat.
I want to see the streets.
Which one is mine?
Algeria is relatively safe now.
Tom's gonna help me.
You're very rich.
We don't have any tea left.
All the guests are gone.
Who Killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I was a Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the discussion.
Note: In English and we delete nationalities, days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You've been guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; I am glad to meet you.
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
He's coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sammy sneezed and shoved into Lyla's toilet.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
The language is a living organism.
Can you help Tom?
Listen, I need to see you.
Tom was driving his girlfriend's car.
We laughed.
Take me with you.
I have to go to bed.
They're both alive.
They'll fix him.
Tom flew out of Boston to Chicago.
Help me to get her up.
This country is very poor.
Could we talk in private?
Is your car black? !
Tom will be there to meet you.
You've made the same mistake again.
Kate doesn't celebrate her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to be paid?
Aren't you happy?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
It's exactly what you need right now.
I did a little research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still shallow, isn't it? My feet are still touching the bottom." "It's pretty shallow beach. Yotsuba, you're still getting to the bottom, right?"
I'm off to London.
I adore dogs.
Are you afraid of losing your money?
It's cold; why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Every time I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We circled for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not literal.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over thirty.
Do not put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you last night?
Tom's John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
He's got a lot of money.
Good thing you want to be honest with me, or I'll tell our mother.
The girls were staring at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like to run.
Sammy says it for your own safety.
I never eat meat.
The vectors do not need to correspond to a physical quantity; anything can be a vector space as long as the addition between vectors and the incremental multiplication have been defined.
His money's in the bank.
I'm very shy.
I love my country.
We have entered into a serious discussion.
They're here.
I think someone likes Tom.
Will you pay me a visit?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You've been guilty.
I'd like to see the party.
As the phone rang, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore the best of her dresses.
Tom is undecided.
Tom can speak both French and English.
Tom foresaw that Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an agnostic.
He wants to learn how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you all right?
This book belongs to Paolo.
It doesn't look like Tom's Canadian.
I don't understand French at all.
They'll fix him.
She's younger than your sister.
Give me the pepper, please.
My cousin's a journalist.
This animal is mine.
I wish I was born in Canada.
I'll be ready on Monday.
Nine in the square is equal to eight.
Can I give it a try?
You're much faster than I am.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Tom's got a brother.
Who shot them?
He writes less and less these days.
Put it on.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pressed his nose into the window.
You're younger than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks that Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I arrived at 2:30.
Maybe you're right.
Oxygen is necessary for combustion.
It's all right?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother's living in Boston.
What are you reading?
All right, thanks.
Only I can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary some money.
Tom's not driving fast.
His current stance confirms what we've guessed.
Tom told me he'd like to fix up Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment has failed.
More likely.
Don't be so hard on your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're lively.
You convinced me.
This is my daughter.
I talked to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
I'm suffering from frequent urination.
And speaking of genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Sammy hired another maid.
I need a little orange juice.
The entrance to the toilet is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we're gonna find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They've voted.
He's the one who wrote the book.
I haven't given them to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary responds to the teacher's question.
Tom said that he thought I looked impressed.
I drink at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't find that word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
Answered the question.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.
I'd like him to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom's failed.
Open up your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of service.
There were so many people in the room that I could barely move.
He's going to visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom's got blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I've got wine.
We got there first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I was eating something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was so hungry.
Run! Run!
They all started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's actually a nice theory. The only drawback I think it has is probably common in all philosophical theories. It's wrong.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October of last year.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to get out of Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very angry now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of noise here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike is the tallest of the three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I assume you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom going to die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unanswered.
I like the Irish music, you know.
Give me a spoon.
How tall are you?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I'm supposed to drink tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has very long hair.
I'm exhausted.
I know her name.
Thanks for coming, guys! I'll see you in the next lesson!
That's Tom's dog.
I know he's hiding something.
Tom shook his head.
I happened to meet her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom's decided to go to Boston.
You don't remember them?
A cough.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
There you go.
Where'd you get the key?
Maybe that's not right?
Tom can't stand the hot, wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight on the phone.
I'll help you in any way I can.
Please, please, tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a very rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Oh, thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He's teaching us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a make-up.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as his feet could.
I like to fish.
I don't like these sweets.
The back door was broken.
I'm feeling younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I've got a doctor's appointment.
Oh, yeah.
It's true!
Can I use your phone, please?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I get you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was really hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I pretended to be asleep.
Our teacher's a real fool.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was very impressive.
Mary is wary of strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door open.
I'm staying here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Speak slower.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom's hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married a Canadian woman.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
You're texting them?
Can I borrow a pen, please?
We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom was working in Australia.
I want money.
Tom's snoring.
Do not turn off the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unfortunate.
Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted on it.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Is Israel going to attack Iran?
I like to laugh.
I've washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating more slowly will help you feel fuller.
I'm French.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
I got up early yesterday.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French is not difficult.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
It all repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.

You need to see this movie.
He drove safely.
Tom knows I'm Canadian.

Whatever you want!
Who are your parents?
I played tennis.
And besides, I don't like wearing socks.
We're both planning to attend your party.
Thank you for coming!

It's too spicy for me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom handles French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's move on.
I want to talk to my lawyer.

I think they're liars.
This elevator can carry ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free.
She's teaching us French.
You're sick!
You think I'm a dictator?

They're lucky.
It's my decision.

You hid the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I get it.
You're still alive.
How old is he?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.

Will you tell them?
It's very slippery.

You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job but were promised promotion very soon.

You need to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like the snow, it's so nice!

Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you all set?
Tell them not to come.
It's not expensive.

I didn't like it.
The cherries are red.
We were both very thirsty.
Why did you paint the counter red?
Tom and Mary were still good friends.
Do you speak a language other than English?
Tom's too slow.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When's your birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It is not difficult to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I've punished them.
Your friend's here.

The house collapsed.
Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate, please?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
You eat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I get it.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all came running out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's in vain.
Tell them it's important.
The party's on Sunday.
We are all Canadians here.
Listen to him snoring.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is this word pronounced?
He saved me.
I've got an idea.
