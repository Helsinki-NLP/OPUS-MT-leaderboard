Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
He will be awarded the diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October out of 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate to charitable works, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
At the time of the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to action" for him.
A Nature Defender Accused of Blackmailing
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police charged the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for his appeal being withdrawn, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting buckets are not scented in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before finding the right buckets.
I do not mean that we would not sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of bins dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the Moravian square opposite Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like it, but it seems damn little to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So, in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It's a good way for them to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except I didn't see any colored buckets on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a supposed aestheticism are not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy from the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after hanging out on the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the whole region of South Moravia.
The budget of Paroubek removed from the silver pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or civil servants there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to put the problems on hold, to mine the ground," said Janota.
It should be noted that interest on borrowed money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not cut social assistance or its spending, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those on the left who have now risen: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - so next year there will not be 163 billion in the treasuries, but more.
In spite of the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Five billion will also be needed to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections of which it is not possible to modify the projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very neatly - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (supplier and distributor of electricity), which the state owns for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing from the two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which should allow online monitoring of each administration's spending.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.
Your Next Smartphone Will Master Two Operating Systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not part of fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization, and customers are expected to have access to devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
The deserted slopes do not pose a problem only to the ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the time being.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only after, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently only offer one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try again for a while, but they're also going to give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting for us at the moment, it is not completely sold out.
There is still free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheap last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell out on average.
This year's interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the January holiday of the Poles and February sells well too," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park of J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow will fall, interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will still certainly grow, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rainfall, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm up, informs Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of a sage, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered himself very simple.
When he ended up sweating his long-awaited doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even the phrase "like in Iraq" several times, he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumed Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which issued recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to the point that the newspapers at present do not talk at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, that is, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the White House's reluctances despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he cheated at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What is causing the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. All of Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a halving of the increase will bear the same fruit as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership from day to day according to their arrangement.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes him perplexed by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "quick return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning negatively.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and if the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of a solution to the problem by the use of military force.
We will have to respond, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any solution of this kind will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only ruse for Obama is that he has three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to embark on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash premiums
Top executives at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from managers in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it planned to allocate a single tax of fifty percent on bonuses from bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
These are five women, a record number, who today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in technical and literary disciplines from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustav.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Elinor Ostrom, and fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith withWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award as he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their appointment on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further exacerbates the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, this is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved the left's proposals for money transfers and increased salaries for civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted on by MEPs, removes the package of austerity measures passed by Fischer's government, which he believes should curb the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but has nothing to do with it, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficit" of public finances.
At present, there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about improvement if it could rely on a broader political party consensus, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek government is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in new Clint Eastwood film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose to the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-eleven-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to embody you, I should be able to see you personally.
The sixty-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Million Dollar Baby set in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement that became himself a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, or even a God who's ever lived.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country’s president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
"I had no other goal but to play this role in a way that brought him closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby’s tough environment.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, it opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of the director Eastwood received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it was damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers refer to Bulava as a "missile that does not fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that the equipment was damaged again.
It was obviously the third-stage rocket engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky who was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely set on fire from a moving vessel and submerged
This is the reason why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object is likely to have been caused by a faulty "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket withstood and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at 51 years old.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry as early as Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury to Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It is not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern a single match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he has twice won gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, won the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k from the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that is still working this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for extra hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend their holidays at the end of the year indicated by Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of unions such as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two extra hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the strike state after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the factory management and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged swindle.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who stopped production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "enhanced" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability science, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Institute of Biochemistry and Institute of Biochemistry Director Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Disputes over the budget. The ODS takes on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, called the approved budget for the following year "frightening" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS's remarks a drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about tackling the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the 2010 budget, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget be a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment about the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or service law reform.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers appointed by the SDGs are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing detrimental, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are claiming TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the leftist majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I did not think about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked on the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SPD would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic deputies to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been criticized by the party president in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew by the time I resigned from my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevism of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek responded in person.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D schedules there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit some of the less-loaded express or regional trains from December 13 and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall by two per cent on the day of entry into force of the new schedules compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino tram.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region by eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which can be opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
The <0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion crowns to pay for visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in high
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route traveled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
AFP reported the incident, but only 65 hostages were reported to have been reported.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 rebels are reported to have used the hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and, on the other hand, because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are currently quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pave".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said at the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and message of Mandela.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters the South African team's national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
To have appeared on the jersey lawn, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people back into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently revealed in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman of the firefighters of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume itself, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not known anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, said <0xC4><0x8C>EZ North Bohemian spokeswoman So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission systems and power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and line tracks with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to sue for defamation against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic prefects today.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated it in Dvacet minut de Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and say that we make the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slander on the company Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
It also indicated that it had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media show that serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He clarified that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will overturn old habits by January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices that health insurance companies will pay for vaccines.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
However, parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450,000 crowns each year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital investigations, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> association indicated that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that needs to be followed now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteering has its flaws.
If all the children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus they would save on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This is, however, related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to get the vaccines bought by insurance companies, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct health insurance sums".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a renowned illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million ($12 million) from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while he was loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such permission, the agency said.
The Labour Party advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were looming.
The decline in Social Security - which will bring in around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the business world, as he says it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline furthermore than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been dropped
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190 per year, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 would lead to “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important and will allow us to double the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year — far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missed"
Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Treasury of the Phantom Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further cuts, contrary to Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and greater reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised by raising taxes and decreasing spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind”.
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the announcements - such as the above-mentioned increase in inflation for certain disability benefits - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending constraints would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures will involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins,” said Roger Bootle, economic advisor to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates 'American arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the news agency Reuters reported, but she said the United States should “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students had been taken from their homes by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iran's 'abuse'
In the last 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents “repetitions of violations” by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the abuse allegations, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"Fake Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-consciousness, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks with the aim of preventing further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a racetrack.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small step preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but this one was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city sparkling below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Awards have rewarded the best voltigs - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night’s party, the snow will be left to the melting.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today constitute a small portion of Muslims in Europe.
Mr. Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual guard elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the area needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motoskiers use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a captivating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not wrong to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the underwater relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice tributary system, formed by the ice-pressed brackish water nets.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 people who laid crowns on Arlington graves
The first-class De'Angelo Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to drop a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on veterans' graves, in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to hold commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shankvaville, Penn.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as children played and couples held hands, wearing fresh pine crowns on grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were standing in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the little black and white information cards, plunged into the wet ground for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to collect at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free... my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’ve disappeared, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs services said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an ever-growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his permissions have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may heighten tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a “soft” approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward with concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro's country as leader.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, brought to trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan with the aim of killing US troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who scavenge the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of the Pakistani tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast became a haven of terrorism.
They were considered to be infiltrators.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization’s recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who show no serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years to choosing the people they accept as U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is more and more on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands of Protesters in Copenhagen Call for Climate Action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center convention palace.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists set off some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when little happened during UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, displaying signs in English saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough".
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the daunting problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.”
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to get the word out and appeal to leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes lit up several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They launched them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, then followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to raise awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating, "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test Results Reveal Persistent Differences Between Races
Last week’s federal report on results in mathematics brought good news to Washington D.C.’s public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the top establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in far greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average white children of Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington, D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the group director of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I’m not jumping for joy for one or two points, said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. Council member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the test results message is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school students who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school careers and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for grade 6 grade 6 kindergarten classes, focuses on games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than the class, Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It’s a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Therefore, this targeting can have political repercussions that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new impressed rather than enthusiastic student.
Super That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says thoughtful, when she was indicated the low ratio professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
While this question still poses broadly for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became teenage parents, they are also hundreds of thousands benefiting from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five "second generation" Hispanics pursued high school -- a notable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having finished high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study bats say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate need for success.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Gets Agreements With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are split with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for the fields put up for auction in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreat, have hampered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Oil Ministry, have been left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has more bids on contracts than other companies and is split with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan.
It appears that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside Pakistan's anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civil secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Officials said suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included plots of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
"It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies," he said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second major figure in al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operatives.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, by about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, at the end of a tumultuous term marred by widespread allegations of corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. schedule for a troop withdrawal that would start in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- which he was grateful for -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. forces relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a barracks of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons “because its people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experimentation solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have distanced itself from attempts at a deal - in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffening of some of the international community’s proposals that they had actually agreed to in early October has prompted the international community, including Russians and Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "with a view to achieving a long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by their city's insufficient birth rate and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don’t have a second left,” said Wang, 31, a human resources director who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
Population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent labor shortages in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive attenuation
Written in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy are likely to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities attributed to the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some government officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the one child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city’s government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home and drag prospectuses under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural suburban city of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for files from couples wanting a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the one-child policy a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only one child because she was one of herself. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone taking care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more strongly.
For middle-class couples working in pairs, who lower the birth rate, he says, one must be selfish, perhaps succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child needs a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reductions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- hitherto characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, following the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with most industrialized nations supporting it.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining hurdles, as much as it illuminated the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a UN task force, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington, D.C., of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General Yvo de Boer described as the “full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent in 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week.
Mr. Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiations, has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked “good sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are struggling to know who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on Copenhagen to obtain a legally binding treaty, although most of the main participants say the negotiations will lead to a political agreement at the minimum.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of the small island states “put political pressure on the full political process,” partly by what they are now unified and that they call on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on resolving most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
Senior officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister stepped off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend in-house meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- where 13,000 people come in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar-playing activists perform nighttime shows mocking countries they believe are betraying each other, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global conservation policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will sound at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, the duration of business trips will be much shorter, and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental dangers are likely to slow down Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will hand over its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another branch going north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it will be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When this is done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making it the fastest British network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m length and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham route.
A terminal with a capacity of 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is anticipated that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to run off the high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, a top Tory MP, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his riding's home.
The party leader who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "entertained", increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a control of members' spending. Last night, Mr Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his district of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orangery.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Commons Standards concerning his provisions on prior borrowing.
The Committee acquitted him last month of any allegations of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan from his London property to the house of his riding that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was unchanged at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate has risen from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, with no change since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the phantom cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him declaring that members of parliament had to survive "on a budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live 'on a budget' and you're treated as 'of the m...e'
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>1 hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn to protest after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the Fee Office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with stealing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come all to see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30pm to 6.30pm, every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why are we waiting for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea for the beach cabin Advent calendar came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people rallied on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, a hundred thousand, according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital came shortly after the march left, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, smashed windows with pavements and hammers, a reporter from AFP said.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, according to them mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were interrogated "without distinction", stressing that one hundred of them "were still held in the street Saturday evening "squatted and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the march, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying to each other: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "joint climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators also called for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to take part in this first election after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total occupation by Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused several thousand deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with lush landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Extensive signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed almost everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who have come to monitor the conduct of the vote.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
"I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, said, lifting a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented on the ballot by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the ground, called nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament's party, the march, generally a good child, took the lead at the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the march left, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, a journalist from AFP said.
Anti- riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without cleaning, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have the extremist groups in our eyes, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the law enforcement were flying in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by car and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "join climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut-off between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized a number of personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators also called for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Geo-history comes out reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were coming out "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
Now, primary school students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared shared culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we need to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S-sector is no longer a scientific field" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-divisions of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of terminal history-geography in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to remove compulsory education from S-terminal history and geography. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this removal, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an admissibility test that will cover their discipline, then at the end of the year an admissions test that will cover their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 then will be a first year in front of students as intern teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in the National Education".
He also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (IPCC), who was invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute expert speeches, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from AFP said.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
About 20 speakers are selected from among the experts in their discipline and are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these lectures will be posted online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delayed Payments: Anger of Prison Supervisors, Planned Actions
The unions of prison guards called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd syndicate of supervisors) has asked staff who will not be on duty to protest Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block" them, to "report the theft of their dues".
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", finding "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all overtime has been budgeted, but ensures that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation resulting from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The salary in December will therefore be low, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, the Ufap/Unsa deplored, for whom "the budgetary constraints are good".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille, indignantly announced its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, i.e. for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, believes the CGT-Penitentiaire de Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly affected than others.
But in any case, the account is not there, said the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers “Better Tricks” Than Those He Receives
US President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family at the White House, told the small screen pope Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: “I give things cooler than the ones I get.”
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the New Year’s holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be in the game.
The Santa also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama was false about her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying with humor by pointing at the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”.
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw at Christmas.
“I remember this time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball,” the president said.
It was not until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to arrange a house so I had all the furniture aligned against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, adding that these injuries had "needed reparation."
The singer's press service, however, reassured that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
He was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass" but ensured he didn't worry about the rocker, who is "a batterer".
He had called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured himself that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "suppressed".
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on with a “little colon cancer,” then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been commented on, and fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/little basin: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the large pool, won an international title on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while waiting for a breakout.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims men's relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who stood on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who prevailed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Just like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
Originating from 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the large pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless prevailed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t really get into this race.
I knew I couldn’t break a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola-owned sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday $1.5 million, well above his estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and babblers, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of the Roman and Egyptian art auctions at Sothe, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this batch is certainly the one buyers have bid on so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of the Maréch.
There remained a shadowy area of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Abortion attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe-run by the Putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya in the evening, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The Putschist government “has experienced another failure in wanting me to resign ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the Putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
“I do not ask for asylum in any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the fallen president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced its headquarters.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the putschist government’s position.
This demonstrates the government’s marginal character in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" which is accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures reflecting the resumption of activity from both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index gained 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But that remains anecdotal, she said, believing the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Avalon Partners’ Peter Cardillo, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite to a worsening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against all expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and the 30-year Treasury bill rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of proponents of power conspiring "Dames in white"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government snooped on Thursday wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Dames in white", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were smuggled into the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from AFP said.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came to “ensure their protection”.
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the “Dames in White” in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers in civil custody, a reporter from AFP found.
Police forcefully drove dissidents into civilian vehicles who were smuggled in by supporters of the government, according to the reporter.
Interrogations of dissidents in similar circumstances generally lasted only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners," 200 of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence, said in a statement.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms of expression.
A forcibly killed an octogenarian with a knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five others in the town centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour's notice, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, police sources and witnesses learned.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of that same pharmacy, he then took on a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman subsequently became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forced man.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the level of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to interrogate the gunman and were wounded with punches, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very serious wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s was stabbed to death.
It was the national police who arrested the man who had no identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office seized the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Judicial Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forced of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a case of morals more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced three California Second District Court of Appeals judges for serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
I call for the abandonment of charges here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- had discussed, before serving his sentence, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which constitutes a serious procedural misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated at the end of September that he had “lied” to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while contemptuous of his authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "that there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to demand the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer tolerates being harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second straight month and much more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rose sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
However, the indexes have been slowed by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pulls down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.540 percent from 3.482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year Treasury bill to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already earned their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and lived so many experiences!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
"We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown," Miss India said with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and, of course, in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates did a safari like last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will probably remain the Cape (southwest) draw for the June 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I met people I never thought I could get close to.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, said Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday 'very positive' news, says son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he was going to go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort, to keep him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to be re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning where their daughter Jade is attending a school show, a photographer from AFP said.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitye-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were ousted, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible legal process to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it had amazed me, since I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted several times by the court, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and which is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the procedure had been "perfectly well carried out" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Association raises the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem, reacted on Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardini party, urging him not to use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF acronym, judging that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be dispossessed, came out of his silence to launch a warning to the minister and the deputy, summoning them to no longer use the abbreviation and to pass on to them the ownership of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to take over the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your activist material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +Today's UDF+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, the UDF office said, urging the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF's name from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate entitlements".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of filing the acronym UDF to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for himself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one does not have the right".
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to try the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenarian for spoiling part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to report before March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will talk to him about it," Mr. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has sued Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-to-everything artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or billboards.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor once again felt that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge in recent days refused to comply with her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees, recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about getting employees to adhere to determined "values" from above as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought by them.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires all stakeholders ... a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires commitment from employees that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would involve putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incentivize this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done!
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leverages" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental finding: for employees, engagement for the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a way to realize some of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life plans.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on the right track”.
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: 'Just War' Worth Praising Right-Wing Obama
The U.S. right on Friday hailed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo the day before, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize championed the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who had bragged about the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, like Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a right-wing Republican, to USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the “sometimes necessary” theme of the war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this all-too-historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former nominee, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a left-wing president" reminding Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush pen re-converted columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "dark, blistering and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable for the position of president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a “super-production” even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama “spoke the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, judging him “both dark and uplifting.”
Roads: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ends the word of the strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" about this agreement, after several negotiation sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement early in the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it still took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but we’re starting from a long way off, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either way, we will give orders to our activists that there will be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel costs, and general road transport status in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to first apply to companies affiliated to this organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "deception market" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not at the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on RER A, France's largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, while a Friday meeting on the second day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership left them hungry for their premium application.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, as a result of one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from the west to the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran in rush hours, and almost no trains in rush hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no hug on the quays, as the French had organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the resort of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and a half earlier, to make sure he was on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned a staffing and law enforcement.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut were arriving or departing from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "weak" by the unions, of a meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "was not crazy to solve a problem while in the road users and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of the profession", the RATP said.
This also caused the unions to say that the company "laughed at the weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a concern for appeasement".
The conflict threatens to spread to RER B on Tuesday, following a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, including 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million of travelers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shifted schedules, on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish judiciary dissolves pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focal point of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the court, Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that deputies would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to stifle Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city populated by the majority of Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also lamented the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall.
What Wolfgang Brauber wants is a very strict winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) points out that this is not to bother the citizens.
It is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it might well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The EDF follows here a very elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes busy streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1,040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the service of the FES starts at 3 am "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migrations begins".
When it gets harder, it’s when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 a.m.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service tells us, "because no motorist is willing to let salting vehicles through".
Then, if it no longer snows, we deal with access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets off to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
As for cycle paths, EDF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger points out that there is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors the condition of the bridges between 10pm and 4:30pm.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service if necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m tall, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with scissor claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to feature these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangaea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique to a Triassic sedimentary layer.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it after Tawa after the Indian word Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores)which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds with a long neck, and those which make up the triangular part of the ori.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues suggesting that the Tawa hallae possessed small air sacs in its bones at the skull level, as did birds that are descended from theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also possessed airbags and a light skeleton, it can be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. the whole of the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the journal Science Studies says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaurus, that lived in present-day Poland and that belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs became the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of modern crocodiles and many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, thus fostering the development of many new species, while others, related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favored meteorite unfolded a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since then had been vegetating in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English theycondemn the intervention of the police requested by the steering committee of the university.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in a strike after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own classes."
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing solely on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee thus withdrew from the debates which would, however, be indispensable.
Curriculum providers demand that the criminal proceedings instituted be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Verdi’s regional youth secretary.
As for Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden regional parliament on Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research facilities are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established ties with Riedberg, Frankfurt’s place of science – with the university institutes and the societies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will leave for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchanges
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It houses the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armaments research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be put high enough.
For his supporters, it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main line stations, with tracks ending in the city, had a reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transport technique that acted as a brake pad for modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to get the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That’s why the main train stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project is really about to begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer really pose problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with motorrails and pilot car at both ends.
However, the realisation of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken over.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who makes the expense of the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if you believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which was attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The Department of Transportation list lists a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to put a lot of pressure on the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on track to become the bottleneck for international freight traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
The Government is considering the judgment rendered regarding the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing against the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to review the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view, which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the construction of the northwestern runway of Frankfurt Airport would take place.
The permission to land for 17 aircraft between 11pm and 5am, as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to appeal against the ruling.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and tries to pressure the government representative to dismiss the appeal before the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, this will be said to be a total breach of a given word.
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises”.
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "law enforcement and robbery".
It takes time for a specific legal review to take place.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. Banks Refund Allotted Aid
The big US banks, hard hit by the crisis, are breaking free of their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (over 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's cash registers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of the Bank of America, expressed his express gratitude to U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had presumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to procure money in the financial markets in order to free itself from state supervision.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, CNBC reported, citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated Elections
In the end, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the removal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from the board of directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF’s Berlin editorial team, was the big favourite.
However, the channel did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF's steward Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract by five years, but this had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Board voted in favour of Brender's re-election and seven others voted against, and the dismissal by vote of Brender was a far-fetched but foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority member of the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want to reinstate Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that ZDF's information broadcast listening rate had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, blaming the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (national daily German).
In 1983 he became editor at the ZDF first in the "heute-journal" (today's newspaper) news magazine.
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (two-monthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF.
After Brender’s disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck is not considering requesting the removal of political figures who are members of the ZDF's oversight committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to release Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of putting a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to finish their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the burden of examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also pledged to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master programmes.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulation from one country to another.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the Rectors of Universities have constantly spoken of the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Council has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a thirty-page document on the future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of exams, one should be able to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to student eligibility.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if this feeling of choking that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses cannot be avoided.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and the room for manoeuvre necessary to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not overburdened and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialised higher education institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country that has agreed to provide more funding for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutoring programs and strengthen pedagogical guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Service
The Länder and universities have a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be needed to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will need to be more flexible, the recognition of scores from other higher education institutions will need to be ensured and access to the Master will need to be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of study conditions in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Students' Union said he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and opportunity for every Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, Member of the Steering Committee of the GEW, furthermore asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students, that tomorrow there will be enough places for master's studies and the best possible study conditions.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing sentences the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently a collection manager in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hesse literature forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a congress in Munich, the theme of which was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
In 1989, Söllner received the German Language Prize together with some of the participants.
Enrollment testing had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “someone who has not sufficiently resisted attempts at intimidation by the Securitate.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary rifts with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowliness of a political system, based on police surveillance.
Werner Söllner is, as far as current knowledge can tell, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims made speculations and sometimes guessed what real names were hidden last borrowing names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in recent years.
It was not until 1999 that a National Birthler Council was created to work on the assimilation of Securitate Archives (CNSAS), but the return of files has rather been delayed since.
There has been a law since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very contemptuous way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, we had only questioned her once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case, as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's confession, let us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults in the Champions League
One had the impression that a representative was arriving, drawn with four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, a plastic handbag from the supplier.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but we had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because it was now that it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight to not fall back".
The “big work” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced again after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Lottery draw
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16./17. + 23./24. February / match return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderated only in the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "soul plumber" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer had any effect with the caretaker Babbel.
Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, said: “In football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that we never thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's method of work: "This is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs toughness.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad awakening four days later at Leverkusen with the 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult path.
That Heldt’s 40th birthday doesn’t have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would argue, in response to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been suppressed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” held down Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two quadrennials.
In any cast, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large extent in success" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man in the plastic bag acquies<0xC3><0xA7>a.
World Heavyweight Championships in Athletics
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturally.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimous consent of the judges, the points were settled.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point victory in the unanimous decision of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Earlier, the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39-times winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's shots, thus preventing Klitschko from getting into the game against his dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having surpassed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a “bad zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During Friday’s weigh-in, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to abandon without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is considering playing this match now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche (left) parties are asking the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister has intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak before the federal parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs. Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts as to the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the tanker truck attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two senior officials, however, suggest that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the ministry declined to comment on the allegations and referred them to the federal parliament's commission of inquiry, which was set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality confound.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can indulge in the craziest dreams and fantasies without hindrance.
However, he who, awakened, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at worst it is madness.
But even though the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with bright colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he flies at the raz of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimaceful devil creatures, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Toning voices, mean, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, making it a loop and attaching it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop detaches.
Let it be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir to rip out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people involved can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the door to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and can not act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains make these kinds of convertibles is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers assume that the individuals involved have minor brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if, however, there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains heat up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses, but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brains heat up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having hallucinated at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A young girl doing everything normal, to be honest.
If only there were no pictures and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she responds, her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure of it.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even perceive its presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy? she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to attend the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her bedroom, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grim faces or the girl with bloody incisions on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or iron.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they would take her for a fool.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she came into contact via the internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the chances are high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called dad, since she was of the age of thinking, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "is held in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of the so-called onyroid experience, a particular form of the dream-awakened modification of consciousness.
Onyroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The onyroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us men, so as not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his onychoid experiences in his book "Changing the Heart" as a saving action for the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his consciousness leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created from scratch, visiting foreign places, traveling through time . He sees himself as an old man alone in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than actual experience.
The intensity of this experience makes the horizon of our other daily experiences burst, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, onyroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of wakefulness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall.
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take the rest of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as the CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to join the company, 69-year-old Hubert Burda told Spiegel.
All the details have been arranged in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be asked later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President and CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he took over the Treasury sector, which means that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda says the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have let themselves be driven by capital bullying, who have made huge unfortunate speculations that they could climb higher and higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself as the preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, laser hair removal specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” who guide the steps of customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogans of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied décolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip themselves with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, created the “LIVE OFFICINA”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
Oficina LIVE (Logistics for the Installation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish agreements regarding mobility, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardization groups and has a number of complementary projects underway such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a “future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, sees “a future of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, constitutes the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have a landscape of abandonment and closure of some of our main production sites today,” the President said.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which constitutes our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, put in place in collaboration with Autonomous Communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which rose by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It has an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
You will not only find motorcycles and collectible cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, reviews, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of cars, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Ability Testing Outdoors
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with cars and motorcycles collection will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good grade it has achieved as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine start and stop system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most in-demand Mazda3s are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipments, the track change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensors, the remar, the blue
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes elements of adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly evident in the quality of the materials used, in its behaviour and in its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive a lot of kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version combined only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
The “First” Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain type of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and it’s been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The European Commission’s repeated calls to order to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of their home country, they are hesitant to use the data, and they are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon when it doesn’t have Wifi) offers this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network more profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no gala.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a lifetime access purchase option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I want it simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is arguably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she indeed chose the same to accompany him in the second, no doubt, most important moment of his life: the delivery to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States followed in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and chose to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the function, on the other hand, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing it the previous time.
75% of working mothers had occupational problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study “Women’s fertility and professional career in Spain” has revealed, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have a unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are reluctant to enter couple life and early pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of commencing life together,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the marriage age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 years, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle- or upper-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, tuning the universal motto "Because I am well worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, from yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, are named Best Model of the Year.
The poker ace of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do this according to the foreseeable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: “In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the knife blade that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: “L’Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed from the north side, on which the best climbers still let go and still take it.”
About William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to carry its echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did so in flight from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticons."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she fell to her knees and prayed, ‘My God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: “On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: “Sleep after effort,/ after storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death rejoices.”
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally accepted that she would tell her that Edward VII was spying on her between the azalees or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was beyond madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: “What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if it’s not trying to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What is Benet trying to do if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did this do except to aspire to the glory of this man so that he might serve as a pedestal for him?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed by her and our dog, a blood-mélé, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilograms, and without saying a word, they gave her two kicks that left him grieved.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack for free a small defenseless animal that, in addition, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she offended these individuals, became afraid for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, in the end, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday as well as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been groaning all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint at the district police station, even though we doubt that it serves much and to avoid touching the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.

Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products,” and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the two-wheeled helmet, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop increasingly safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news needs to be nuanced, as the benchmark for comparison, November 2008, was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
However, the large clouds that affect their demand have not dissipated, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In view of this situation and in contrast to passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, they can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers’ association foresees a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for passenger cars and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impacts.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has concluded that it will need more time to plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, understands that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with either of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to slim it by just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to avoid, in the first place, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank with tires for sports cars from 64 to 54 liters, montes from 19 to 7 kilos of gain.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on California secondary network roads in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, including at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at low speeds for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine's roar, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it is at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants were barely present throughout the journey, while on some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “bad girl” or a “it girl”, it is a “bag girl”.
Baskonia offers itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a striking triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the arduous terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She thus sits at the top of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points, was the best of all.
The Vitoria team managed to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, hinted that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already hinted that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from that, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that it was not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "Elia's hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the yellows taking advantage of the luminous (50-49).
Other Difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, needed to chain up some skilful actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and with the help of English and Ribas, managed to finish the counter at a sprint.
Avala's team came out to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take from them what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic's players didn't rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of the fight, between the North American leaders and Beverley.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on the Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the lead 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
Impossible uphill
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even equalled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the group's head chancellor.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian centre-back Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How Much Should You Be Paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from more than 140,000 job vacancies available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week the app has been running, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a French programmer receives 31,059 euros, while a Spanish programmer receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet over the past three months have been for drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to leave the diplomatic legation by January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, after his term of office, he has to look for another destination.”
The channel also cited the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty resurfaces, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conforming liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their bidding for a year next week.
As a result, investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reductions.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond gaps are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the safe havens chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is a new decree.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirs to regain their place in power in the Emirati and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt gaps increase in line with European corporate obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were reduced and ours continued to increase, it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, in addition, coming back to their burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the time being “prudence is the mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, at eight o'clock.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between this date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60 000 million but 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and the power will have to be increased.
His bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, he considers that an additional 18,000 MW is needed, along with other “supporting energies”.
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the government's recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this regard, despite the “on-time” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial Wins Aer Lingus Handling Market at Ten Airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and at airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia at Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealer.
The City Council wants to be able to do so by the end of 2014.
After selecting public/private collaboration (PPP for initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia will compete, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Bauderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Welsh public works company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link, is intended to link the western Toowong Highway to the periphery to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 kilometres of tunnel.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the bidding will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to do much to make Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company ceded the project to build the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been tasked with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction site is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's publicity
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that submitted to the Renfe call for tender, including four finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the country’s Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
An app store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary has followed the trail of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million euros, placing them in third and fifth place for the clubs that earned the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
The competition allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spaniards) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this division.
The white club was the third on the continent to make the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, although they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money brought by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are dedicated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four squares.
The champion of the previous year received 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch a Public Offer of Acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible buyout offers and legal proceedings from her former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the loan to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court yesterday that they had been informed of the hijacking of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion PPO presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion PPO presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The monitoring agency explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory memorandum submitted, following the amendments applied on December 2, "sufficient".
CNMV said the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been immobilised, and that they could not be transferred in any way before the completion of the offer, the price of which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Tools for Car Expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been damaged are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a lengthy and complex task.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service and solution providers for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and drives have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphical image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-sales car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for managing broken parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional Internet sector that allows bidding on declared wreckage vehicles.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious damages for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or vehicle maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a landmark product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per annum over the past three years, and it generated a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it undertook its process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global sales (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the US$1 billion stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of US$2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles damaged.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex procedures.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, increases or discounts, and then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated man-hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
