The Republican Strategy of Resistance to the Re-Election of Obama
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral falsifications.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that cases of election falsification in the United States are rarer than cases of lightning death.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States over a decade.
One thing can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organising federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were passed in a single year in 2011, restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require the voter to present a photo ID and proof of the existence of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will, and deprive citizens of the right to vote who have a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana’s law.
The Republican authorities hurried to spread this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the required voting age, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by their state government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates - are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their educational institution.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use for voting the certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
This requirement was first introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American people.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 that abolished the registration of voters on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to add about 10 million citizens to the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African-Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s total electorate.
The same thing happened with the Latin American natives.
Representing only 11% of the electorate, they made up 24% of the citizens who voted early.
In contrast to whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, only 46% of those who voted prematurely.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This has helped to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring photo IDs to be presented.
However, the new rules that came into force would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing them as a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that states that pass these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the college of electors to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer: to pass the test or not?
In fact, a PSA test sometimes gives false-negative, and sometimes false-positive, results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergo dispensation, have more to doubt.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and difficult to produce any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found different levels of mortality in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30-40% higher in those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting at age 50, or at age 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and slow-moving.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the obligatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
I would recommend that you take the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate all the pros and cons of passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this figure would have risen to at least 50 percent,” said Andre Bollier, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
This is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous harm to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said Andre Bollier, a Quebec-based spokesman.
A encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight (weight)
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Feeding
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by soaking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," - explained in the Association.
Vitamins (vitamins)
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact of vitamin D on cancer development, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bolio emphasizes that it is important to discuss his anxieties and family history with a doctor.
"The delivery of the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the news that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused real excitement — and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
Moreover, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted within the framework of the Standard Model - our best, or at least the "least imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has not previously been detected by experimental means.
But physicists are not yet sure that this is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet enough for complete certainty.
Let's imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, because the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" in the same characteristics, is the "state behind".
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-ordered citizens, called farms, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
In another there are bosons, a hideous gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can quietly find themselves in the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force", through which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which in some way the bosons are removed.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it’s because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “particle of light,” which is a “curator” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, about like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of "force carriers".
A more stable field.
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like the one that operates in CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never hold itself in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photons, by the way) do not.
So, what “can bring” all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of SM.
In addition, some of them passionately long for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest inconsistency can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the Model's holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for the dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But so far, no such discrepancies have been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefit of these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs could not even guess what a revolution their work would cause.
They predicted their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bella Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered more like a "laboratory gag".
Suppose...
In addition, the application can be found for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same William Boyle during his optical studies in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not at all its original purpose, now serves as the “eye” for all the digital cameras in the world and earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0x7C> "Debt"
The Commission for a Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive end-of-life issue.
The debate is expected to resume soon, and a bill is being drafted at this time.
However, there is still much to be done in this critical area.
"Dolg" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the palliative care shelter of Victor-Gadbo in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at the table, where there is an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before an ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
“Throughout life, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbou’s shelter.
Regressing to the state of the child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
“Everything depends on a person’s ability to cope with decline,” he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the palliative care facility of Victor-Gadboa are all suffering from cancer.
The forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing the so-called “curative” help.
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid to die "in consciousness of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says, before letting her put on a mask to ease her breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days for her son’s last visit, who came from Italy.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadboa with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
That's very little, given that sooner or later we'll all die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
To the dying we will agree to provide mouthwashes of brandy or pepsi, despite what he asks.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the legs of the deceased.
“We help loved ones, as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadboa, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboa shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbua shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this huge gap in Quebec’s health care system that makes many palliative care practitioners fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and assists suicide.
Starting in October, a manifesto signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mountain and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, circulating and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not efficient enough to provide the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
“Recently,” she says, “I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Ellen Richard’s survival were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not fulfilling their request, after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until he dies, either occasionally or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to feel better.”
The creation of this reportage was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Large-Scale Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists on the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system" surrounding the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and others.
The “industry” that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot of money, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how this system is disintegrating after all the funds have been put into action," jokes Jacques Duchenne, a deputy and former police chief in Montreal.
It was thanks to him that the scandal erupted in 2011 as a side effect of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then Prime Minister of the Liberals, Jean Share, reluctantly agreed.
The Du<0xC5><0xA1>eno Report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts,” he said, if some had held back their instincts to take part.
The Charbonnot Commission has “already moved two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will “open up the schemes behind individuals.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The case was joined by the 2011 Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Hammer", which after 2009 forced the "stock cartel" of Montreal, to stop the exaggeration of the value of the contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been carried out and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Markott, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Gilles Wyancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec, is next in line.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, the official indictment was filed against several Montreal communications engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a real bomb, leading an investigation into the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trumble's party United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito plundered money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals, who were then in power.
He also admitted to illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost was exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked tirelessly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: for ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and bribes for a total of $ 736,000.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they were getting on the paw, exaggerating the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then one of the organizers of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumpble of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party coffers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trumble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the Riviera de Prairie County in the east of the island, she has faced the sale of a municipal plot, bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom since 2010.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually begin, she will “pull a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the ants-infested system to stop the gangrene and identify the culprits.”
She describes this process as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we're going home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchenno notes for his part that “officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who knew about this scheme” but were not involved in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in the funding of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit the donation to $100 to the parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and party funding: “We cannot go down; if we take a bold look at the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dushenno calls on those who laugh to look into their own backyard...
PSG - not FC Barcelona!
This season you have achieved an extraordinary scale in PSG.
How would you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but perhaps also by the new dimension of PSG.
The great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not burning up.
From the very beginning at the NIF Preparatory Centre in Clermont-Ferrand to my arrival in Saint-<0xC3><0x89>tienne, I have always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
It is not new to play matches of a very high level to replenish this summer.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be at the level and put out to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Macelle, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - the master of the situation?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he is unmatched and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with some great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified in the one-eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to accept the return match in one of the eighth finals.
Will PSG be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League, as in the last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
We were close to that last season.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points presupposes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It’s normal that a lot is expected from us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Trudeau and we are still found to be something to criticize, of course, it's a bit upsetting.
We ask ourselves what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to make it to the eighth final for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we presented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a contempt for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won as a result.
PSG seems to depend entirely on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "gold addiction."
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star of the world.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking a little bit of playing time.
I saw a lot of things out there, and I got out stronger.
Today I am able to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism at the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Desham at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the squad for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
Who was Lauren Blanc?
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blan achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Is a well-deserved draw (1-1), drawn on October 16 in Spain, a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone was fighting for everyone.
"Before that shock in Spain, there have been no matches like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current exchange of money based on central banks numbered transactions between the receiving parties and commissions for their processing.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is clearly a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (nickname), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros ...) and a protected exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been recorded from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in the system in its report on virtual currency published in October.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote the video game, which are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually happens between two e-mail addresses, just like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is given the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hashing phase of a file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" everyone together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would very quickly (in less than ten minutes) want to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not affect the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Nouaze, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Gigant Sales" was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Ion Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which deals with the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouaz, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which thus comes out cheaper.
The owner has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
All you need to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Nouaze clarifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“It will take some time before Bitcoin is established, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, proposes, by the way, to revise the various risks that are considered high today, in case of success of this system.
We have left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. must follow them by the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We were mainly affected by the Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer exist once the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the obscurity of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women subordinate.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into dealers taking over state lands to resell them for construction to returnees returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
The public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to secure the jobs of these young people who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, likes mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and which look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders in the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial wives who would not obey the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to some extent decentralized, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were there only to conquer them.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without the means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining of minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a great extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: lyceum for girls, for boys, French-language faculty at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, archaeological support.
Since 2009, in the quest to "conquer hearts and minds" and perform the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of "military-civilian activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012 the employment of a large number of employees, together with a small French public organization, the way
These works, with the intense involvement of local labor, were able to help deter the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and increasing the area of arable land.
What are we going to leave in memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrections led by foreign groups, which the farmers wanted, as they told me, it was necessary to give them a little non-military support that would be well controlled and dealt with directly.
Difficult Births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a risky new move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play the va-bank.
Surprisingly, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "violate this word" and "violate the right".
In the camp, his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself extraordinary powers” which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around . . . time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were set incorrectly.
The text, which was still voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
"Lycemery," answer the liberals, who see it only as a pira.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because “people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can see the rise of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulems, but people with a university education, some were trained in the French system," reassured Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around article 220 there may be ambiguity, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to the "fikh" [Islamic jurisprudence, see ed.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy remains, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles talk about the protection of women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled to take place this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop Earth and the sea from the solstice
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the primacy of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this "bath" is deprived of God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all there is a sanctuary in Jerusalem.
Believers here go through the Way of Grief or the Way of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonius - Pretorium - where there was a trial, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the Temple of the Tomb of the Lord on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of the Salvation and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Dove of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in the place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for Jews - the Wall of Crying, left from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave notes here with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip vertically.
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on sloping rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about mountaineering can get to them by their own way.
The rest is delivered to this historic summit by a cable car lift.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
From the foot of the mountain, a shuttle bus takes him.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to the ancient tradition, the pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can't visit everyone in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, paintings by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akko you can visit the Al Bash Bath Museum, which is several halls of ancient Turkish baths with mules of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth going to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth – the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
They deserve the stars.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there as well.
Recuperate
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea bathes even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is brine, which is easy to keep floating even those who are not able to swim at all.
The landscapes around are unreally beautiful.
They come here to go through a course of treatment with salt water - rapeseed, and healing mud, and to cure health for dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to put in order the shrivelled nerves.
To touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shore of the Mediterranean.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you hit the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo session.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on a note
When going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know the Russian language.
It is better to take money for a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa - the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower Town with the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all forms of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There are a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, balls of ground walnut - phalale, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats, who valiantly "walk on their own".
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlicks love people's places and don't give up on catering.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance, $15 a day.
And the rental of a bicycle will cost 15 checks. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest the most.
In the Promised Land from January to October 2012 visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than the same figure in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
“Great and Mighty” will bring to Moscow: migrants dig money on the tongue
While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that they will pass a law on mandatory language testing, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, trading "lip" certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families who remain in the homeland.
On December 1, the law entered into force, according to which every migrant will be required to pass the exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of service, housing and utilities, household and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, it will be necessary to give not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law does not apply to people who were able to obtain education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, MSU, SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press the question: what will it actually give?
What will change the obligation to know the language for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service say, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Very many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, do not know the language, do not have medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will shove him into a creepy tight barracks, where he and dozens of others like him will linger for months without food and documents, inhaling for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are deceived, taken passports, not paid the promised salary," - confirmed the head of the main department of labor migration of the Tajikistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue with me, mercenary!
However, while many citizens of Central Asian republics going to earn money in Russia, admit that not only do they not know the language of the country they are seeking, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a meaningful primary education.
After all, their families have nothing even to feed the children, not to mention to dress them properly, shoe and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys go to earnings at the first opportunity.
It’s hard if they don’t know the language, they admit.
“You feel humiliated and undervalued.”
Human rights defenders, however, point to one important point with regard to the language law.
The tests will only be conducted for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Foreign Entrance Banned"
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason - in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea are asked," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Fly, don't covet, buy a painting"
On the very first day of the entry into force of the language law, it turned out that it was not only migrant registration documents that were faked.
Several "lip" certificates of passing language tests have already been confiscated by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they were given to the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, who hoped to ease the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost the migrant worker 3,000.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "shortcuts" could not be simply bought, both the representatives of the authorities and the human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, the authorities can promise to guest workers who failed to pass the tests the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, people who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into account the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: Press shootings at weddings, when there were no victims, and the massacre organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people died.
Police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age from which you can get a gun license - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “turning the nuts”.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of different public small-scale organizations - demand to abandon "meaningless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer-criminal Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies were committed, while in the same period alone, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the “black” market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is an "army or military trace", that is, a weapon that was stolen during hostilities in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were drawn by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
The lamb explains that this includes both those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "guns" go on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were made specifically to cover up the shortage," the former military official said.
Their contribution, according to Barantz, is contributed by the manufacturers of weapons.
“There are now private weapons factories that are not able to withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from the ground to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns are coming from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its production, sometimes craft, and a mafia was formed that organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where's the gun?
The experts estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public-Government Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there "by officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of weapons production, 5% are due to "black archaeology".
A sales consultant at one of the arms stores, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapons found by black excavators have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, after the new batch, the sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
It is written to him, transmitted through the pickup.
“He transports it to the city and here he sells 900 euros for a thing with two shops,” he says.
“The truth is, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a plan for the detection of crimes is on fire, they make a control purchase from the illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, in the blogs, until the comrade, who offered to come to the platform "Begova", where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner" where we will negotiate.
I only knew the price of the gun there.
Victor Baranets Military Surveyor
To get a gun I need an acquaintance who has a way out, - says the seller-consultant. - I have such a acquaintance, but I am not sure about him.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also have to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out".
I'm even getting a couple of castets right now through a person I'm sure of.
He delivers them to me too, because he knows I won't give them up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photos where there was "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there we set a target.
“I’m given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon beats well, we start to negotiate,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet take to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
You don’t need any documents or personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - writes in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
On it, users leave their requests and ask questions.
Will minors be sold?
"Without a license of course," the user asks "Ivan" (the spelling is saved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of fake sites and those wishing to buy a combat weapon scratches a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia
Military Observer and Former Military Victor Baranets
I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for Right to Arms.
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of fake sites and those wishing to buy a combat weapon scratches a shovel.
“People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can settle in the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to Weapons", Makarov's gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets are attacked
Because of the work at the box office, McDonald's passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one has been able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or whether it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages that ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems receive, the protestors’ goal is to create unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales crashed into America, capturing millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by slingshots.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and, together with unions and left-wing activists, picketed the stores of the corporation, whose goods are expected to be of modest and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paying Walmart employees only get paid at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods at a lower price in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as a shortage of forklifts or manual scanners.
Black Friday stockholders demanded a raise in wages and said the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
To a typical Walmart employee, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is not in his pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she’s spending on her salary right now.
If Walmart puts the increase in wages on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Proponents of Walmart quite note that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause the corporation any damage.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
A spokesman for the corporation, Dan Vogelman, told the Huffington Post in an interview that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just another “piar stunt” by the union.
It's a free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their object was not Walmart department stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn’t even give you hospitals or pay you for honest work!
Jumeirah Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their regular workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one in this expensive city earns less than them.
How you can live in New York for that kind of money is incomprehensible to me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald’s, who worked at their counters after school, living with their parents.
Few saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I’m constantly coming across interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal has a comment on the forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the area of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing union activists with slashings and firings.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But to cover the trade union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unusual flow of personnel.
Disagree
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day a rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which featured several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council, Jumaine Williams, who said: "McDonalds pays you not even for this.
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the protests, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must join forces to support fast-food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were workers of fast food, which in New York employs tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass movement.
"So far, cheating the brain turns out to be average"
The theme of augmented reality, popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft submitted an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company glasses - a stage passed.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Please tell me, in general terms, what is your research group doing?
“We’re dealing with human interaction with machines, but we’re trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes tickling in them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead of us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, a lot is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We’re trying to change that, we’re working on true three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but aren't they overestimating it?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about fancy gestures, but about such cumbersome, short gestures.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future is behind a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- What's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this can of soda?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will mostly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of clearance, depth or something?
- In principle, the current generation is something that we can draw from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get a megapixel 8 at a speed of 1000 ps.
But it is not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 bps is frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bettyshes of our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, but it does not require touch, so that the frames per second is larger.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
But now the third camera is, in fact, an ordinary sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem.
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in three-dimensional positioning.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking, holding the smartphone in your raised hands, is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transient" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and a dale
Glasses are a very personal device, that’s their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time the augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are the responses your team is preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great press recorder!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" touch - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is, it feels, but for now it is very weak - as if you are swollen on the cushions.
There are bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here lies another task that has to be fought for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - we are working on concepts of running paths (not the same as in clubs), moving platforms, and also huge
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher – many things are in an absolutely conceptional state.
Tasting instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “Petersburg avant-garde”, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, in the vanguard of culture and art.
In this top list have already fallen bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the eponymous artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, then at fashion parties and renaissances.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright person of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets evoking a smile from the citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently, he took the charm in his hands and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around town in all the red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image-maker and society.
Although in society everything that is almost not gray, causes aggression and arousal of a bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at getting the conversation started.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gassing that led to Pushkinskaya-10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me into theater, clothes, music, in all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to feel in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995 I occupied the territory at Pushkinskaya 10, and there, until there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jaz, I remember how String was brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
String and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a stretchy t-shirt, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs up to the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gryboedov - is echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and always left.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "People of our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was named me, ended my culmination.
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is recognizable.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an untimely category.
I used to be social, now to be like that is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is blurred, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian dressing in the order of order.
Now on the clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in his mouth.
And the deception will be removed with the help of disguise.
And recently, we saw you as a city charmer, and a cultural city must have a hero like that.
To whom, as not to me, they will be.
Is it possible that commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art should be neat, tactical, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people fought in rows, the bohemian loved one, the simple another.
Now everyone has broken into micro-communities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And to Stas Mikhailov comes a few thousand!
- There are broshenki coming, there the sex and social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything stinks.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what I have acquired.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that one collector hung them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually end.
Concepts are often confused now.
They say: a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a cultural person of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official from culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right kings everything was wrong, the kings may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow.
“We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they’re staggered, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
The taste buds are thriving now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's that for you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil.
Art is hard to grow on our stones.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, that’s wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg
Birth in Space
The land is in danger.
Global Warming or Collision with a Killer Asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board go in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same alternate planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or orbiting Venus... in space.
To approach the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the removal in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophile.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get at the exit of an absolutely normal chicken.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem that this chick has to find support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," - explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAS.
Unable to resist, the chickens swarmed uncontrollably.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, after four days, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "miniature" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with the fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was on biosatellites, but again - this is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats have offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female organism.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say: will it survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"No one has answered this question," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Watchtang Vachandze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, units there are cosmonauts, who after long flights everything went well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even with orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valeriy Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the CPC is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts work out their skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, water, albeit a comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for infants - a native element.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's body, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says nanny swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for a born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - it requires gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness tremble the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls the ability to push out the fetus.
All right, let's put this down, relying on the stimulants of childbearing.
You can, of course, go to a special room for childbirth, she will push him out.
"And what next?" - asks non-trivial questions Valeriy Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will be deprived of what he needs for life.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts Igor Pestov, the head of the Bioethics Committee of the RAS.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when the Earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Main Control and Audit Office: The check of the wrestling system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the site Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack,” Kala said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called wrestling system leads.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are entrusted with the duty to verify and achieve the fulfillment of the obligations,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
I mean a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, it is a matter of European legislation affirming how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished check, interesting differences have been found - simply put, the legislation we have may be "accurate and infallible", but in practice we are inferior to Germany on some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, the reduction and the improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the relevant thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be overflowing with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been lowered.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the law on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, acts as our CRU, there is also a college that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the federal level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for the local legislation, is it easier there than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said for certain that it is better at everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Certainly not, but I repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the sample countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, are the consequences in some way manifested?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we have started to use our new tool "detection of the risk of inconvenience", through which we have driven almost 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the passage of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens to the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "hardened" and it will be impossible to comply with them.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only put even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called wrestling system. What does this mean?
Is the "Schwarz-System" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of bodies that are required to verify and enforce their obligations.
You can say, “We’re going to change this law and solve it,” but you can’t say that we’re going to pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules as to how and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they pass, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region the roads were traversed, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
The temperature has fallen from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should warm up slightly.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information obtained from the regional road workers, it became known that there were places with lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and first-class roads in the region are currently run without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are passed.
But in some of their areas there are still remnants of frozen and places of snow.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located at the heights.
Pardubice and Kralovegrad Region
The Czech Highways and Highways Administration reports on its web pages that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are in danger of freezing, and on mountain roads and roads located in the highlands, there may be a layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about the ice, which can form especially in the heights of the Pardubice region.
The ice can be around Lanshcrown, Ust-up-on-Aurlitz, Policki, Svitavi or Vysoke Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located at Svitavi, are treated with chemicals.
Particularly snow lies on the roads of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlicki Mountains.
A layer of snow is found on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Richnova nad Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today variable clouds without precipitation.
Temperatures typically range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In some places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 now runs virtually unrestrictedly, however, road operators recommend being careful between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and defrosted surface.
Frozen areas can be found in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
The roads of the second and third class are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in relation to the possibility of the appearance of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on poorly used roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Krai
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region should take into account the snow porridge on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Kr<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xBE>.
At night, the snow forced road workers to take to the streets, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other areas of the road edge, as a rule, pass without restrictions.
"On the heights of Schumperka there are remnants of snow.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should take into account the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the Schumperk road management manager told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Esenik went to clear roads, they assured that the roads on the highlands after treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olmütz, the roads run without restrictions, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where moisture is still retained.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still some hard-to-pass places.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or fallen snow, a mountain road has been closed on the site from Telnica on the Clinic in Ustetsk region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of the holodeck in the vicinity of Shteti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day it was raining and snowing, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 route on the border of the Ustec and Liberec regions.
Due to the curved under the layer of snow branches of trees, touching the road, were forced to close the road in Telnica on the Knynica.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think the end of the world will come in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news stories that we humans get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced at 11:10 a.m. on December 21.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will start in parallel.
They will end, to put it bluntly, when the May calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time provide us with support.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancels".
Will the YouTube hymns already loved by listeners sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not come.
It will be sung by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words to this song written and played the role of Jesus in the video Thomas Ganak, also participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start collaborating with them?
We are also collaborating with other people of Czech cultural life as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will be the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the Edlichka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Edlicchi Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edlichka Institute, in the future there will be a separate building, into which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such “grand events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
“Next year we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, would love to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for abroad, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and toolboxes.
However, so far they handled it without problems. Czech airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the East it is still at the base level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here there is still a savage independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there are no such trivial things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we have to constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe forms of disability move on their own in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, or anywhere else.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but the moment famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything will really start to change.
So far these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap are now very popular, but let’s go back to two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and I also play on the saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has popularity only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, we were helped by the fact that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the band.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that imitate each other.
It is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all of the abandoned personalities that we should be sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I’m saying that if people with disabilities do something, it’s a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success ensured that you are a strict leader, as many consider you to be?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telepost at the time of the performance of the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancels".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 CZK, for children up to 12 years of age admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years took an active part in a number of ESA projects.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and space science.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned propagandist of space science, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway dredge, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to accelerate or brake the truck.
Information about this dress is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Armament Technology Section in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfka and Gustav Mokzicki.
From the materials preserved, it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric missile-fighter, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year came the work "Air missile-torpedo and aviation missile-bomb" by the author Lelya-Kjivoblotsky.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Prior to the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all the projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work was completed due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work, devoted to space science, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November issue of the journal "Problems", which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will engage in space science.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the fall POA became its actual member.
The following year, the first chairman of the International Astronautical Federation, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902-1959), became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested in the Bled desert.
This missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high-altitude wind.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor of the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1S - 0.62 l.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unrestrained financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of labor (wage) there is a price tension.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the state in which the producer, by means of the delivery of cheap goods, tries to withstand economic competition by "disrupting" the value of the competitor in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either relocate their production abroad, or buy cheaply abroad, or disappear. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor is high compared to others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it generates, the inevitable expenditure of the State on social needs is increasing.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they inflict in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual States when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own populations to private capital at will, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to the current legislation.
The aim is to make its people economically obey the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing the rights of workers in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time, the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
Within the framework of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases where employed people receive such wages that the state must pay them to obtain a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the EU’s southern states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to exist on a low-wage basis.
The question is, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to the point of nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy through managerial actions.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing politics and thus the whole state, is not operating for its own selfish purposes?
The unambiguous answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to the lack of funds, are in charge of the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are closely connected with the industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in his book The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long been disintegrating, and the ministries are engaged in violence.
Snatches, illegal obtaining of graces with the help of stones and swords.
It will be necessary for the people to go to elections with a pre-sold vote"...Ordinary people did not run for the post of ruler at all, after all, one day the state remained without a consul for eight months.
As in antiquity, in modern society, one’s own reckless interests predominate without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes we must look for in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next tour is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at the international, national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the shareholding of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing comes out of violence, and it can never come out” – Sting, the song “Brilliant”, where the main verse of the refrain is the words: “don’t forget how fragile we are”.
“If my sons hadn’t wanted war, they wouldn’t have been.” – Gutel Schnapper, wife of Meyer Amschel Rothschild
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, prompted many responses.
Some advocate Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role.
I do not want to think about who, in these periodically recurring waves of murders, is a criminal, and who is the victim, after all, of today's citizens of Israel, including self-governed territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the onset of violence.
My aim is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at what has been the main source of the 95-year-old tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their steps completely independently, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It must be admitted that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power flowing from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of a single generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be seen as the head of a stud (I don’t know if anyone stands above them, but that’s not excluded) – Rothschild.
Not much is written about them.
Of course you do.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought back in the 90s of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the higher realms in which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have large packages of shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, there were only four countries).
Anyone who tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great 33rd level Freemason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to provide their comfort and luxury), and they will not need much.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed’s justification, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by initiating the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was disintegrated.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge military reparations, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only for the Germans to throw a strong enough, blaming the guilty and offering simple solutions.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state as a world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the focal point of the war a third.
If the international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of hostilities on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is to blame in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers encourage people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is not only a hawk of Netanya, but also a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, a politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), is a hawk of the world.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their conception is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
And it causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that anyone who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name may not be able to buy or sell.
This is what wisdom is: Anyone who has intelligence can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to a man's name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo: When There's Nothing Worse, Call Hollywood"
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, a positive outcome was not expected - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, “Operation Argo” describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult tours, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, aided by an extravagant cover legend that they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew searching the country for a place to shoot a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, arranged press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "movie-movie", the story of a successful venture, an affair - an example can be a number of films about friends of Owen.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - the men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck was able to re-start his career.
From a mocking actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film by Affleck that is not made in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that exalted the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when the story suddenly changes somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the fictional scenes (fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this little, sometimes something thinks - there it all comes out not so elegant (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the imminent crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the chase on the runway look pretty naughty).
The disadvantage of Argo is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of drama, it’s a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro style recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in the known sense of living history, as well as to testify to the exaggeration of the notions of omnipotent and omniscient special services.
The rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
“We were moved to this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies, they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU’s controversial provisions include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a cell for chickens.
Critics also criticized the factual ban on the use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of a veto defends the claims of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show an "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the Commission justified itself by harmonizing only the existing divergent national rules that made trade difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has still softened standards on fruits and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
Last year’s EU regulation that balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision could also be a candidate for the prize in the poll.
The EU has turned to American studies, according to which balloons while playing are a potential cause of death of children through choking.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are forbidden to blow in fair-flying dolls.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: anyone holding any official office in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic to Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but must instead say "BURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for the vote, in addition to several absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
“We are in a disadvantage because we do not have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said Yaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture (CSDP), in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles of stocks that had to be removed.
The fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Subsidies were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemce (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the drawing up of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are the exception
While the decisions in the Member States are easily criticised, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is drawing on EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, as in other countries of the European Union, must fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheese", however, "Tuzemsky rum", the tradition of which in our country has its roots in the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous “feta” and “gorgonzola” cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, have already been found, for example, Karlovy Vary, Pogorzelice and Tr<0xC5><0xA1>ebon carp and <0xC5><0xBE>atecki.
Also the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubice pastry and Gorzhitzki tubes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how does a man think about running for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country break up in the last 20 years, thieves roam here, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and an independent person who doesn’t belong to any party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You were in the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential palace.
Are you not turning your back on the people who chose you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can realize my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that, as a nation, we are groaning at our own bar or at the TV, but at the same time we are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media that blacken a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irji Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with the thesis on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the reverse property declarations amounting to more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You do not have such powers as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied to make excursions a free enterprise, I managed to promote it.
The problem is in politics – when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately put in the way, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, unbiased person, I have much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country, and apply it, without distributing the party on the shelves, without looking at the dogma.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, I think people treat me more like a leftist.
It doesn’t matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about someone being on the right, it’s about someone being on the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it will be offered by the HRM or the DPR, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you have said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or are being talked about by eminent experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will have only slogans.
You won’t last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong person who will voice abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to uphold my beliefs and views.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to push things forward on my own; if that doesn’t happen, I’ll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
This part of it sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I’ve passed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who exposed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate so that changes will be made with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the cleanliness of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You’re talking about property declarations, and how are your own dealings with it?
Personal property is valued at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston-Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, well, and a few million more in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against ugliness and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, you own $60 million worth of property and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to put your own money into it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for a campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are essentially covered by the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for an English school that's worth 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So, you will continue to do business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it?
But it does not depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be the silverless man who will keep the republic.
But I have to live for something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to receiving monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
And if I were president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Law".
The architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikeniss and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verhaig, passing by the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large company located nearby, says: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
No one wants to go to these old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spaekenisse, an unremarkable dormitory town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas of the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, addressed the challenge with his usual indiscretion and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his mouse and ear.
And while the jury members scrutinized and shrugged their shoulders, the daring Maas put together a pyramid from his original gift in size and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Speikeniss, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Competition for Wooden Structures.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which before could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy factory, became richer in one modern work of architecture.
But the most important thing is that in Spaykenis, the first public building of cultural purpose appeared in the history of this city.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
There is only one lift in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The glazed room on all sides is bright and easily visible, the floors of the burnt brick and the elegant street lights unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The gaze involuntarily looks for benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vinny Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from head to toe and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the mountain of books has been skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical premises.
Particularly pleased are the black book shelves, which serve as decoration of the walls, parapets, staircase railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even skilled architects and construction engineers get lost in guessing what kind of unknown material it is.
“We sought to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in line with the standard’s requirements.
And once at a farm in Friesland we found a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a lining for the roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve for one or two seasons, after which it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplasty (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little like sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Those who overcome the almost 500-metre-long path will be rewarded in the literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wooden ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass hood, even on clear days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Wide glued-wood farms located perpendicular to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, a skeptic from the field of IT mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verheugen was also already here.
Cynthia Bogard, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, called Buckenberg “the soul of Speikeniss, who had long been lacking.”
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to occupy empty shelves in a library not yet fully staffed - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
Shelves are forced up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winnie Maas.
“I think thanks to our invitation, every resident is now somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Spaykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
“The Germans must play a more important role.”
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
- Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think she supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in a vote to impose a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was governed by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a common policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that for the time being they are only looking at their role, but they are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Britain pursues.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests differ greatly from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t attach too much importance to it, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a headline as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the contrary, has clearly expressed its veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of U.S. domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would have been a little easier for the Germans if there had been a unified, uncontradictory European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That’s how they deal with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been tricky.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won’t it really take on the lead role?
Or is the leading role still difficult to give to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans can’t just handle it.
In fact, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to take into account a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant or it increases your dislike of you – that’s life!

China’s ‘Trademark Protection’: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is one of them.
What is Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
It is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to defend their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a company that specializes in trademark infringements in the Far East.
On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind.
Imitators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringement of intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are not the same. At the behest of his trustees, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere, by the trademark registration office.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
“It hurts business, we need to fight it,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is fading, the unique position is being lost, the image is suffering greatly.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious entries in the trade mark register, and it is costly.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo company that bought Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with the famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The Trademark Registration Office of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of personnel and equipment.
But last year there was a “return from the emergency in the work process to normal.”
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases for objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the ministry said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To put it simply, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to protest, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to bring about that the illegal production of fake car parts by them was eliminated.
The imitator, however, secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was its own omission, as surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the Trademark Registration Office CTMO rejected the Munich-based claim.
It is true that Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until now.
You need to be vigilant
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs are hardly accountable, the firm's archive had to review even the acts of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “large six-figure euro sum” for settlement.
“It’s clear how much it costs us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
“You have to be vigilant,” says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend German businesses to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should "everything that is somehow worth protecting, also register in China," says Ventsler.
Otherwise, it can cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: Kicking, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing – and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
A history of relations that have covered a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
At first, the drowning is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only after that the voices of the singers slowly grow - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come forward, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his matte shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty choir members from 23 to 69 years old, from a specialist in human genetics to a bartender, came to the rehearsal.
"Om Obani" is not an easy thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, in addition to a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Essiteni, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 per month, you can take over the leadership.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means narrator or admirer.
In this room, they don't speak fluently on a bantu, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this soft language and occasionally even bringing them back to where they first appeared: to southern Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers in the summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esslingen, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty Percent Infected
There are about 2000 people living there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus.
The miniature of Essigeni reflects the disease of all of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later the choir founded the association “Voices for Africa”, which has since almost professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Essen.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What Are the Most Important Sexually Transmitted Diseases?
Bacterial PPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral IPPs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pediculosis and scabies belong to parasitic IUPs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
We also often have human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were about 2,700 cases in 2011.
That’s about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, there may be ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, in part, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular examination, especially in the event of frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most IPPs and avoid long-term consequences.
The leadership, donations and not least the fees for choir performances throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Essen,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that the orphans are well-organized, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu old women call it, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in shape appear every day in time for classes.
Those who do not have relatives go to the shelter to Hani Sil, a single woman receiving a salary from the association, as well as two poachers, who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized an HIV test for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious all over the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies on the roving workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a bit of cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black - such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Essigény, where the singers visit the children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Eculveni river it is more than famous.
“Go to Essigeni, there’s light,” the locals say.
And after the 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the melting singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
Previous Post:NASA Opens Ice on Mercury
The Messanger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messanger probe has found evidence that the planet's permanently shadowed region is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Inconspicuously for Earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small windows in infinite dales.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope presents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the stellar circle.
This star-forming region - scientists unromanticly call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This warm-up of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A doughnut-like ring consists of a material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic birth room.
The star cluster of the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, color works better.
How the red eye blinks at the viewer's snail nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continent has given this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography ensures expressive color transmission.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It may be the fragments of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the Milky Way galaxy
Depending on the color distribution, images of spiral galaxies are turned into real works of art.
A picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (triangular, three-part), since the dark strips of dust divide the hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of Snake Bearer, astronomers have photographed a forerunner of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the two merging galaxies are moving toward each other and inevitably collide.
This birth of the Hubble star was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical reductions can call it by the nickname "Southern Pipe Wheel".
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 has been photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgee - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the space available to them is deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a gigantic internal device - the diameter of only one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Big South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for cost reduction.
However, in diameter, it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly attached at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobbit-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-collecting capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very Large Telescope" - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The European Very Large Telescope is also planned to be installed at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should be spread over a total of 42 meters - and will be made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks up at the sky using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can see the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the "Messenger" rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messanger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink oil every day and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with the thunder rides along a winding road past the thick forests of hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think of it as being in the Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live talyshi - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, of which little is known, except that they speak perfectly in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by their longevity.
The final point is Leric.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet arrived.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerika.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented a biography of about eight dozen carvings of these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the chaban Shirali Muslimov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, are not.
And given that the eldest, whose age was confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Moslem chaban add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about long-term residents in Central Asia.
“Remarkably many older people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, it is not possible to scientifically confirm the age because there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of boiled oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerica are strikingly often Bible-aged.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special genes of the talus.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about food.
Plates love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoeva lives in Chengdu, a tiny village near the city of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have already had their grandchildren for a long time.
There will also be two kids nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical scrambled glasses of armud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark-brown hairs, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
“And I never used shampoo,” Mirzaeva says.
The monthly pension is enough for life.
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in a store in my life.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after World War II.
But it was better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev got behind the wheel.
Propaganda doesn’t often sound like an old woman’s speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among the elderly of Azerbaijan.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “The elderly in our culture are deeply respected.”
They live in a big family, loved, cared for and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the country’s deep division.
The future Sharia-based constitution has met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president did not squander on pafos.
We need to create a transition.
"And its success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and expanded his jurisdiction to “save the revolution.”
However, what a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged into a night-time 15-hour jump with obstacles at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on the “principles of Islamic law.”
What do you mean by “principles”?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal air for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least, this is indicated by one new article: in all matters relating to Shariah, the Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be included in the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court must remain.
These courts under Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians in the military prison.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state should protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morality and values".
Legally, this is so vaguely formulated that state institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature with the help of this article.
With open text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were not to be blamed.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable to say that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Will there be enough cartoons about the president or jokes about the judiciary?
The issue of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Mursi proposes to sign and which he says will be presented to the Egyptians "very soon" for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, an opposition has been formed against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammad El-Baradei, said the draft constitution had a place “in the dump of history”.
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to lead a “putch against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges have also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and followers of the Salafists, who shouted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They demanded of Morsi, “Clean up the country!” and assured him, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Mostly for the Islamist project, this is considered a settled matter.
The concept of “human rights” is never mentioned.
Hafiz Abu Saeed is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” never appear in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with “Welt am Sonntag”.
The expansion of Morsi’s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto cancelled it," Saeda said.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeed feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be retribution for this.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns, “You are creating a monster you can’t control.”
Norwegian raccoon: the worst smelling fish in the world?
With a population of five million, Norway has one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also around the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country’s success is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely evil fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will have a smelly smell of raccoons - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours drive from Oslo.
Surrounded by snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air will pour an indestructible characteristic smell.
A rakfish is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandering in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of shower you need to achieve.
As the twilight thickens and cools, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
“It is eaten raw and washed with a sip of aquavit, local mint vodka,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-ordinated by the “Racphysic General”, who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and wash it in large portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavits more than raccoons,” says Howard.
This drink is able to break the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - little different from the portion of land that you drove with you on the bus for a long time.
The rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, the fish was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the autumn.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish has already well and thoroughly fertilized, it was extracted and, suppressing the perception of alcohol, eaten.
In the memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are drawn here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and a much more profitable neighbor) come to work here massively.
The rift is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat grim, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the country’s residents seem to be satisfied with it.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the July 22nd".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of today’s well-being of Norway lies the growth (since the 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“Oil, however, is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who carries trays of ragged raccoons, a woman with long, light hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people – as you call it – intelligent.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English very well.
We don't like to show up, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandering money that they didn’t have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a raccoon," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - the raccoon is enough for me.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening we will have even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to raccoons, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV show, in which they show the leader in a tie-butterfly, surrounded by plates with raccoons.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what rating did you put for the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from the chair, possibly by crossing the aquavit.
Or maybe just by inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto is facing a difficult start to his career.
As Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly bad state.
This city is overcrowded with transport and at the best time, and since Monday, steel fences have been erected, cutting through several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will wear a presidential tie and take over the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who is now in office, but the country has plunged into a war on drugs, which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the oval office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, next to the President of the United States, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s political career developed as the governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and expansive state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight-line human
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents are credited with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with bumps and pits that were previously on this site.
The signs with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are linking hopes with him for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence at the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has placed high hopes on Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
He also denies the accusations of incontinence brought against the new president by the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people have a different idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Nessaualcoitl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the escalators of the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of a harsh nature of this metropolis.
Troops were deployed earlier this year to pacify drug gangs in these areas, and violence against women is particularly acute.
Dozens of dead women have been found in a desert near a large landfill in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorate of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto - a figure well above that in the infamous city of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, whose name has become defamatory when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to his opponents, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, at best, could be said to have failed to deal with the problem of the murder of women during his tenure as governor.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of ignoring the problem completely.
An inhabitant of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this slum area, Irenaeus Buendia hardly holds back tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her cohabitant.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before that,” recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already swollen.
Mariana’s mother tells the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which is written only one word: justice.
This, they said, is what this family was denied.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled disturber of peace.
They want people to just accept everything they say and shut up.
But this is wrong, it is not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
Putting on a presidential tie on Saturday, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by crimes related to violence, and the new president has promised to make solving this problem a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor,” Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo’s PRI party, said.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the indictment states.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims about poor conditions in detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's terms of detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the indictment tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had to transfer while in military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that records of Manning's weekly visits by prison administration officials for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, were not available.
A cross-examination of the defence's request to terminate Manning's case on the grounds that the terms of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was carried out the next day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst who was arrested in June 2010 has been charged with stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, prosecutor Feyn, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filled in after Manning's visits by administration officials during his stay in Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he assessed the prison administration’s treatment of him as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reports in question do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Feyn argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that his visiting administration representatives had discussed these problems with him and had stated that they would deal with them, but had not recorded them in writing.
“They were recording ‘no issues’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise this topic in the conversation,” Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he hadn’t complained about the mistreatment of him in January 2011 during a commission meeting that looked at the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to have the “trauma prevention” regime removed and the conditions of detention eased.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that a limited detention regime - at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay with them canceling the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living would improve, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to the severe heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your destiny is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to the size of my prison at Camp Africa," Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day — alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, hats, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the day was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in his eyes, he was constantly struck by a light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in bed at night, then, according to him, he was awakened and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made while testifying on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates on the morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Answering the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket to cover himself, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use rubber panties or flip flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, hats and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he has had to endure during his detention, and significantly shorten his prison term if Manning is found guilty by a military court that is due to begin examining his case early next year.
The defense said it planned to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest regime.
The charges against Manning include accomplices to the enemy, illegal promotion of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the theft of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexicans of American origin are rift between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control area and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos, the other for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called a Mexican my whole life.
It’s just a conditional name, like how my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex construction of "American of Mexican descent".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That’s why I got my American passport and became in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were issues familiar to the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a heavy and old-fashioned matter.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the guise of a rifle forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only worth it for any U.S. statesman to silence even a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society, complaints are immediately distributed that Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with militancy.
Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
Do you want to talk about insults?
They're enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone—a father or a grandfather—had no opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often it was Mexicans of a certain type - dim, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we have studied in good schools and settled for good jobs, but let us not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second class people, as unreal Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican descent.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances, Americans of Mexican descent, do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I have found out during my trip, as if our relationship is already not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don’t think this country is so beautiful at all.
I'm sorry, but deal with this yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still offended by the way they have treated their relatives in Mexico recently.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East possible?
The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
It sounds like the usual, meaningless arguments about who started first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time during the conflict, the city's missiles fired from the Gaza Strip's territory were dropped into the vicinity.
However, despite the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in their perennial conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have surrounded many established realities in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not managed to stay away from the swirl that has shaken the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without victors
At first glance, the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, say they have forced Israel to retreat despite the losses it suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been wiped out and 1.7 million people have been stranded in one of the most densely populated and troubled places on the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
The resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing countries in the Persian Gulf.
Celebrating Hamas supporters declare the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by a paramilitary group of Hezbollah, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow the power of the Hashemite coalition where the Ughis of Bashar al-Assad, and Dahles.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where, under President Mohammed Morsi, the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic deployments, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the launched Hamas missiles.
Citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully for at least some time.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained true to its unchanging position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the last round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel’s economic prosperity, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis have died from missiles fired from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of terrorist-killers, partly due to the wall that enters the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan - a significant part is not accepted.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of impersonating the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If all the power in the West Bank is given to them, will they not start launching rockets into Israel from there, as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
It is possible that the supporters of the "hard" line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense portion of Israel’s budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt’s president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change in Arab countries comes along, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a slow-motion bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - is only exacerbating these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay for the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
There remains the only solution that is constantly being called upon by sensible representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel’s concession of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long taken the decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more favourable position than ever before in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967 in view of the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote at the UN, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama must also play a role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continues to show a reluctance to engage in the solution of the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the image of disease-affected parts of the body are contrasted on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in world practice, the Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of dull olive color with scary pictures of their parents who are affected by the disease of the parts of the body and images of children.
In addition to various pictures and inscriptions warning about the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages introduced in mandatory order from this Saturday - the names of the brands, which are printed in the same fine print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“Obviously, even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging design,” Health Minister Tanya Plibersek explains, citing research that has shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering taking such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigar holders and silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging has increased rapidly (almost from zero) since two months ago, such companies as the British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco and the Tobacco
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesale companies and is expecting a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
The potential impediment to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After Australia passed a number of laws that made it illegal to advertise cigarettes on television and support sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the case of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret his strength and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry even went to such measures as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has not been unfairly restricted by Australia, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries are not subject to unfair restrictions.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory placement of photos warning of the harm of smoking.
This rule is now accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disobeying innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and hide a packet in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the packet.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on shelves.
“Before I had an hour to unload a new batch, and now I have four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it’s over, we close the store,” he says, putting his hands up.
Missing in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane that we had been waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to fool you.
Half a day at the airport while waiting for a flight is really boring, and there will not be much help neither books, magazines, iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
However, more and more scientists and specialists in children's development have recently expressed themselves in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and our children to miss.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Do we need to be bored?
Oh, yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
In the past, I, like many, believed that boredom was an invention relative to recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tuy, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book “A fascinating history of boredom” (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, assistant professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on the subject and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but can’t do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something he’d like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in experiencing boredom, he says, is "a disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is stretching slowly."
The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when we’re really just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study, “Unemployed Mind: Defining Boredom from a Point of View,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previous experiment, whose participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an off-the-shelf television program included in a neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume, so they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the voice recording without a foreign soundtrack.
Those who listened to low-volume television noted that they were bored, more often than others — they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interruption can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed that when people start swinging on a chair or drawing caracula on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study found that children who are not forbidden to snore and turn around learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point we all feel bored: with a flight delay (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show a different degree of propensity for boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “boring propensity scale” to measure such individual characteristics.
Questions and statements such as "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous" or "I'm interested in too much, so I don't have time for anything" are used to determine the rating on this scale.
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers often miss out.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents 7-8 times a day with the help of a pager.
He received the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescence has a peak of a tendency to boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: Is boredom helpful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, as research shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
“So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that’s boredom,” says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do.
If you get bored and you direct that energy to playing the guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll do yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses you and you give him an iPad, he will no longer miss you, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and work, says Professor Fenske.
"And such skills of self-regulation are used in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think that boredom should be exalted somehow.
However, it is also not worth considering it as a bad thing.
It is better to learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see this as having to be bored more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant overstimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and student of a public college in southeastern Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offense that will soon be completely legal throughout the state: storing a small portion of her marijuana and tubes.
Mr. Orosco says that one day in September, he was in Lamar with his friends and drove in a car along the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for drug storage and possession of a drug-using device - a small offense, for each of which a fine of $100 - and a date for the trial was set.
“They treat us like criminals,” says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small lawsuits depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Charges of minor marijuana-related offenses have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar action.
Police have already stopped bringing charges against people 21 years of age and older for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana-related cases and continue to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they are voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s all going so fast that I don’t even know what to expect,” says Daniel J. Outs, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the governing bodies in Washington state also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They have to establish rules to determine the licensing procedure for growing, processing, distributing and selling marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“There’s a more orderly market in Colorado, so they’ll serve as a good example,” said Brian I. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Board of Alcohol Production and Sales.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The bill, dubbed I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and put the state in a state of uncertainty for a whole year when the state licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
And there are still some difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to find a balance between the state's provision for "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on trading it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana companies in a range of cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly-established Center for Marijuana Legalization research group.
On November 21, the Chief of Police Outs of Aurora sent a message to his subordinates by e-mail that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold people 21 years of age responsible for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police are no longer counting people in this violation.
Police chief Outs said police will monitor the city’s compliance with the rules governing the activities of medical marijuana growers and will prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Attorney General of Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is presenting a stricter approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office would continue to hold marijuana accountable, mainly to encourage its users to undergo a course of treatment.
At the moment, 119 people have been charged with holding two ounces or less of marijuana, although many are also charged with other violations.
“It is our institution’s duty to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults responsible for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hutzinger backed the decision, but also decided not to drop charges on already-opened marijuana storage cases.
“I believe that it is our direct duty to ensure that the law is upheld until it is changed,” he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier to this issue,” explains Sean Macalister, a Denver attorney representing the interests of marijuana convicts, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve been persecuting people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington, D.C. — the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana the same as alcohol — are destined to become an experimental field on the scale of the country to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope that the Office of Justice will give in on this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of merchants and medical marijuana-using patients, the federal government has in most cases approved the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Drug Control are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores, which are allowed under the new law to deal with drug dealers, according to Kevin A. Sabet.
Some cities in Colorado have not waited for the action of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, which would not have been able to open sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in such a position that we’re going to give someone a license, and then it’s going to cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
The city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium that laid the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the history faculty of Worcester College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I packed up my suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and he cried.
My friends were out of their minds.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in a neighboring room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from shattered cups.
Actually, it wasn't all that fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or what I was studying in a private school.
I was plagued for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now-deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why should I mention it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, who adhere to center-right views, is subjected to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Corps Christi College student club in Cambridge say they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary on student politics "The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were introduced by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Association of Conservatives, who rides a rolls-raise, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver cane.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making "goats of forgiveness because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "the university environment is becoming increasingly distorted to the left.
People who don’t even know us think of us as rude and unpunished children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the historic faculty of the Corpus Christi College, in which a request was made to strengthen the protection, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, a new president of the Law Center of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Oxford, says that the relationship between the members of the club is more student.
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply the normal life of the club members,” she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford had a fever of hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was ahead of them.
I did not yet know that the teachers not only looked through the fingers at the poisoning of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues - the strike of miners, privatization and the government's disagreement to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through the wooden walls of the audience.
In my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
“Mrs. White,” said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text gave me a hard time, I got stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very bile-like person with a cake-like face.
“Doesn’t Tatcherists teach French in principle, or do they just lack the brains?” he asked.
The other students sneered.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take some initial French lessons in your spare time if you’re certainly not too busy spinning around in society,” Pitt said.
I came back to my room completely unfortunate.
That night in college, I was sitting alone for lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English, who introduced himself as a member of the University’s Association of Conservatives.
“I know who you are,” he said politely.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone suspected of having sympathy for the Conservatives will be teased.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be Labour.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardlyly tried to hypocrite.
I've insisted that I don't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman from the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who studied at Eton himself said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up on his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
- They're beating each other up, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a labourer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn’t hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of her keynote speakers.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettyness, and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political views were adopted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said grievingly.
- There's no way to do that, except in a city of sleeping squirrels...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.”
His wet eyes murmured.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not withstand the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame in my soul, I confessed that “my parents had brainwashed me” and called them “old fools.”
The breath was short.
The last nail in the lid of the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to strike my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a plaster and a rag.
But at eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
What is even more sad is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which they value equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abbascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemicza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "or the Signore" of the Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of personal letters and photographs signed by the most eminent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Mary Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social uplift: from the humble tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“They don’t at least extinguish the smoke of their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemicz.
In the '60s and '70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incomparable host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains his ex-wife Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests Valentino made feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model” whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Fashion Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of genealogists
The life of the Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringings and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Somerset-House is a plaque is a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor occupies the place of models and must defile on the podium, contemplating the "viewers" of the dances, which are gleaming masterpieces of Valentino, such as a dress
In this audience of models shine such names as Sibilla Luxemburg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abbascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember him well.
These were trousers, shirt, "vest" and jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abbascal, one of the designer’s muse.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Duchess of Fairy.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “fit” to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
It was finally the end of the 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it to a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, a "corsage" in the fold and a neckline without straps.
“It was a dream that came true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the designer with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that accompany him".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls their seams) to make this outfit from ivory silk with an inlay of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a four and a half meter loop.
According to journalist Suzy Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the era of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the higher world".
Overwhelmed by the elite’s “lifestyle” for many years, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
The Knight of the Grand Cross (a mark of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a festive dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was impeccable, time does not exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The World's Toughest Occupation: Miners from Kavah-Igen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur on the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living from mining sulfur in the Kawah-Igen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with air.
He cuts out huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up the steep stone road.
To the summit of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but the exhausted loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb the tortoise step, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully paving the road so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened with a tourist from France who crashed a few years ago from the cliffs of Kavah-Igen.
Miners from Kavah-Igen earn 5 eurocents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract
Upon reaching the top, they pave the way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, who it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) to petrochemicals, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“Since the norm is a carry-over of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carry-overs.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems like a misery to such inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would have earned in the field.
“The fee paid to miners is very high by local standards, where for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the trucker, who previously worked as a stonemason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as the sulphur: "I got married to a girl from Baly.
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, constantly coughs, and his eyes will tear due to toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kavah-Igen, whose sulfur has already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he constantly coughs, and his eyes will tear because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tour guide, waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he does the mule work.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 carriers drag baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for a photo shoot, which, along with a 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) entrance ticket, guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-mules.
“This is work for cattle, not people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root carrier who has spent three decades in Kavah-Igen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he says he will endure the job “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so durable that no one complains about their severe diseases of the cortex... more serious and bulging, obviously, than their usual problems.
By balancing the basket on his back, Uninik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here, because the volcano is my whole life,” Unajnik says, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Igen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civil duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint pie advertising, but despite this – or possibly because of it – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like “Let’s put the bao (bulk) in the stove” to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their “national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was the topic that we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, such as launching spirits with pheromones or organising quick-dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?
1.2 children.
Who does not take it so lightly, it is the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity and maternity leave, and provides tax benefits.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Department of Policy on Spouses and Families at the National Population Office, said the reason was “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities”.
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at sharply increasing immigration to counter the population reduction, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where the scarcely-hidden xenophobia of many new immigrants, especially Chinese, is thriving, criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party got the worst result in elections since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so little housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The city’s development manual went on to control the number of small apartments known as the “shoebox” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a solitary lifestyle and deprive the incentives of developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their “shoe boxes” are sold much faster than the more spacious ones.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash income increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously challenged if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively tense
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the centre’s financial district, it seems they won’t have much effect.
“People are very over-stressed, housing is expensive, as is education, and that’s why many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, in terms of childbirth, the last word remains with the Singaporeans.
Personal in the offline - personal in the online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is a property of private or "the sphere of personal life, which they have the right to protect from any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations on the Internet that he would not share outside the Internet?
elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five guys from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” in the personal plane, and “password and username,” when applied to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t have uploaded to the post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I am also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who is behaving stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post indecent photos of nude people, crimes or write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I took Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re responding to me, I’m just loading them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends more quickly,” he points out.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never have accepted a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone to recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and the latter admits that he doesn’t know 20 people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one rubbed his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If I get pressured or demanded, I’ll just delete them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
“He didn’t know who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned on the privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key Issues <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>elos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she said.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prenski, a master of pedagogy from Yale University and the author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginal people are they, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning ourselves,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published, or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough for it.”
“Also that they are elective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and teenagers is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do this is pointless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you posted like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online in the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons for talking to children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,” he says.
According to Gaurdi, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR Summit ends without promulgation of the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
EFE has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published by the Government on the Peré website.
Asked about the text, they pointed out that the content was set out by the President of Peru, Oli<0xC3><0xA1>n Umal, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day only a video of the presidential assembly without a sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "closed session, sound is prohibited".
A small amount of information circulated among reporters was shared by the press secretaries of some Governments of UNASUR who attended the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement by Umala, and not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the press’ insistence, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not widely circulated.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to provide broadcasting systems for all journalists, but have limited access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict by the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olivia Umala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they will comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague hearing statements by both parties, as part of the indictment that Lima has filed against Santiago.
"We will abide by and enforce the decision that will clarify the differences that we are presently presenting to this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and welcomed the shaking of Umala’s hand against the background of the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia protested this week against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact, according to which it acknowledged submission to the verdicts of that international court after the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it deemed erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNESCO has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The incoming president, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon at Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 actions were approved among South American countries, the amount of the planned investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence".
He said action was being taken to “improve cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, cheap internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters.”
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru and are limited by transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbors, was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before taking part in the regional meeting, that he hopes to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold negotiations in a respectful manner on the international maritime dispute as a result of the verdi.
“After tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the question of citizenship integration": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and in other clashes, “but now they are practically one homeland.”
He defended, in this context, the project for the establishment of South American citizenship, which was endorsed by the participating countries of UNASUR.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers throughout any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also expressed his support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that the signatories of the San Jose Pact on Human Rights be taken into account.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, hinting at the political asylum Ecuador gave to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to arrive on its territory to interrogate an alleged sexual offence, while "only Swedish law considers it possible to carry it out through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What really exists is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem provided to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of inviolability, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judiciary.
We are not negotiating human rights, that is the word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is leading a number of trials in various European instances,” he said.
“If the UK provides a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogate Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to express himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediumity, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression."
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this respect, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries, were ruling Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, he would “deepen the revolution in order to continue the development in the right direction.”
Correa also backed the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto of UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups under the guise of legitimacy,” because in reality “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian president also said it was “fully justified” that his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos now wanted to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of the Nicaraguan suzerainty.
At the moment, this decision is not being respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to treat them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries undertake to take a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of running for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he indicated that he is considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa has assured that if he loses in the February 2013 election, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations like Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to acknowledge this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean worsening President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s health,” he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador attended today in Lima the VI Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS Mortality Today is the Result of Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his analysis of AIDS had yielded a positive result.
"I feel deafened," he recalls the difficult moment, despite the doctor's full pace.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabr<0xC3><0xAD>cio is one of the “oldest” patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he reached in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s it would be hard to believe - there were too few treatment options then, too little was known about the disease, too biased towards patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS was a sentence at the time.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, “cleared” their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," - said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Jaime Andrade, Solvay.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system, which is available in patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, the life of the patient, with the best expectation for the future.
Simply put, the above means that anyone who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national AIDS database have died.
255 people died in Halisco alone in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May this year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they are not aware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited the overwhelming data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who are on demand.”
In his proposal, the specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Khalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that he was a friend of the company and, despite his young age, he was already
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"I'm going to die anyway, I'd better fuck three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medications.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," - said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to promote the struggle of all those who are now in the context
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them find out that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms at the counter
There is a big gap between health care programs and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has dealt with the problem of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do they matter to you?" is a popular question, with hesitation and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not only behind the counters and that hundreds of them be in vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This is not an encouragement to looseness.
It is not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied when asked if it is possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Key Data in Khalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections relate to the sexual route, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for one registered case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that quashes the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a precedent for any domestic company with branches in a neighboring country that has trouble paying.
It appears that the procedures in support of the survival of firms that are allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country strips and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of Judge Harlin Hale’s decision in the Northern Texas District Bankruptcy Court on June 15 leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the door to the leading glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings relate to competitive proceedings being heard in Mexico.
The first paragraph entails the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Second, the verdict states that without an inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of the competitive debts that the Vitro subsidiary had before the parent company, the majority needed to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the branches, in one way or another Vitro’s creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely the funds of “peanuts” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeals is dropping this data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, hit by the serious economic crisis that the United States has overtaken by striking the country.
So far, the Gonzales Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the appellate court itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be made which will require a review of the process by the Supreme Court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competitive Procedures Act, signaling that he is exempting himself from the observance of the agreements signed by the U.S. Bank of America to become associated with it.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., rules established for insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambole from two sides: they hit the Vitro and hit the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The passionate basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector “Hetin” Reyes.
After all, before a brain hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-scale player, a senior basketball league player, an authorized and head of the BSN with Cowboys Bayamone.
“I’ve played a lot of basketball roles throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team, and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalls during Primera Hora’s visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives more than 50 years with Isabel, his fiancée.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorial items collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's BSN debut.
From that moment onwards, Kuko Ortis, who was a great administrator, was in charge," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartow, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Would you like?"
And that was the beginning of Minsy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsy had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minsy in the national team.
I remember how we won the U.S. for the first time during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got a fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team at the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and beat the U.S. national team, which was pretty much like the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
The team not only played again Minci, Gauss, Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculina' (Ortis), but also the young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales in the 90's.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of staff, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team at the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-playing players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicia and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for the mess at the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And that’s without taking into account his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s in BSN there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponse play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's superfluous.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his leading role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a businessman without principles, evil and mania.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon Jay Ar Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night from complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas-based production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her representative Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original personality and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained notoriety on television due to his role as a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters surrounded by it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a buzz around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked at bookmakers' offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in an episode from November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and made Dallas the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the 1983 finale of MASH, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), placed on treatment.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatrical stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the English Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or affecting them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and after,” he said.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "The End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people took as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charme had no idea what was waiting for him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "longarmageddon," and the growing conflict that drags Israel, a place where Christian end-time theorists believe Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor to offer “end of the world” courses this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Tempe, Associate Professor Barry Walker reads the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way they suggest hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what is probably plausible and impossible," Walker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students must learn, prepare projects and pass final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“Places ended in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was attended by 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, to Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vecks, a 25-year-old student in the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach that,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed—not to mention the professor—did say they believed in the end of the world date on December 21.
“Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it,” said Julie Seeglen, a 21-year-old senior fellow at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which is numbered several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows of any course on the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at a higher court order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there had been talk of many days of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some of my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the communications department.
