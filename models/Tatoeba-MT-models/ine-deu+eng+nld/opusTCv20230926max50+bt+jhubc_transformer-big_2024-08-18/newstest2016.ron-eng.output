UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “made this situation unresolved.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump out of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump is leading by a percentage of two figures and some voices are starting to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of being named.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race to nominate Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry’s advance made way for Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would struggle hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Below we present some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something transitory:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthused” or “grateful” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “displeased” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiasted” versus 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “displeased” or “displeased” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where as many as 52 percent of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to Quinnipiac’s poll last week.
However, 44% believe he doesn’t have the personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t have what to look for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the race for the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Complete information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the race for nomination, up from just 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or turned to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of all.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support for Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush, and 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-to-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it’s twice as likely for voters who say they’ve decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign’s opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll by ABC/Post last month, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to a poll by ABC/Post, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of Congressional Republicans, with 54 percent declaring themselves “unpleased” and 21 percent “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's Questions debut
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his Prime Minister's Questions debut, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for “less theater and more facts.”
He also said he could give up a few participations and that he would give them up to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s decision to remain silent on the national anthem at a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and held the front page of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "kept his silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn’s top team, arguing through differences of opinion on economics, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says the policy differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position on the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “head” level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron on the podium in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from retaliation and attacks, committing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will take his place at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the occasional floor, saying he had approached the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to give up the Punch and Judy political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his course.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader’s reasoning, how he leads the House of Representatives, and his position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child found a way to learn a profession and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a rise in the minimum wage in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, the purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher costs for the company’s workforce, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves words of praise rather than criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous skid over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a scoring match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios to the ground, and I should have put him to the ground."
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in the singles, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
“One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit drawn into conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he blamed cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But let’s be honest, he has mastered extremely well in rather challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, he has a great family next door and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, works hard and has joined the team, had no conflict with other players, is highly respected at the dressing room, trains hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think it is worth to be judged exclusively.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account for the important draw, which starts on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the return of the Canberra-born player in the long term.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think about the controversy around [Kyrgios] at all,” said Healy.
And I think Nick climbed up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he is growing up in front of the public and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he doesn't need to take a while.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit lead in the Democratic race to run nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is in second place, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’re going to support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than those of other candidates.
Compared to a CBS poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among the men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is still in the lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a two-figure percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in the group.
About half of the nationally elected Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the top-ranked, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question as to why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the appropriate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race – although a third think he should not run.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, Democratic voters call Biden the majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for office in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general election, but the numbers dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage by which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered unacceptable by these voters as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key characteristics with regard to their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be integrity, trust, and strong leaders.
Biden is seen as the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is integrity and trust, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
With regard to all these aspects, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say that it has not affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the subject in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the controversy over email has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their mind about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democrats consider Clinton to be trustworthy, this issue continues to raise concerns among voters at the general level: only 32 percent consider her to be trustworthy, 8 percent less than last month, and 15 percent less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of national voters do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranked first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be an integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the murder of the student in year 1 of the Faculty of Baruch
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, put a 14-pound bag full of sand behind him, and was repeatedly snatched as he tried to make his way to a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claim it would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They found time to change Deng’s clothes, search for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s president at the national level, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their personal belongings and practically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brothers, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of the Monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with a third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with insult and complicity in murder.
“We want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that authorized the fraternity, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the fraternity and the national fraternity withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will bounce, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few indications of time frame.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should focus not on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize.
In fact, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players may find that all the turmoil related to the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
“The first rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here’s how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating an increase in the interest rate can volatilize things for a while.
However, at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There appears to be a trend for capital return to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the shift in monetary policy again,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what will happen after the Fed’s growth.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards an increase in the interest rate, quite invariably in the period of 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of the Bar.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and the benefits are starting to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic low point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a growth decision from the Fed, with all eyes set on this week’s Federal Open Market Commission meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, futures transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery from the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, bond yields fall immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are that these interest rate increases will bring the yields between short-term and long-term bonds closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds do better in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the expected decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is straighter, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded, and volatility has increased — all the features of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, the companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in the interest rate,” Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains and stocks with low volatility also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the growth of the dollar.
Those who save might also have to gain, although experts don’t agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the radio station for "stupidity"
He claims that he is becoming more and more similar to the commercial opponent.
He also took to the eyes of the BBC Music Awards, claiming that they plagiarized the British awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove that it is doing something the commercial stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station is “stupid” and increasingly resembles the commercial adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘stupid’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I do feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
It also took to the eyes of the BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC director-general denied the accusations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial adversary in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I'm hearing from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think that Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new tracks is also important,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract audiences over the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about <0xC2><0xA3>22m.
Do you understand why there are often discussions related to that show because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be made "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the corporation to “find the golden egg chicken in its own yard” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to forbid in the future the takeover of new seasons of The Voice or to spend the money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August, and the culprit could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the shopping streets of Britain into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in various circumstances, such as from the sofa.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crumbled in front of computers to get their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers fought on the chips, could cause buyers to be reluctant.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to go to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the bin Laden family's sanction, Muslims bury the victims killed in the crane crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the crash of the crane
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crashed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their deaths joined in on the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane crashed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came ahead of the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the crane crash and the Group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegade” son, dispossessed by his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in conditions of strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that relatives of the dead victims should receive one million Saudi Riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
On the banking market, two offers have already appeared for the conversion of loans in Swiss francs in lei, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable interest rate can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting the loans in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to the data compiled by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Transylvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance with the value of risk and administration fees paid by the customer was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefit
The main advantage of borrowing in lei in CHF is that the foreign exchange risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be made in the currency in which he receives his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that no property revaluation is done, no additional guarantees are required, and another proof of income is required.
In practice, no new financial and legal analysis of the loan will be made, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discounts at the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is more of the interest, and the client repays very little of the principal.
Bancpost’s offer with a very low interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
However, it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, to over 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to appear other costs, notmentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is looking forward to the meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less rosy global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor was confronted with the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these certainly come at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bench for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ending with a defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and that will keep him on the line for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident came after a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20, broke PSV's defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital.”
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the next day he'll be operated in Manchester.
“It’s terrible – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, faces difficulties, then plays fantastically and now something like that happens.
His oxygen mask was put on in the locker room.
Crying.
I am not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's fault and red card.
It was a very ugly two-legged intervention.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I’m starting the road to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”
Related news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The England team’s founder has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championships in France next year in June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very ugly injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injure an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very hard for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when he hears it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I couldn't see anything but the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said, “I know what it’s like, I know how hard it is to go through this.
I feel bad fore, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but still stands firm
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a win on the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, represents an option for attack.
Adam Lyth has left England for Test matches and has been replaced by Alex Hales.
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth as the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I’ve said this before – the players are their own selectors.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance wasn’t up to his ability and I’m not surprised by that; first of all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour – when Lyth was in top form – but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is on the team, a very good batsman.
He’s a cricketer who has the “X Factor” and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up next to Cook, which would lead to extra spinners while retaining four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this lefty player has already shown that he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches 38 as the first drop before entering the Open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team on the back-up spinner post and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age — with an average of 31 on the beat and 35 on the ball — and they might think he’s point, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test match consultant could be a master stroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I have always believed that he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the day’s games, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and coaches do not make the program.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Decisions like this are never easy to make.
Brexit camp could win if the economy stays calm until 2017
As the day goes by, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets increasingly tangled up, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy “Yes or No?” Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past days that - plunged into crises similar to those in the EU - not all of which are domestically provoked - some Member States are fueled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they also did not want this if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outward perspective under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says – suggests that more obsessed ministers and officials from certain capitals have come to the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a very cautious ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation shakes up, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is declining.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that they will help the posing English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even deliberately plan to make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “Great Britain has not obtained anything of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know on their skin how skeptical Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic press barons are who look at the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-power of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-tax-paying pouchers, phone fraudsters, and pseudo-non-domestics who own most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same but realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give them bananas to distract them from the thought of eating you at lunch and back to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who reached out to me as a friend back in Westminster on Monday – I told him not to waste his time with me anymore – seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock’s 80s boycott strategy from the egg, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left it vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulge in calling evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the Conservatives’ “Englishism” might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to recognize that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow workers, without going too far and without losing his office in the office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the fight to stay “in any situation” — Benn’s expression — doesn’t match what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and lawmakers at the private meeting Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey – remember, he has also sensitized me – message discipline remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, a focal point of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a favour in Europe, allowing him to take Labour’s good support in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophistry about EU membership – in line with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism about NATO – Tom Watson is steadfast about the fact that JC will not campaign for renunciation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin be wasting political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to the UK when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to the researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry.
The editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, a few researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile base” on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and their foundations “on solid ground or moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell also claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not funding that there are reports that they had received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them there are a few well-known “frontiers” in the production of e-cigarettes, some of whom even state in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control section of the PHE.
The group’s research work “convincingly masks” the lack of “solid evidence about the harmful effect that most products have on most criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded in the past to BMJ’s claims.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that arises and the information that does not arise from evidence, in particular in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease, and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that although the use of e-cigarettes is not without risks, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

Advertisements that shame the UK’s arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Horrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause terrible pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a ferocious hoax, carried out by Amnesty International to emphasize the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Dock.
DSEI Arms Trade Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters in bus stations and subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, do you travel with the DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will sneak up on DLR Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using the Ad Space Hack Packs, a <0xC2><0xA3>6 Allen key pack that it claims "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space from bus stations on the planet."
The London transport director is not amused by this vandalism in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are working with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets commuters circulating by the subway.
The film, made by Amnesty International, had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the pro bono advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and voice dubber also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the arms show ad — with an empty space in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with a more realistic ad, but “enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking.”
“They did a great job helping us raise interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty International.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the theme of the arms fair comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order from the U.S. military on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-mounted launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped focal point that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in the home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed — and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things we have learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving to the home can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
It’s tempting to tell people where you come from, if and where you’ve spent a year off from your studies, what you think of Corbyn and why “honestly, you don’t care about Marmite because, good guys, it’s nothing but my yeast extract HAHAHA, you find me in the room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe as well - ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t even talk to if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinks parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting your student life in a relationship
Introverts receive special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of dormitory squatting is built, based on friendship, socialization, and lifelong friends.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want you to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I’ve consumed interacting with you.”
Try to catch up when a colleague is exhausted by socializing — and try to send an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
It’s about knocking on the door: do it.
A guy sitting in the same house with me had a policy that if a door wasn’t locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends while you’re cooking.
Since you start college in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get to know and bring along a plate of blacks, it seems less weird, less like the 1950s situation, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now she smiles and I ask personal questions."
Homemade goodies are a great way to make friends.
Your co-workers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a good cook.
Coconut flour, sugar, and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone’s chicken is theft, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea is it still theft?
Ask the owner.
It will probably tell you to serve even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying and I understand you – still try to approach the problem more maturely than my co-worker, who dyed his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Don’t make noise that won’t let others sleep or study.
That’s not just because it makes sense, but because you’re on your own.
A girl on the stairs with me asked her neighbor to play the music more slowly because it was 3 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let her sleep for two hours before giving her the maximum time to play the music, she locked the door and left for the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved to the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you confuse a classmate with your future husband, get married, split up, and should meet every day and maybe even see him grabbing all the common friends?
Of course, you can’t resist the heart – but if a sexy classmate is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
At the thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in the room unlocked, the line between prank and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can be distorted in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but do not glue someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tours in Bach’s time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, rightly "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who had a musical repertoire to play.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, Sunday, in which David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, was the soloist, and one Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being unmissable.
Both performances, held on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I speak of instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization is focused on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, makes marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to look, which is stupid again,” Grimal said.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came from the "musical deceptions" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found the creativity and human fraternity in this system.
So, I found no sense in continuing on this path.
So I decided to create Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one was doing this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
“How do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians who no longer have an ego?” he asked.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "In a curious way, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role", says Grimal, adding to the show "Grimal"
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is a “very brave” one, precisely because he invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present and sing 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you invited this strange group”.
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different that breaks down barriers.
Speaking about Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there was also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal campaigns for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the profession of musician, as it is organized today, has a death throes" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don’t need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn’t help.
In Bach’s time, there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before joining the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
With music, the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the tomatoes may not be very beautiful, but when you cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
“If we consider – as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we reintroduce its learning to school, we reintroduce concerts to television, and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education) it has to be in one way, if we want to form a musician, it is completely different.
After your appearance, which is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert smiles come out".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist during the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: the dubbing of two characters from the superproduction "Snow White 3D"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices", giving them an extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on the closeness of the voice of the actor to the specific character of the animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the replicas are funny.
“Children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection, after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then, they have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register playing their own version of the dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the sample: "Yellow Pen 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Pozna<0xC5><0x84> 3D" and "Mayan Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow White 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx's earnings are mixed, lowering 2016 tax forecasts
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant cutting year-over-year profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the bell tolls on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts expected the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages coming into force on January 4th, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to rise compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: "The firm is facing a considerably weaker than expected economic situation, particularly in terms of global production and trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit grew by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, which has led to stagnation in revenue from its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the ground division’s revenues grew by 29% but operating revenues practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher base rates, while revenues recorded by the freight division fell due to rising costs.
On pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday’s closing was down 11% year-on-year and 17% from its record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, policy makers from the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide if the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank’s meeting room, a mural of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and to maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is an unwritten third task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in an overly difficult-to-predict decision to be announced on Tuesday, which will determine whether the U.S. economy is prepared to be challenged by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicates a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials away from adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently anticipated an interest rate hike this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers mitigate the blow by promising it would take a long time until the next hike.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s decision-makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates at this time,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision-makers were to do so, they “should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on the financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate hike this year despite objections from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers total employment.
Salary gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began firing at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below its record high in May, as investors feared the slowdown in China’s economy would slow global growth.
The market fell somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below its May peak.
For the Fed decision-makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate increase.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would have been firmer at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and formerly the Fed official.
Now, he anticipates that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and there is hardly any data to be based on subsequent events in China,” Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been enormous.
The simple allusion of then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “close” its monetary expansion has triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at Envestnet Inc.’s wealth management firm.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that “the Fed has an oversized track record of reacting to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate hike, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that has affected Asia has led the Fed to reduce the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited-identification implications for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reverted to the declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate commission.
The last turbulent period does not rise far to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in the interest rate because the markets have been upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that regard, I don’t think it should be taken prematurely.
Are you looking for an amazing Thai-specific market?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/deposit opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite Channel Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing the party's leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes from the Liberal Party leadership did not bring a significant increase in audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the channel Nine aired from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “cruelty” of distance did not seem to matter too much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the question!

The main news was the startling debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to cope alone with a show without the Rafters star, Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered resoundingly “yes.”
The X Factor show aired by Seven remained in place with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking on The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia’s second night audience drop will give Nine’s silent confidence that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired fire into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a country governed centrally for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was started in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police officers with guns.
“It’s a shame for Europe to apply methods from the 1930s,” Ponta said.
"The Prime Minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and determined at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC Announces 60% Chance of Cyclone South of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands presents a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-loss surgery could be useful in diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in people with mild obesity, with type 2 diabetes, could last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, uses various methods to narrow the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in those who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” — reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the sleeve, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 % vs 5.1) and high haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1% haemoglobin A1c).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on heavyweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona’s Phoenix School of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who had undergone surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic view for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should begin to take the weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long for people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end the violence in the mother countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It is a wonderful care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the US generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, ingestion of hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more access to these products, and unfortunately, one percent of them get to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children drink detergent intentionally and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teens how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it hurts,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergents) are the scented ones.
Hand washes with the aroma of strawberries, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
Hand wash contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital anti-poisoning center, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavoured hand-washing sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was murmuring and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital to identify signs of brain injury because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrifying,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic wet products or napkins and not to leave the hand detergent at the disposal of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher “by putting antibacterials in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and forwarded the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

Griffiths dismantles rumors of misunderstandings
Rumors have surfaced of misunderstandings at Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure as they prepare to face the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don’t think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scots in the race for the title bores the Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax’s ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands, I no longer broadcast the Celtic’s match summary; why?”
Because they're not the Rangers there.
It’s not just about the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the old firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest is.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not only the Scots want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic is struggling but the Norwegian leader has promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, “Celtic have had periods before and they will come back.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's Prudence on January Transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting that he would have identified a few goals for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox team’s drive.
The former head of Brentford said: "The January transfer period is very different from the summer one."
In the case of summer transfer players, there is a pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you may have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that are not needed.
Celtic Targets Michu After Withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he might withdraw when his contract with Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts drove 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2 but the cover red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was caught up after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't have to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I'm playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Board Trusts Management Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board members still have confidence that the management team will change the situation – but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to the Hamilton Accies to get their seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to the penalty kick in the first half executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or in the league, and has not won matches like that.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of employees currently at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in the quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate increasing and the unemployment rate decreasing.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm gonna sit in an observer room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws near, the idea frightens me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can witness executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of seats available, a gruesome lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stand next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to write down what I see.
I'll have to try and remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I cried to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still thinks I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write and I wouldn’t do it even if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present that writes about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I'm not going back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to watch a man I love die uselessly.
Peter Moody Claims Stewards Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to Withdraw From Races
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewards Racing Victoria or attempted to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack against the Stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about the spy statements and didn’t want to resemble “the fox that doesn’t reach the grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that aspect and I’ve been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all swells up all of a sudden,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have stated.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go head-up and I want the owners I work with to see that you are striving to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my coaching job.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man — whose name I’ll tell you if I’m asked — and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Rack.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheat.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can it hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they have to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I am making now could cause them to think about this option.
I’ve come to a point where I don’t care anymore, and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer’s frustration grew with the long-running cobalt testing investigation in which Lidari was involved and his elimination led him to say he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the race-day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, breaking the rules.
It violates the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his foot.
It could've happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment consisting of applying cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that there is a need for rules, but it has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran away from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by an escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
He appears to be accused of fleeing the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is responding to opponents in the wrestling accusations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticisms of his team's plating tactics as "denatured subjects" brought into discussion by the NRL's top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm's players to "take over" the team in Storm's nervously won match in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made an easy reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with the North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two teams were too pricey at Queenland.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's placard tactics and said players simply focused on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two senior coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried that Storm would beat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year round in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in cladding and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
It’s funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing "competitive" football.
Wayne talks about thrilling football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care as much about black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast-paced young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re somewhat concerned about the match with us.
“Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a tougher scoring match compared to the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how long was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean a thrilling game?
Or does thrilling mean taking breaks and not scoring?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the finals of Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then signed in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent pictures of children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos then scanned the computers found at the address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed to have done so to "pull pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it's an addiction - that it's addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to give himself up as a cop to scare away pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the images and about the fact that he asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to seduce.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking or taking indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated conditional release on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court on March 24.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be registered in the sex offenders registry because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody prior to appearances for other files.
He was put on the sex offenders register before the sentence was handed down.
Robert Mugabe, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, sent the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the podium.
It was not hurt, but the shooting of the fall went viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed to have received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to somehow evade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was flogged during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but is titled ‘dead’,” he told reporters after Mr Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company’s restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will split into two companies on the stock exchange, separating the computer and printer division from its growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected deployments will bring costs of around $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP at present and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new style of business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “focus on delivering unrivalled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard was split up into a company whose production of electrical equipment and Palo Alto garage was called the Silicon Valley cradle.
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about the friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is the isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values — our inner desire for personal development and friendship — that further affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by their job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in comfortable chairs, and Ross’ passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call on us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying of coping on your own is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer multiple psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long run.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much objective, external intervention helps, through the phone, people arrived in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate in this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full playback of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his Champions League debut match and helped PSG prevail against Sweden's Malmo.
Below we present the match’s chronicle and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of matches in the Champions League groups, with a calming 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut for PSG, putting the French champions ahead, although they missed a number of occasions before securing their lead with Cavani's goal in the 61st minute.
Reaching Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shaktior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimals but also to improve the course towards the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity for a goal after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the go in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next innings, even if there are other aspects that we need to improve throughout the season,” said Blanc.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we couldn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injuring one of the three changes to the team in Paris, with a 2-2 draw obtained at home from Bordeaux in League 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he peeked at Marco Verratti behind Malmo's defense before incredibly kicking over Johan Wiland in the long right-hand corner.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by tapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic’s shot that passed Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed down several times, taking a few unnecessary steps and not finalizing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his concern being the one Di Maria sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic missed out on Maxwell.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hopes that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from the distance for the rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before the new infielder Ezequiel Lavezzi was canceled an extended goal.
Malmo's Norwegian coach Age Hareide later stated that PSG were with a class over and that "The last match I played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, I have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
The London-listed company Glencore said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is grappling with collapsing commodity prices as China’s declining economic activity impacts demand and wreaks havoc in markets.
The preferential subscription right has raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in transactions on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday's closing price.
He took out 1.3 billion shares of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of the Chinese economy, which is in prolonged stagnation, led to a substantial increase in prices of iron ore by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi insists on broader expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up broader to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and offering a broader market opening.
The state authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to conduct their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called “green cards”, optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Trade unions in education, dissatisfied with the government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education have not reached any results, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from 1 December, with payment to 1 January 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, in November, or one of 20%, in December.
The talks took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The Government’s proposal today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been able to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less for us than we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations in the country the proposal for salary increases, following which the trade unionists will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told unionists that the government is trying to send the Salary Act to parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act foresees an increase of salaries in the education system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase envisaged in the document to be revised in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists the full acquittal of court sentences in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat in which they were stranded collapsed.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey’s coast guard said it had rescued 249 people on board the ship, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries like Syria and Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
The airline Air India lays off about 130 stewardesses because they are overweight, the company announced at the end of last week.
The state-run company said the decision was made for security and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist."
Mass layoffs are the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the busiest stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the new stewardess considered "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on the reflexes and may impede the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a spokesperson for the company said.
A footballer from the Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A football player from Star gives lessons to Gigi Becali in terms of promoting young players.
If the funder of the championship decided to close the football academy in which he invested a considerable amount, the founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" academy will operate in the city of Dej, the locals are waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry materially about training.
They only need to be careful: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They need to value their talents.
This is what he wants to do at the Paul Papp Football Academy.
"I'm also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them," Papp told dejeanul.ro.
At the Academy of the Founder of the Star are expected children up to the age of 11.
The whole party wants to govern.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in power, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants the government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize through a Congressional resolution, we will do so.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give anyone insecurity to the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government in the current government with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
PSD has announced when it will do Congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message is given if the party wants to continue governing or if the party decides to go into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the upcoming Congress.
I will sing on Mondays after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if hesitation in announcing the candidacy had anything to do with his case, Dragnea said he had no problem.
I don’t have the problem you’re referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce to me whether or not a candidacy will be announced when the date of Congress is formally set.
"That's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

Italian arrested at Bors customs with migrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankans were tracked at Bors Customs on Monday as they tried to cross the border illegally, hidden in a semi-trailer of an Italian-driven truck.
After the investigation, it was determined that the two paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the Border Police reported.
At the specific check, border police noticed in the truck cabin a large travel bag containing personal belongings for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border police discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic boxes, two males.
The checks revealed that the two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"At the research, the young people said they intended to arrive in France, a fact for which they contacted a countryman, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were going to receive 2,000 euros per person," the statement said.
The two migrants were charged with "criminal work under the aspect of evading the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border."
Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum brand car, registered in Romania, carrying plastic boxes for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, after being presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied are the Romans in the couple: Men versus women
Most Americans are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents declared themselves "very satisfied" and "satisfied" with the overall quality of the couple's relationship.
"However, 18% appear to be 'unsatisfied users' and 'very unsatisfied' in the couple's relationship, and another 18% declare 'appropriate'," the study concluded, according to a statement issued Tuesday by Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% easily unsatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% declared themselves satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
When it comes to the neutral (correct) state, we see a difference of two percent.
"Also in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is recorded in the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent," the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romans (26%) spend an hour or even less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also report that "Romanians feel the need for something more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, self-control 14%, education 12%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training between 1 June and 1 September on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe is once again ashamed of itself.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe was "ashamed" after the failure of Monday's ministerial meeting in Brussels to allocate refugees within the European Union.
“Last night (Monday night), Europe was once again embarrassed,” said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Economy Minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.
German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re has suggested reducing the EU’s structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migrant crises in Europe after 1945.

Thousands of people came to light a candle.
Thousands of people have passed through the coffin with the soulless body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people not dying at St. George's Church than at the sanctification of the house or the Great Temple of St. Nicholas, said on Wednesday, the parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in line, stretching from the entrance to the church to the side streets, to pass on to the catafalque on which was the coffin with the soulless body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
People wait about an hour to get to the Church of St. George New, where groups of 40 people enter.
About 300 people per hour passed through the coffin with the soulless body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor on Wednesday.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova have come, starting on Tuesday, to pay homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people we have had only at the 300-year refinement of the church and at the Great Temple of St. Nicholas.
"Cornelius Vadim Tudor has been at the 300-year re-education of the church and has been with the members of the Holy Synod, Blessed Daniel and the representatives of the five patriarchs who participated in the re-education," said the parish priest of the church in the capital, Emil Caramizaru.

It is extraordinary the behavior of these people, they are good, with dignity, children, old people, people in carts, as if they were at a great religious celebration.
“It is exciting to see them waiting to bow down and pay their last homage to Vadim Tudor,” said pastor Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of the family of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the church will remain open on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, last night being closed at 01.00 and reopened in the morning, at 07.00.

The priest wanted to make clear that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 8 p.m., and then asked him to open the shrine with the nuns of St. Nicholas and remained to pray for minutes in the heart.
He came here very often, usually in the evening, after 8 p.m., he asked me to open his scabbard with the remains of St. Nicholas and he prayed.
He said it was a great blessing this church of Brancoveanu.
He said to me: "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Mihai Viteazul, who took the hand of St. Nicholas".
“You realize what a blessing it is for this country,” Vadim told me, the priest told me.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is due to be buried Thursday at Ghencea Civil Cemetery with military honors.
The Senate leadership on Tuesday rejected the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's wife that the coffin with the soulless body of the former senator be deposited in the hall of the Legislative Chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on November 28, 1949, in Bucharest, he was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Greater Romania Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
What Happens to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep was faced with a crucial decision for her career, as she had to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician joining the romance only on major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in the face of the sporty whimsical.
However, Adidas’ program will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or whether to withdraw from the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, he is requesting a contract of about one million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last event Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team last fall.
The former coach confessed that he did not get along with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national team.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
At the moment I am not sorry that I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, I left a job behind.
I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selection officer was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, learn different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted me to stay, I proposed a contract extension.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, and we are going to have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't speak to Burlean, I spoke to his right hand.
“He agreed, but only if we finish first in the group,” Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminary round.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Blinds and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police dispatched Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns to the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday when cannons with water and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary raising a fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
“We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary’s security by any means possible,” said Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi.
Police tried to control with cannons of water and tear gas the crowd of people throwing with plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities have reported that dozens of migrants have broken the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to penetrate the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants from the communal border.
There are reports that the Serbs have supplemented their forces at the border.
Following the incidents on Wednesday, Budapest suspended the crossing from the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to secure access for immigrants.
If on Tuesday he announced that in addition to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia he will raise one on the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the erection of a fence on the border with Croatia.
Rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was presumed by his family to be an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was obvious that he was in a state of intoxication.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought, 'Maybe he's drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he simply did not admit, “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
“It was horrible, I didn’t remember anything.”
In addition, his wife, who, although he doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breathing also smelled of alcohol.
Nick’s most thoughtful moment was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he was found to have three-fold alcoholemia above the legal limit, although he had only consumed one beer the night before.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, the body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who guessed that this could be Nick's illness was actually his wife.
The disease doesn’t have a cure yet, but since she gave up on carbs, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use, BT reports.
The entire scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, to the delight of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that endangered his life and his family.
His marriage occurred when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he had agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through in its efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on the national territory", according to a press release.
The cited source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and guidelines of action that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are considered for the unified and coherent management of situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature.
"Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with migration potential or who may harm national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the neighboring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promotion of legal migration, more stringent controls of the legality of the residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include relevant specific objectives for the implementation and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-country nationals who meet the employment needs of the labour force, facilitating access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government believes that it is “a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon”.
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among the EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to expenditures on the staff of employers.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labor rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU to increase the cost of labor
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance in labour costs in Romania in the period April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly labour cost in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labor cost.
Activity report of TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Culture Committees of the Parliament on Wednesday rejected the activity report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
Seventeen lawmakers voted to reject the report, one against the rejection (Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the meeting of the Permanent Bureaux.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be debated.
"I believe that given this situation, it will be done relatively quickly," Georgia Severin, the president of the Senate Culture Committee, said.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was good to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the members of the CA last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the reunited Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting it.
I believe that the moment you are summoned, you are a budget worker, you are paid from public fees and you are summoned to a meeting of the reunited commissions even if you do not like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the session of the Parliament's culture committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I will remind you that it is not my fault or that of any of these committees that that pleasure with the banks and with the tax has been lost, it is clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the plenary meeting, elections will be held for a new Board of Directors, and it will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote, choose with great reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it should have - good feeling in the attitude towards employees because it is a curse of petitions that come from employees, complaints, layoffs.
“When you get 50, 60, 70 referrals like this, something is rotten and we’re talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not present himself to Parliament, the president-general director of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of public television broadcasting, among them
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the amendment and addition of HG 978/2003 on the public television service tax, for the purpose of updating the provisions on current technological changes, as well as for the regulation of the procedure on the control of the payment of the TV tax and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
Stelian Tanase requests the reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to 3%, as well as the amendment of the law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget allocations/financing for the purchase of licenses for major cultural events, the Euro Bowl, the Campion
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the coming months, given that labour legislation obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are respected with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on TV staff and production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News station was closed," the letter said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only through his own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later find itself unable to carry out its public mission," the letter said.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL, with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specializing in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The Sikhs have determined the fate of Sanmartean
The six members of the Al-Ittihad club have determined the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, Ladislau Boloni's impresario, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays title match and does it well.
The Sikhs also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been possible to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been achieved," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
The plenary of the Parliament voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 "for" and 108 "against" votes were recorded.
The vote was secret, with ballot papers.
The NLP representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, according to Digi24.
The Liberals have criticized Sarbu's appointment to the post and announced that they will contest it at the CCR, given that he has a DNA record but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD senator will serve as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained vacant after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was declared unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play the role of a chef in the film Burnt, the actor made a revelation his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I’ve worked most of my life as a chef.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen for 15 years when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so the whole childhood he cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
“It’s not at all motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you’d laugh at if I told you,” he said, adding that what he wanted from his childhood had come true.
When he reached the age of 40, the actor admitted that he saw himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who began directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday sharply condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that Hungary's political decision-makers are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, mocks the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania's domestic policy," the head of Hungarian diplomacy said.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges that come from Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Shame, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with precisely these goals and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, arguing that such statements are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" are rooted in Romania's domestic political crisis and said Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, they are medieval nonsense and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the whip and with the insertion.
"I do not agree with that," the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the expansion of the fence it is building at the border with Romania, to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence did not solve any of the refugees' problems and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What is the relationship between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane in Mecca?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi-owned Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, an accident in which 107 people were killed.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company "did not comply with safety rules," the Saudi news agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors were barred from leaving the country until the investigation into the case was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaeda terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of the former terrorist leader, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Grand Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, crashed on the eastern side of the Grand Mosque roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi Shuts the Mouth of Protesters
Considered by many to be the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he sponsors.
Fixed one year after the team's takeover, the King has demonstrated that he is able to turn a team struggling to save from downgrading into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 remises and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights at the European cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team came second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, although he brought to the team more experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently in the starting team have appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The policy of the club has made the Future a tracking team for teams abroad, so Hagi sold this summer 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Alongside the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the EU’s seventh country.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the purely policing means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the current situation."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC President, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the forecasts said they had the necessary votes.
Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity was applied in the JAI and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it by a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it’s a sensitive issue, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s policy of opening up, and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as a “EU sends migrants on our heads.”
They have thus postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governing body and we will probably see big changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be abandoned, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece overflows, you can't say it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European states are going to take up migrants: you’re going to country X or country Y.
It is likely to reach some unique filtering centers in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem has no simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is difficult to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave maybe even greater.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really managed to integrate large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
There is an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But pure means of cops won't work.
Let us create a fortified and illusory Europe.
We need to move to integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
We ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family including through convenient marriages.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, that doesn’t mean we have to look at them drowning in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come up with.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t think, it doesn’t mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortifications within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in jeopardy?
The European project as such no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we're free to move around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave can not be so, because some countries do not face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run, it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we don’t have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of warlike statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European single market.
And I don’t think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the current situation.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which thinks that if it pulls the hat on its eyes and sticks its ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country’s problem.
We did that, it’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the EU’s seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says maybe it's good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the desperation of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants see us as an alternative route.
Which is not to say that this is a reason to stop entering Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be single rules of acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one has died.
Is there a connection between the two fires, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means messing with the Americans and the Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years ago, there was a battle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then ISIS rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are a great power only if you also have solutions.
Playing on the off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, for him to press the buttons to solve the situation.
Offerings don’t come because the world isn’t convinced that it can solve some sort of issue created by it.
But I don't agree with theories that say these people are handled by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What a button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of “Dislike”.
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account that this button will be available soon, the New York Times reported on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a mere option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg has mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give “likes” to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving like that post,” the Facebook representative pointed out.
A new button on Facebook has not been well received by everyone.
“There’s already enough hate on Facebook and social media,” said Afghanistan’s Atiq Haneef on the New York Times’ Facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary on Tuesday accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands arriving at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA said.
Mesura has attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the imposition of new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the county council is on the rise.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the building’s consolidation and re-functionalization work had been completed, the work did not even reach halfway.
A final stage in the building's epic was consummated the previous days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the work that is still to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company is going to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works is organized.
"Negotiations were not concluded by a contract, but CJ said that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, who represented public relations at CJ.
The CJ decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the opportunity to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be considered finding another designer.
Thus, the work to strengthen the building could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we have to reach the conclusion of a contract.
“We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not,” Timofciuc said.
Work to consolidate the former headquarters of the Police Department began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refunctionalization and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, I say everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, led by his former boss, Narciz Nedelcu.
An adviser from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi accused of DNA in a corruption case has acknowledged his telefax.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Tribunal, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of intellectual falsification in continued form and agreed to execute two years in prison with postponement, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to the acts charged to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors stated that he, as the adviser of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "has falsely drawn up several minutes of acceptance, in addition to the service contracts in the previous way by O.C.P.S.C.S.
In the past few days, the former head of the Office, Narcisa Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to court in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to the mentioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Pre-trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women’s handball national team for qualification to the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania’s women’s national handball team, “the main goal is qualifying at the Rio Olympics, but for that it has to go through two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament,” Dedu said.
We are looking forward to qualifying for the Olympic Games.
These are fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two butlers, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification for some things, specifically physical training materials, that we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. and I will do everything in my power to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with preparation.
“The teams we are fighting with have these materials and have had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he was trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It’s an infrastructure issue and it’s shameful to be questioned about a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage pit, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same thing happened in London, where the organization of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
“In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but very quickly it became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want to, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and after that we discuss concretely.
“So we have all the opening, both at EHF and at IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in the prognosis, that if they do not fulfill they turn against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said at a press conference on Tuesday that all the components of the Romanian lot are ready for matches at the World Cup in England, where he hopes to get two wins: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.

I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I want to not disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
The Romanian national team’s coach Lynn Howells, who was at the beginning of his coaching experience at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: “It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup”.
I’m sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me, it is an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team at every match.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC8><0x99>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes good luck and I am confident that we will be at the height of the event.
“These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to realize a dream,” Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F> said.

14 million lei you give to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" in Iasi at the correction of the budget
What will you buy with this large amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received for use by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and arrangement of clinics, as well as in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new computer tomograph, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of properly equipped ATI, ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary for the conduct of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and decoration works of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the coming days we will be receiving work from the walkway linking UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transportation of the patient from UPU to the neighboring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form in which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The deck, made fun of by RATP controllers and a flyer.
P<0xC4><0x83><0xC8><0x9B>ani of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience lived, neither I nor my wife ever want to step into your city again.
Inadvertently, they were struck by the erroneous information in the leaflets, the numbness of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Center and requested tourist leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>ul.
But two days ago, while in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Since there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they can get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said the two-year service was no longer available and that it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
HOW DO I KNOW what was written in the local press, I come with an evening before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation to them, they said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting the stand at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of erroneous information on the flyer and controllers who "enforced the law on blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Ghinion for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and were in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has moved since yesterday to the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Outgoing magistrates judged the first trial term in a non-public hearing in which the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the trial, one of the outgoing judges to whom the file had been allocated, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
Until the summer of this year, the magistrate was active at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Nale Section, he was the one who, on 9 April, admitted an appeal made by four of the defendants, ordering their detention at home.
Currently, the case is being judged by a complete case of which the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu are members.
Earlier in the case, Judge Dan An Tone also expressed his abstention, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the rapists’ lawyers.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui should remain in pre-trial detention.
These blacks will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the judges will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on October 6.
Before arriving at the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the van with which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident produced in the P<0xC4><0x83>curarii district, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco trucker carrying the seven rapists hit a Volks wagen car that had come out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>curari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on to Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport, to take over the detainees.
Shortly after, a car was sent to the scene of the accident from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the Nile cars, and the detainees came out in speed, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the two cars have amicably agreed on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Madalin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what comes next.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and skewed: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize represent, in themselves, an insignificant but huge number compared to the Romanian state’s ability to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of their rapid integration into Romanian society are extremely small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Paralyzed by interlopers and paralyzed by a venomous political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent health care, collect street rubbish, create honorably paid jobs, or keep their own generation.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first struck by the belligerent hypocrisy of the strong states of the EU, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably afraid of someone stealing his national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, betting strictly on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and outdated structure.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have a future plan either.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
Then what is the EU doing if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what comes next.
7,000 euros a year to rent Club Pogor.
Destiny, practically, imposed
The concession auction shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concessions for a duration of 10 years.
The building has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of coarse.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of the literary cafe, bookstore or other culturally-profiled activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be prepared.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public catering unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently necessary during the procedure during the operation of a building," the document reads.
The club's concession bids are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-old and 11-year-old children from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, siblings, swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken to the hospital "S<0xC3><0xA2>nta Maria" in Ia<0xC5><0x9F>i.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the 90s, when she had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years in which the adoption was vaguely regulated, a young outcast couple, now a blonde and beautiful daughter.
Crina will be 20 years old, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought about giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to know her unclear past.
The "Journal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i", which attended the efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague indications, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporters’ reporting, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home, there were misunderstandings between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl, and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
“When I found out he was in the hospital, it was too late,” Alina, the biological mother of the girl, recalls.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pa<0xC5><0x9F>cani, and her father, Costica Balkan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be definitively separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After hospitalization, Crina’s father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She would have thought she was abandoned,” one of the family’s granddaughters said.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child in all this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Iasi, which then gave her to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more loosely regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love instead with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would definitely move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our daughter.
“It’s like my wife gave him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiles as he grabs the girl’s hand.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costica, continued their separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but received no response where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may be dead, but in Iasi, the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was going to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions to look for it I never had.
We prayed to God that it would be well.
I've thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find it.
"It's hard," says Cryna's biological mother with tears in her eyes.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” says Crina excitedly.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Iasi Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advising, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only received one name, Coastal Balkans, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is by the locality the name received.
Then they gave me some clues, only that the person they found was not the one they were looking for.
“It took about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” Romic<0xC4><0x83> chief commissioner Ichim said.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since they each had their home in another locality.
We started the process somewhere in March, and in the months of June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costica saw for the first time their lost daughter in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could barely control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely changed a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," tells us a granddaughter, who also came with Costic<0xC3><0xAD>a from Ruginosa.
Crina’s meeting with her mother and biological brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-ranked university in Italy, Costica Balkan told him, among other things, that if she ever wants to come back to him, in the village, come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and crouch her.
The mother is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking all these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
These are very big emotions.
If you could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a tie," she tells us with tears on the cheeks Alina, Crina's mother, while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In him she hides her tears of happiness, for she will soon see her face after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be only a few days away, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she sketched out a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
After all, my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
“I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say,” says Crina.
First family reunion in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In Unirii Square, under the sky of early autumn, the Ruginosa family reunites their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, she finishes high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It is no longer dividing borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>ului, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so again.
It’s the first event of its kind, with such an emotional load, and I’m happy to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
“If I’m asked for another such event, I’ll do it with great love,” says Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Iasi Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advising.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, moves away.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns on foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone draws their soul.
Camps in the PSD’s outlying branch have concluded a ceasefire with a gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s positions.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have taken only a pause to allow the fighters to pull their souls.
The dragon did not give an ultimatum.
He released a very simple and very current message in the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
We have a party election on October 3rd.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of discussions over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing definite has been established.
At the elections in October, a fierce competition is expected for the position of president of the county branch of PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the party’s outlying branch are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councillor Vasile C<0xC4><0x83>tea and Interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added.
A variant considered is the candidacy of the leader of the county councilors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the subsidiary, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be submitted candidatures, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all the new leadership structures," C<0xC3><0xA2>tea said.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the PSD county branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections will be practically provided by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councilor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team dealing with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD presidency of Iasi, the list remains open," Stanciu said.
A judge refused the case of the rapists in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Vaslui residents sentenced to five years to eight months to eight years to four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the court of law, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The case was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton claimed that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this case.
How the Judges Motivated the Judges
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people justified the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported him, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public.
"The court finds that after the moment of placing the vessel under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not depriving of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and their local supporters, it has been felt at the level of the local and national community that there is a strong feeling of indignity.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
“The court emphasizes that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they formulated, since a person’s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext,” the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue in the years to come.
Until Saturday, few people in Romania probably knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in the UK, many are wondering to what extent the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labour Party.
Declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (at one point asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on the political events by the British television channel "Himbolsh as he miesia" and "Himbolsh as he is today").
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he gave up on the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic program of the new Labour leader envisages, among other things, massive renationalizations and printing money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted around the world, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who would prevent such details?
Of course, we can charge blood to the bankers, become a kind of enemy of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The extra money is quickly swallowed up by generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point other people’s money runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in beliefs as the party's fresh leader, failed lamentably in the election.
And then there was still in Britain a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were much more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the overall workforce, and extensive automation has made the industry massively in need of highly skilled workers, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis shaking from the foundations of the EU you get to an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which was to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of capital symbolic for the whole European project and the deep bankruptcies created within it by the Euro crisis and now the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
The more so for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which anyway Berlin became increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s stay in the EU.
Today’s Europe is no longer the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, as we have only recently seen in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration and Eurosceptic formations is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
This is the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation starting from the national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we are witnessing a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity that they have enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue in the following years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU can greatly affect the intensity of the situation.
And it’s hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
They say, "Take and sweep the workshop."
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him in the whole world.
But behind his fame lies something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called trude.
What to write about Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i produces and delivers money almost 60 years since it is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear its name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the toddler, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i."
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is huge.
Even the Communists failed to remove it from Romania’s memory and culture.
His quotes today span the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would there be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you're not lucky enough to be born in a big city and in a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the idiot success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, heard about him a whole world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in the municipality of Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which he would collect the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "Then life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have led, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come to us.
But Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor years spent in his native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the boiler was made, watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with cinnamon and drinks on the unbreathed.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then in hysteria, believing that her son has died.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by praises, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those who await him with their souls at their mouths.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about the burial.
However, someone finds that it is good to call Baba Br<0xC3><0xA2>ndu<0xC5><0x9F>a, a perfumer and servant of the Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i.
The stew checks the baby’s breath, then puts the horse’s nose under it, gathered around it.
The child sneezed loudly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drunkenness, joy, the party with cheers continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the meadow.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i puts Constantin to collect some nuts and bring them to him.
The father places his child with his head down and, with the nuisances brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And, while feeling the throbbing of blows, little Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i has the revelation that the world can be viewed from a different perspective and that things around can turn upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not somehow the star itself participates in his disorder.
Would the sun have been as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
At the moment, the city is not working.
A member of parliament appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
Independent MP Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3> called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political stage is a big split and that’s it.
I haven’t seen any of the USL projects from 2012 that will continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you only see how politicians dispute their possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let’s put a little bit of politics aside, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
“If you’re busy with the internal war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” said Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut.
He estimated that the current political class has decimated the local electorate, the consequence of which will be a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that voters will also focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, as is the party "For Ia<0xC8><0x99>i" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break away from the right-wing electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civicly active people, who are usually right-wing.
“It breaks even more right, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3> said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, refuting rumors about his intention to run for mayor.
I have also said that I do not want to run for any local office.
I am still thinking about whether to continue as a member in the future term.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi and in the discussions in the halls with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut, who said that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A colleague from Tatarasi said that his money was not enough and he had to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
It's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up cash from the cashier.
At the end of my term of office, I will report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of the cabinet employees and their maintenance.
I happened to pick up in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and the rest.
"To say that money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Bl<0xC4><0x83>jut concluded.
