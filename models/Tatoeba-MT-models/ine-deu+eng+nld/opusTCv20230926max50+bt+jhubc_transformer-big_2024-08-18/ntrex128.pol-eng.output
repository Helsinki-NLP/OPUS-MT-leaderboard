Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, consternation prevailed. This is the result of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was created in connection with plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene worry that they may become the subject of jokes.
One Labour Party MP expressed his group’s concerns, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "outcasts".
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party said that his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party is "open" to changing the name. However, he noted that the wording of the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee currently working on the draft law renaming the Assembly took the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will be their own”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative solutions. The difficulties in reaching consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules on dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be named the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts by the state to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's Church in New York are still ringing in connection with the troubled churches in Harlem
“The older people I talk to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is currently no trace of them.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people are socializing in a different way,” he said.
“Bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community.”
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the funds derived from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as the decision-makers think, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point”.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other nearby temples.
As he said: "The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the complete closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes".
Both churches were built by the White Faithful Assembly before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the thirties of the last century.
The surrounding assembly of African-Americans then took over ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors on 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of African-Americans.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, however, John Howard Johnson parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell complex.
Rev. David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the new carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who struck the bells in July, described them in a different way, as a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first black musician-operated carillon. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events in the church of St. Martin with the participation of architects and performers, some of which were brought to the site by lay church leaders and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, saying that it "wants to pass on the costs to the council", although the council did not take part in hiring the architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
Authorities said last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster-seeking lobster diver in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they rushed to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but soon he realized that the child was shouting: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely torn skin around his collarbone.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego. His condition was determined to be critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to be a dangerous shark.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
For investigation and security reasons, authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s store network plans to expand its operations in the UK cosmetics market
The Sainsbury’s network throws a glove at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing style-oriented cosmetic departments to their supermarkets, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly growing despite declines in the fashion industry and household items – in 11 stores belonging to the network will appear larger shelves with cosmetic products. If successful, the initiative will be extended next year.
The return to the cosmetics industry stems from the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. The assortment will include products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Currently sold items by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its Boutique makeup product offering. From now on, most of the articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will create test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores makes supermarkets have to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury’s, said sales outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight off discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and has been introducing a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased food sales and increased return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint venture with Boots on trial. However, the cooperation was terminated as a result of a conflict over the division of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve redesigned the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to enhance customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so they can help consumers with their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of making purchases".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of the television program Dragons' Den, was "angry" when he learned that Holly Willoughby was planning to withdraw from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a newfound partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name Truly.
The business has often been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a newfound collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den program.
According to the sources, Peter Jones was "angry" when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to devote his time to the truly-dedicated accompaniment of their brand.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was also to double Holly Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After announcing the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his holiday homes.
Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to her and wanted to take care of her for decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to entering the market.
In the warehouse in Marlow, the goods are ready for sale.
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of This Morning and one of the UK’s most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including items from pillows to candlesticks to clothing and household items to clothing – as well as homemade items.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a ten-year relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March as president.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones held a 40 percent stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president joked about the media's criticism of the remarks made, which some considered "unfit for a state man", as well as a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump done so much?
Trump said in a laughing voice, pretending to be a television presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting, the first meeting in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are being delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a “analog response” from the United States to North Korea’s early actions aimed at disarming North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and exerts pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had brought positive results: they led to the end of the missile tests, helped to free the hostages and return the remaining U.S. troops home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach while discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get into a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid activities.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not demanding international support, so the situation is difficult,” Selina Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear whether international staff will be able to operate at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national agency for natural disasters, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to check whether aid from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a siren warning of the Palu tsunami — despite a warning — likely affected the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, travelling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the target.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s infrastructure the main focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the run-up to next year's elections, the administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the ongoing religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of residents lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, shots and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge wins a draw goal in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received an application from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal at a 1:0 to the detriment of his team.
Before firing a shot in the direction of a distant goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball scratched high above the penalty area in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
Then she came to the gate, flying over Kep Arrizabalaga, who was throwing himself at her.
“I was just trying to take the position and accept the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to take it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot possible,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed the approaching Kante, I took the ball and fired the shot without further thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the game after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>'s heel and then ran towards half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the court.
He then made a beautiful play forward in the penalty area back to Hazard.
Gambling outstripped the defenders and left footed a long arrow towards Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
According to the Indonesian disaster agency, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency reported that many people were trapped under the rubble as a result of a 7.5-degree earthquake on Friday. In addition, the shock caused a tsunami wave of 6 meters high.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of debris collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
After the body of a woman was found this morning in the village of Birkenhead in Merseyside County, an investigation into the murder has been launched.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are asking to contact people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious incident.

I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular taxi drivers, whose registrars could have secured useful materials during the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman resided in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into the residential building, but was informed by police that entering and leaving the facility is currently prohibited.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes in the near future.
One of the officers was heard explaining to the man that the area is currently considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were stationed in the fenced-off area, and another police vehicle was parked next door.
Inside the separated zone are the officers who guard the residential building.
Those with information are requested to contact us via Twitter (<0x40>MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or to make an anonymous notification via Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, with the event number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell Memorial to British Parliament Last Victim in ‘Writing History Again’ Dispute
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the reminiscent actions of the Taliban in the destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanical supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
Imagery during the English Civil Wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the monument shows what opinion this politician enjoyed in the nineteenth century and that for many people he is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was seen by many people – perhaps more often in the 19th century than today – as a defender of parliament from external pressures.
The assessment of the relevance of this statement is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
In China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, a deadly pig attack on a farmer took place on a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and having a ruptured artery near a cattle market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuejczu.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the man’s body and noticed an open door to a nearby broth.
He said there was a big pig in the cage with blood on it.
The corpse section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that had fatally crushed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and swollen,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that while the evidence was being collected by the police, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man was fatally wounded.
Ten years ago, in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig shoved a farmer into a tractor. The husband's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, however, the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to play.
They're as curious as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Will Cause Heavy Rainfall in Southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is winding at a speed of almost 137 km/h. At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, it was awarded Category 1 status, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean it begins to form than heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of humid air to the north, to the south.
On Monday, it will bring precipitation of up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwestern United States.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm in height will lead to sudden flooding, pollution movements and possible landslides in desert areas.
Humid tropical air will cause precipitation somewhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is especially true in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the Southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical precipitation, sudden flooding and abrupt changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rains, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot in the desert.
Abundant tides can turn canyons into swollen rivers, and storms with thunderstorms will cause local winds and the movement of dust.
Coming soon than will bring abundant local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to rain with a total height of more than 1.3 cm, which can cause small movements of pollutants and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Flooding tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and Tuesday, precipitation will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
Temperature fluctuations may occur in October along with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, but the intervertebral zone will be rather warm.
This can lead to sudden changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the states.
Between Kansas City (state of Missouri) and Omaha (state of Nebraska) and between St. Louis (state of Missouri) and Des Moines (state of Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, warm temperatures are expected in early October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern Great Plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature may reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations Thursday’s hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political stalemate on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcasting programs to inform of a sudden comeback: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford has testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh was imprisoning her in a state of sobriety and trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation had not taken place.
It’s possible that Friday’s number of TV viewers was even higher than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the figures were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring viewership among people in the workplace.
The given number is similar to the viewership of the American football cup competitions or the awards ceremony of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel station, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during a full-day audition.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the topic remained high at the end of the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the morning, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the video, he shouts at protesters who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to a court hearing.
Flake, with his head down for a few minutes, listened to unfavourable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you and asking.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have strength in the face of the disease of so many women," he said from the woman demonstrating.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the committee's hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events in anticipation of a vote to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the indictment next week, which a minority of Democrats insisted on.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations made by Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the headliner Theresa May, the former foreign minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could levy duties on their behalf, calling it "completely unreasonable".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested the suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player appearing in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to reports, Baton Rouge police command of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS-affiliated WAFB station, police officers found the glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
Police said after Simpson's interrogation that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer, the amount of the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Search Team, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s director of sports, thanked local law enforcement for “working hard and striving for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge and his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball in the LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “destroyed” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“It’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” said Will Wade.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters advised Mexicans to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The center recorded numerous rumblings and shocks.
Images posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s Xochimilco neighborhoods.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between demonstrators supporting the independence of Catalonia with preventive police forces. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the evoking extreme emotions of the referendum on the secession.
A group of masked proponents of the separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust conspired the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also took place in the later part of the day. In order to stop the fighting the police force used a stick.
For several hours, independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, while opponents of the secession shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, the tensions did not subside. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the desirous Catalan secessionists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but the turnout was low due to a wide-ranging boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people who support the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had some of the most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck at a point with no way out," he said.
Despite a significant but minor victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty in continuing their activities. Many of the most recognizable leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting an arrest later in the trial due to their roles.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording a police-backed protest over the phone, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his willingness to start next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Candidates in the European Parliament elections are the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Driving Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time (BST).
Commissioner for Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage had covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car could also have been shot with a broom.
Mengi's goal secures Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengi's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Beginning this season, Livingston stunned the Rangers with a second loss to Steven Gerrard in his 18 games as Ibrox Park's coach.
Dolly Mengi's goal proved to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains without a Premiership win this season. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of the Hearts, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, because already on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the competition of the UEFA European League.
Livingston extends a series of victories in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not experienced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a few chances against unseen opponents
The team led by Holt should have covered the lead much earlier, as the team's game gave the Rangers a lot of trouble.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired a shot into the light of the goal, but failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed after taking over the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could endanger rivals during constant game snippets.
And that is how the decisive gate came down.
After being released by the Rangers, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created a situation for Menge, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to force the hosts' defenses and did not cause further problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half. Alfredo Morelos gave one shot to Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's rehearsal was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get into the light of the goal from another permanent snippet of the trial for Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty shots after Halkett's intervention against variable Glenn Middleton and one hand play. However, in both cases, the players' claims were rejected.
“Phenomenal” performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the extra-class, but Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very attentive throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under the leadership of Gerrard, they have not kept their standards in the game.
In their game, something seemed to be missing: only once did they manage to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed Reactions to Erdogan's Visit to Cologne
During a Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turks outside their homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the temple was blocked, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to express their views, condemning the policy of Turkey’s leader and the German government’s decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the divisions aroused by the visit of a politician who was hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies as a result of car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near a crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the southeastern borough of the city, at around 10:15 British time (BST).
After the accident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist took place on Childers Street (about a mile and a half from the scene of the accident) and the perpetrator fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the officers were working on identifying the deceased man and informing the family members about the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six officers injured as a result of riots
According to the authorities of the institution, six officers were injured as a result of riots in the penitentiary for men with an increased level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. British time (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In one of the wings of the facility, a specialised unit “Tornado” was called for the riots involving eight prisoners.
Officers on the scene suffered minor injuries to the face.
A plant spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six of the officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports, in June, the plant manager had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, prevention teams were called to the plant due to the dangerous riots in which employees were attacked with balls to play billiards.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-stricken areas)
It rarely happens that the tropical depression reaches the state of Arizona. It is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Remains of Hurricane Rosa are moving through the deserted areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The forecast for Rosa on Tuesday is clear with scattered showers. Light rain on Monday afternoon will dominate for a time.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm in height. In some areas, the Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the rest of the desert areas of the Southwest – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Barrier Reef – precipitation is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa can bring relief, as the region has been battling drought for some time.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the precipitation will improve the situation in the southwest, where the drought conditions prevail.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona’s area is struggling with severe droughts in the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first hit the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. Currently, she is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
It is forecast to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood risk.
Weather.com reported that “in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora state, precipitation is expected to be between 7 and 15 cm high, although it can reach 25 cm.”
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in a northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression. Until Tuesday evening, it will migrate to the southern part of the state of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora State and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
According to forecasts, the rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollutants in the desert and mud avalanches in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old man found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m.
The victim was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers are requested to contact all persons who have recordings of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh “Recognized the Ugliness and Anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reprehensible and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “fell the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing of the allegations made by her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the Americans could see the brilliance, class and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of support for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, an expert in the law of great merit for the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a dinner in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the mid-term presidential election.
“The most important choices in our lives are five weeks apart.
I’m not running in this election, but I’m still very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resisting and hindering activity.”
As one of the assistants of an important Republican politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed - many of whom were kidnapped by high waves crashing into beaches - in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival taking place in the city. At dusk, waves hit the shore reaching up to 6 meters high, capturing many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the threat arose yesterday, people on the beach did not escape immediately and fell victim to the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency BNPD, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything in its path, taking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho reported, adding that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency for natural disasters show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, there have been a number of earthquakes.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday Earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people are believed to be missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication "has been completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from Donggala province.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s employees and volunteers are going to places affected by the disaster.
“We can already speak of a tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate significantly,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video posted on social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn people on the street about the upcoming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed along the shore, snatching up buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in power supply, preventing communication within Palu. This in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
According to authorities, the military has started sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, however, the evacuated people still very much need food and other basic items of primary need.
The airport located in the city is only open for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
More than 800 people were killed in the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinay, World Vision’s national director, the organization’s staff arrived safely from Donggal Province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tents with tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to bring aid, there have been criticisms that foreign aid workers with a wealth of experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, reception of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a disaster of regional scope,” said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government finds that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not yet happened.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing are still hoping that their loved ones will somehow find themselves amid the destruction.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canals.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two missing paragliders to take part in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono told reporters that within hours of the paratroopers reporting the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling cash at ATM in Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a statement from police in Newport, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling up cash at an ATM in the Newport on the Levee shopping center on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man “ran back to Brink’s employee” and stole the bag of money from the ATM.
Witnesses said they had seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thieves are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time now. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change came before a visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album called Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, resigned from the program “for emotional reasons”.
West has previously stated that the word “Ye” is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in Scripture it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it’s about us.
At first I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and tangled traits.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under the aliases Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, also wrote down his pseudonym in various ways, with a link, without a link, and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vows not to use military forces against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The incident occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support the young people of Mexico by providing monthly financial assistance to students as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities pushes young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area grows, the United States should double its spending on research in the field of AI.
The remark has to do with artificial intelligence announcements made by various U.S. government agencies, even though the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“First of all, we need to double the budget for IS research: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Superpower of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Inc., is the president of the most important company in the Sinovation Ventures.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create the SI system, which defeated the then best American player in Othello. He then held a managerial position at Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous technology initiatives of the US government, e.g. organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the next edition of the competition, because it will not be possible to find a date for the next edition of the competition.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It is not China that is taking away from us the best representatives of academia, but corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop SI.
“I think that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence who have obtained a PhD should automatically be awarded a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the US National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations, however, granting funds to American scientists is more important than the quality of academic activity in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAI), which will engage partners in industry and science, and the White House has announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion allocation for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion annually in research on SI.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national AI safety commission has not moved forward in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, on whose territory the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory. Therefore, it has vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the attendance would reach the minimum 50% required to consider the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – joining such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will give us all greater security,” said Oliwera Georgijewska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The National Electoral Commission reported that no unusual incidents had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, attendance at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At that time, 66% of eligible people voted.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents spread by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with a raised head, not a back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "yes" vote was a "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV in a referendum on Sunday, 57% of respondents plan to vote.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beats the entire defence of Brighton and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defence home on Saturday in a 2–0 game for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with the introduction in the middle of the court to the Argentine attacker.
The player overtook the three defenders of Brighton.
Then Aguero was among the four players of Brighton.
First he grabbed one of them, and then he outperformed the others and found himself on the edge of the Brighton penitentiary.
He then played the ball to the left where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero is dealing with a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who secured the blue lead in the Premier League.
The goal in question fell in the 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great tip along the left side of the court to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant pillar.
The Manchester City striker pointed the ball to the net just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing his chances to play in the playoffs by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to appear in the first line-up.
However, a fan of the Scherzer competition is hoping to play in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies have a chance to play in the playoffs. Currently the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win a Friday game against the Nationals with a 5:2 score. However, they still want to get their first division title.
“Although we’re playing ‘for nothing’, at least we’re going to get on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why would I not want to participate in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the launch thrower for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards exposing Scherzer in the first line-up.
This would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first line-up. The player took part in Thursday's kick-off training and is hoping to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed thrower of the Washington team scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated 300 times and finished 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So, Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the mid-term presidential election.
“In November, we’re putting all the achievements so far in jeopardy.
From one of the most important choices in our lives, we are separated by five weeks.
Although I’m not starting, I’m still very active. I’m constantly defending our great candidates,” he said.
He went on to say: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to seize power by all possible means, they are wicked and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal, but we won't give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats carry out the mission of “resisting and hindering activity.”
“It has been very good to see this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, malicious, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein’s name, which happened with a loud buzz from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
“Oh, am I listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerable to people expressing their own opinions.
When the activists of the Momentum organization in my party voted to give me reprimands, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of the Group of Members of the Labour Party, who have recently been told that they are not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has faced similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand stemmed from a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
The announcement on Friday of the Labour MPs’ meeting in Nottingham East County read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
For eight years of my tenure as Labour Party member, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place in a different way, and the promise of a "more cordial and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is assessed for compliance with the party leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over as chairman. Colleagues who seemed to me to have similar views began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not agree with one of the EU's earlier. They were concerned with such issues as
After every public speech, regardless of content, I meet on social media with attacks calling for the removal of nominations, the condemnation of centrism, or the departure of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily treatment in a sexist or racist way, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is the transition to the agenda with insults to others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for the “vote of distrust” and every change in the rules of choice, the worldview of the party is narrowed.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to bend over and shut up about certain issues, and then everything would be “okay.”
But that is not why I was involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government that led to the disintegration of my school class, I have tried to ensure a better quality of public services for people in need – both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I have never concealed my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the county of Nottingham East knew my position and was aware of the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday’s proposal, I want to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the chairman of the Labour Party in the face of an approaching Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message I send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be of service to you. I promise that no threat of revoking the nomination or any of your immediate political goals will deter you from acting.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17 – invincible Ayr again up
Two late additions could have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of the Scottish Extraliga.
The team finished first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this outstanding defense and better use of chances led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could have been pleased with his underdogs.
“So far the matches have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We have to pay tribute to the Ayr players. They have taken better advantage of the opportunities that have arisen.”
Ayr came to the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson and Frazier Clim's promotion. However, a yellow card for Rory Hughes' scout, who came to the Glasgow Warriors team, allowed Melrose to equalize the score more when Jason Baggot caught the ball on the pitch.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking off a penalty kick just before the first half ended. He first gained a touchdown, and later took a chance on a raise, scoring a 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started well in the second half. The addition of Patrick Anderson increased by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the court on the relays. After the resumption, Ayr increased the lead after the imposition of Stafford McDowall and the elevation of the Clima.
In the following order, the team captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used his numbers: the addition with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for taking down the Climate without a ball. MacPherson got a patch on the back of an approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise, then again managed to raise the score just after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from a penalty shootout and allowed winger Gregor Henry to win the fifth installment for the host.
The star of the Still Game series begins a career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting a business in the gastronomy industry. It has recently been discovered that he has become the director of a company running restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular sitcom BBC. He performs and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphille.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series' history. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning a future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though Scottish Sun’s whistleblower suggested Kiernan was trying to engage in a “developing food industry” in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open its way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the vicinity of the naval base in La Paz.
From the public buildings, blue flags are blown.
The Navy’s ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the following motto: “The sea is ours by law.
“Recovering it is our duty.”
In the inaccessible Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive. It is like a dream of re-sailing the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. The people are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching a meeting of the International Court of Justice together. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia's claim and after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to access an independent state to negotiate a deal.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will face a controversial re-election fight next year, also hopes for a ruling on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favorable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would change little.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also stated that it would not affect the establishment of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean specialist in international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case "was not complicated".
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years could have distanced the country from its goal.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales’ relentless rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remnants of good will, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
In the case of the two countries, no ambassadors have been exchanged since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — was using the issue of access to the sea as an element of political play.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is a great opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea’s rulers say nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as they can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “frozen” that the lack of lifting sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously approaching the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for Kim-Trump’s second summit.
Parisian fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of large headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy, oversized headgear as part of their 2019 summer collection that dazzled style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats peaked on Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
The outstanding work of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered round flooding the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-decorated watermelons, a magician’s hat, and even pineapple—but they weren’t designed to heat the head.
Thom Browne also showed off a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had their mouths sewn and resembled more Hannibal Lecter’s style than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're in luck.
Observers of the styles predict that huge hats can end up in clothing stores.
The non-sized hats follow “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a 61 cm wide round that everyone was wearing – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was poured through social media, presented another great creation on the runway — a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and crowned with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, stylist of the stars, said: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer — because the designer has managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to use the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast of further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another man in a language that he understands, then it’s in his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages occupy the first place in the league rankings, with the highest dissertation rates occurring in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had a higher grade A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish also had an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language learning, as subjects to choose from, is conducted to the same extent as learning STEM subjects (strict science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills of candidates, according to the report.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for the start of a professional career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
A lifelong skill like learning a second language will provide a huge advantage in the future — no matter what career path you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language whose percentage of people using it was double-digit, i.e. 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language teaching is so important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a greater chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed — no matter what the future holds for them.
Currently, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great deal of choice, diversity and level.
That's just right.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers are finally looking forward to it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play Sunday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of ballots tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump-planned polls to take place next week, along with positions in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his abstention from a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming half-century government elections, as Republicans may be at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump’s election be held in West Virginia tonight, and where will you be able to watch it online?
So Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held today at 7:00 p.m., on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So, Trump’s election in West Virginia will be followed live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings of FBI Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as a planned week-long vote in the Senate.
However, the main objective of this series of electoral councils is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, President Trump’s five-seat campaign next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an important point on the president’s schedule that as the hottest season of the campaign approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” said Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to give his name.
Today’s poll at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in a month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Maintaining Hope for Victory in Sunday's Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging accelerator pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and most of all in such competitions as these.
So what does their momentum look like at this point?
“They led by six points, and now they’re only leading by four, so I think we have a little boost,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are still twelve to gain.
The Americans, however, as Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy models to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of scoring three points out of four.
Spieth is threatening in all areas and gives an example.
Screams all over his throat that were a sign of excitement became louder throughout his round, drowning a key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas scored two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
Eighteen holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and were not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that did not include bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players must be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal the potential victory of the European team at National Golf.
It would be best if they were playing at different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double on the front nine dug Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they would never get out of.
On Sunday, there's no one who can help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy change can happen in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has a passion for fighting that some, especially in the U.S., have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes leading in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with a score of 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
Inspired by the duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo led the pack, claiming two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, raising their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the insignificant American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make a loss.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points out of 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball format in a magnificent style, they defeated pumped out Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 score.
Woods, who was tired of two Saturday games, occasionally showed a glimpse of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka with a 2&1 result — occupying positions 1 and 3 respectively in the world rankings.
The European team, however, did not think of this pleasant, cool day in a field pushed south-west of Paris.
Three-time top-scorer Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup it happened that the team made a four-point loss, starting singles, although Furyka's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea is saying a “serious no” to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister said in a speech at the UN on Saturday that the failure to lift sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and a commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see any specific response from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances there is no talk of unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean grievances about Washington’s reluctance to adopt a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, his statement was likely to be significant because it did not refute a unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean people".
North Korea had expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also relied on calls to ease harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization in the first place’ and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even resisting signing the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The conviction that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the stigma of people who treat us ignorantly.
The problem, however, is that the failure to lift sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which he spoke about earlier this week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: "If South Korea were the party to denuclearization, and not the United States, then there was no such denuclearization impasse."
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from last year’s when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the United States is inevitable after a “Mr. Evil President” called a “Mr. Misb<0xC3><0xB3>ket” Trump (Mr. Kim’s bad President) himself.
This year at the UN forum, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea's "total destruction," praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and also said that until the North Korean defender was not harmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t set a time slot for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be continuous until we find full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, after which, within hours, North Korea condemned him for “making gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cares about are the security guarantees Trump has pledged in Singapore, and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on adequately long-term rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, aimed at tackling the growing macho culture of learning by “caffeine-powered midnight students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now that I’m in my final year of college?’
She stated that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
During the course, which took place for the first time this year, students are explained how good sleep-related habits help to achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said the course was set to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in the academy where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this will not cause an immediate change in the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “full-time science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Providing a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoiding weight gain, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of the course for the entire campus.
The next step according to him is to invite all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm that reminds them when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can disrupt the daily rhythm and lead to problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered once again during a departure fight at Livingston, when Dolly Menga's shot led to the defeat of Steven Gerrard's disassembled team, scoring 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to score their first win since their 4–1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, causing his team an eight-point difference from Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers squad showing no commitment did not look to improve.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston climbed to third – just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further trouble dealing with the head wound of line judge Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, leading Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same eleven-year-old Livingston, who took a point from the Hearts last week, being delighted at the way his well-trained team struggled at every turn against their opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but it was Livingston who did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first touchdown allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, playing as a defender, could only stay in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he owed a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell for each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers managed to shoot only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s 34-minute goal opening match may have been against the game’s course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put into it.
Again, the Rangers did not cope with a deep, permanent piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept calm, giving Menga a simple finish.
Gerrard did not pause and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent — the change almost immediately affected the winger who pitched the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, coming out of his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw the guests into the game exactly as they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long servings one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor did well in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow threw the game off the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a penalty when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze again.

And now the page from our publication “Sunday Morning” Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger’s counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “perceive” enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘perceive’ enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of the treatment.
This method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells was observed to have ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine works very well.”
HER2 “propels the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and large intestine cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells from patients and “learning” how to locate their cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of some type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diarrhea show on Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "inducted" into the studio during Saturday Night Live after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third track titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he made a speech against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist!’
If I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's statement was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've got me!
And then they say I have no way out," he said — the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Are you saying I have no way out?”, adding, “I’m going to put on a superman pilgrimage so you won’t be able to tell me what to do. You want the world to go forward?
Let's accept ourselves."
His words caused the audience to “spark” twice, and the members of the SNL team looked troubled, reports Variety. The person in the studio during these events: “There was a grave silence in the studio.”
West was invited to the program to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was intrigued by the performance of I Love It in the disguise of a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUS group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR BETTING THE MAFIA".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being herself and it’s absolutely great.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her ‘art’) who, I believe, accepts and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also free,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegation of attempted murder for stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in the Grodzky court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often causes young boys to think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that he feels “quite confident” in addressing the issue.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, looking at the problem we’re dealing with now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what are learned?
What does he learn on television and in the streets, what makes young boys start to think that they have to stand by a certain side in order to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It’s clear that not everything is fine with young men.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following year, saying he was “finished with the battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will be playing Sam Shepard’s “True West,” a story about the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose the best thing that has happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“On the plan, I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this multi-award-winning Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, an object of love interest to the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, according to the health service of this country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted sexually, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year on year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members has leaked data on Republican Party senators — a “dangerous lie” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had placed the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's so-called lawmakers' pages.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wing".
“Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a Waters team member, Hill said.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and is a 100 percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been breached as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and is a 100 percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This kind of denial is bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't be wrong.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the person making the charge.
He has to stay calm for that.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of manifesting excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican nominee in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s rough, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to justice for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Johnny English: Knockout: A Spy Parody with Weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in every new British-threaded film has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the action-comedy "Johnny English" series, which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the screens of the English cinema in 2011 with the film "John:
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, the perpetually astonishing, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has once again been given a license to party—his name and surname more than anything else signals that he is an elaborate, comical product intended for non-English-speaking audiences.
He is, of course, a stupid undercover agent who, despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-mystery man — Atkinson once played in the forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, in which he left behind chaos.
In the latest film in the Johnny English series, there are one or two moments worth noting.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by the blades of the rotor.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also "serious" movie brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — in my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and consistent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jasmine Fasola.
It has always been the case that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker breaks into the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the horror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a minor role.
This is the last drop in the prime minister’s bitter spell, which is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can, embodying the character of Theresa May, but the script does not give her the opportunity to develop.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a couple of nice gags while giving English espionage lessons.
English is summoned to Whitehall for a check-in, reconnecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man tied to a submarine commander — a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's party in the secret service of Her Royal Highness return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems — it’s the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on a crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they wreak havoc by sneaking aboard the luxury yacht Volta; and English sows devastation while using a virtual reality kit to get acquainted with the interior of the house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and noisy performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
Typical average.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist thinking: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that envisages a four-day working week for Britons, for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering introducing a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a five-day paycheck.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to hand over to employees the savings made by the AI-related revolution, giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
The sources say that this idea will be “inscribed” in the party’s economic program and plans to leave the country against the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party member told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year.”
“This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Office, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their full share, as the Labour government could make “deductions” based on the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create integrated equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question of whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau of Investigation’s findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw them.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, who runs the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could change their attitudes.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Going to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened when that charge came up, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined and unequivocal.”
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be carved into stone.
“I have made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and a strong charge is needed to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who reported it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
Next Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held, an annual musical event that boasts an impressive cast of stars and an equally impressive mission – the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the most important goal of the 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless a VIP ticket was purchased), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant actions to help raise awareness.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “clickivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which pledged to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in that country, after two of the 47 global members said in a statement.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make social injustice, which is malnutrition, go down in history,” — Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, at a live concert in Lon
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which was "How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?",
The Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road — sometimes we’ll stumble and fail.
But as with the great civil rights movements of the past and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars performing at this year’s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to “block” Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
WASHINGTON may “if necessary” flee to its navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, by virtue of its navy, has the opportunity to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not hit the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is about using and replacing fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “one-trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration is continuing a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “slave” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the implementation of this project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the corrupt government, and that includes women in the highest office,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for president.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option “probably” said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp noted in relation to a potential 2020 candidacy were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) Track Palin During Donald Trump’s Voting Ceremony
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “a taboo topic,” after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little twisted, they come back hardened, they come back, wondering if they will be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other soldiers have done.”
He was arrested Monday in Washington, D.C., and charged with domestic violence against a woman, forcing a false testimony in a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon in a state of insanity, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Washington Police Department, said.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against a new policy on granting asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
U.S. prosecutors have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries struggling with widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades-old state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that policies denying immigrants entry harmed the U.S. economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and “make a necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on a racial, religious, national, or ethnic background, or because of belonging to a particular social group, or who have such and no other political beliefs,” Sessions said in its June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even the serious ones— that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, as the death toll doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fevered son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and arm, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to strong secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I've been pushed into the wall room," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “harassment” with propaganda advertisements.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. propaganda to the press.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily payroll in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new step in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post ads promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now escalating a trade war that has led to tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were expected to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “is now starting to harass with double force, putting propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, in the kiosk on the street in Beijing, there will be no voices of opposition and no true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the troubling economic direction chosen by China, given that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans insult each other ahead of midterm elections for women with voting rights over Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and gun the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, an analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with a violent backlash.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in a paper published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake’s efforts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation were enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it until November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is Coming,” protesting in the Senate Hall over the decision by Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony — as reported by Mic.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall – and that’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of sexual assault directed at a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could be met with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a lot of mess,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats vote.
However, Americans seem to be a bit divided about who to trust in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with the latter having a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimonials, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimonials.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied when making statements, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI began an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh under the influence of alcohol attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet in order to compete with the platforms Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is set to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform — Solid — belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt’s creation was “domination of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“The historic moment has come.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “personal data online store” or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology makers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that day by day will cause all their business models to turn upside down.
“Don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on Medium on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has done a lot in the debate on net neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the clergyman with the Victoria Cross during the First World War
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who during World War I was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never learning that he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on his grandfather’s centennial was “extraordinarily symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field units and machine guns".
He then hurried to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led it forward, after which he single-handedly attacked the position of the field units, eliminating three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never manage to meet, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to take part in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero manifests itself in the support he receives from many people.”
MMA fans won’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got Pig Peppa.
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the emotionally packed Bellator 206 gala and finally not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of program to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a children’s cartoon as “some sick joke.”
“According to the government regulation, this type of content is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepp's pig, yes."
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they are working on a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about the repetition of the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday morning at six o’clock, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were filled with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical fault.
But it wasn't a failure, it was just a legal issue.
I can promise that this situation will not happen again.
We’re going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much and unfortunately we did better.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Worse About Sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running program, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing on Laverne's first-ever show, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, this feeling of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “worth something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal activist of the LGBT community and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to express himself because he felt happy, being able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised” him.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he said, referring to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “it was difficult for him to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.”
The couple were the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept the fact that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing; it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew this was what I’ve been dreaming of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud performed by Heather Small — that accompanied him in his preparations for the Olympics and continues to spice him up with goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Demonstrating Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to work on his form to keep his heel off.
Mickelson, playing for the twelfth time in a biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day doping the team and working on improving his game in the hopes of fixing the cause of his referral to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest blows, even at the peak of his career, is not doing well on the tight Le Golf National field, where erroneous blows are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, he must face the precision of the British Open winner — Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches in Sunday’s ninth match.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with the wick, the Mickelson match can prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player — he probably couldn’t do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, knocked me on the back, took me by the hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the gallery of fame and has contributed a lot to the play of his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it happened and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws on his account. Furyk said that his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, laughable and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings much more to his person than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of the singles in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a game at Valderrama, where he had a five-point lead over the Americans with his accompanying vice-captain Seve Ballesteros, but he missed the finish line by the shortest possible hair, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We can’t forget that we had a big advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage on the Brookline field where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we only won by hair,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday, 6th and on Friday.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will do your best.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end will be only when points appear on the board.
We have a goal that is to win a trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
“I’ve said from the beginning that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are — the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is something else.
Tomorrow they start single, and that's a different matter.
It’s good to play with a partner when everything goes according to plan, but when you play alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
The message we have to give to the players is to give everything tomorrow.
Your partner has to do everything.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better in the singles than when playing with a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced major rebounds on the last day, being a member of the winning team at the Brookline field, after which he failed after the European team performed a "miracle at the Medinah field".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important matches — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, like you did at the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this push goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We set our composition accordingly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other players of the European team in the lead half.
“I chose this group of guys in that order because I think they’re going to make it through the whole game,” Bjorn said of his single choice.
Germany's new warship retarded
The latest German Navy frigate should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising media costs — as locals say.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the words of a military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the navy in 2014, but due to problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units commissioned by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, ensuring, among other things, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the operation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time the service begins.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key “software and hardware flaws” that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly significant, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, half less than for older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to carry out future modernizations.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the commissioning of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy "ends up ships capable of use."
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal of old units from service without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be included in the naval fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of batsmen
New research conducted on estates in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape when harvesting food.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these unique flying mammals and help guide future actions to protect them.
The research, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will involve common and small dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats from the family of reddish nights at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the estate, special recorders will be deployed to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequencies of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development works, which have an impact on settlements and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly glue and certain chemicals used in building materials and even domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It is made up of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, inspections and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson, the landlord of the estate, says that it is the ideal territory for batsmen.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before proceeding to carry out maintenance work on the estates, because the unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected —killing, harassing, or disturbing them, and destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape While His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday’s Der Spiegel reports, the footballer was to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were announced, described the news in a live Instagram message to his 142 million followers as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s news is fake news,” said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called “an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount of the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped a woman anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged attack and told her that in “99 percent he is a good guy” who was seduced by that “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she wants to nullify the deal now because she still can’t forget about the alleged operation.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer moved to Juventus after paying him 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘always regrets’ car manufacturers’ departure
The UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “concerned” when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC in an interview that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, production at the Burnaston factory near Derby will be temporarily suspended.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese carmaker said the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then there will be a production halt at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is planning to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern — as car manufacturers claim — the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal exit from the European Union by the UK.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
As a representative of the company said, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire, so production would be suspended.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan for future EU relations was “precisely constructed to avoid border controls.”
“We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy our current success, but also allow us to make the most of this situation,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers demonstrate that we need to be able to continue what was once a very efficient set of supply chains.”
The Toyota representative was unable to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the plant in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the board of the union organization Unite, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” due to the ongoing fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and potential impediments to the president’s justice system.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about wearing a wiretap to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was resigning.
A meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations, which further delayed a vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “No date has yet been set for this meeting, it may take place this week, and it may be postponed another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll definitely report it to the press.”
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The show’s host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences were not caused by a reluctance to “sensitivity” television journalists, then added: “I will not hide that they are “sensitivity”.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president conducts more Q&A sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without giving evidence: “We’re familiar with the numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this on a regular basis, and in the last few weeks we have been doing it very often, and press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which it will be possible to talk directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solitary press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, behaving too freely and sometimes strangely in front of assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to workers from European Union countries employed at NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to workers from European Union countries working in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for settlement status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union have continued in the summer, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the fall of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and streamline the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers striker Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores game, which ended in the team's 31-27 Tennessee loss, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
“He came to the sideline, then he leaned to the ground,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on a stretcher and brought him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet regarding the type/size of the injury,” and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student released from representing the university for a year to train his skills) plays his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match, he had five hits, which gives him 18 hits in the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax fee when buying a property in the UK
According to the new plans of tories buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to thwart the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions aimed at attracting a young electorate.
The tax increase will include people who do not conduct taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in homeless aid.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earning people.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and non-taxable businesses in the UK. Additional funds are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee —charged in addition to the current tax rate, including the higher rates for second homes and rented apartments introduced two years ago— can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions —especially the capital— have become “spirit cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut that would help young people buy their first home.
He accused major developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "housing scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of evictions “for no reason.”
It also wants to give local governments greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream of making the lives of every next generation better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our turbulent housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not okay that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy properties here with equal ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become very distant, so the humiliation associated with the need to sleep on the street remains even more real.
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to be Scotland's coach"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is working hard to heal the North-East club, which is currently third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after introducing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
but I managed to get only to the B squad," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“When I was a kid, I used to watch Scotland matches with my father in Hampden, and I’ve always been attracted to that.
But that will only happen if I succeed as the club’s coach.”
Ross's predecessors included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel shy by taking on the role of such prominent personalities in such a large club, rejecting previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success will be measured for me by whether I will be able to bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has at its disposal, there is no doubt that this is where it belongs,” he added.
“It’s not going to be easy, but I’m sure I’ll feel like I’ve been successful here, only if I succeed.”
Ross's coaching career lasted only three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa re-promote himself after degrading to the third league, and the following season led the St Mirren team from the edge of the line-up to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” Allo’s coach recalls.
“I really believed that leading a team is much better for me than playing it.
It sounds strange, because as a player, I managed well, I earned well and I achieved some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good in that role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and now I’m doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life.”

Research shows that the best time to drink beer is at 5.30pm on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a surge in customers to British pubs, but it rebounded with a tick on restaurant networks.
Studies have shown that in July, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continuously hot and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the July results to form similar to the June results, when the pub turnover increased by more than 2.8 percent.
The 1.8 percent drop in sales in restaurants in June was even more pronounced.
Drinking pubs and bars did by far the best — their sales growth outpaced the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars rose this month by 6.6 percent, while food sales fell by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for the entertainment and tourism industry, said: “These results are in line with the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the amount of consumption 'out-of-home' remain the weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dire consequences if you take into account the continued pressure to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of the premises serving food, and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much needed respite."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research has shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of pages of “fake Insta”
The news has heightened fears that there is sexual content published on it.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show to parents
One in five children —some as young as 11 — set up social media accounts that they don’t disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has heightened concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students admitted that they have a tampered “main” account, which they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenage girl who urged others to “rape” her.
A survey conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitted to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are creating their places on the internet where parents or teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics management, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most successful Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that introducing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased that I will be able to pass on the vote of the athletes to the Council, and I hope that I can really help manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now regularly appears in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I'm going to be able to recover and to what extent.
It was a torture job, but I was fully healed, I learned to walk again and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!”
A lactating advertisement that compares mothers to cows evokes extreme emotions on the Internet
A company that produces lactators has caused a storm on the internet, publishing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent underwear lactator,” its maker, Elvie, has released a mocking ad in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song in which you hear the words, "Yes, I know, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my boobs being replaced."
The chorus goes like this: “Pump them out, pump them out, feed the children, pump them out, pump them out, milk my ladies.”
The advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked a lot of controversy on the internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that is taking place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
“Like people, in order to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, except that their children are taken away from them a few days after birth.”
Elvie Lactator can be worn undetected under the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Of course, this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Of course, let’s use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their children.”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others defend the clip — one of the women said that in her opinion the song is "fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second bottom in it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who divert food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that the women danced with lactators discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
The Elvie lactator, however, is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be worn undetected under the bra for feeding, giving women the freedom to move, hold children on their hands, and even leave the house while pulling food away.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie Lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative premiere.
By combining breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with food withdrawal, while presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during Marta Jakubowski’s show, the mother of two children with this product was on the runway.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month does not really change. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most of the sponsors are also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they apply for a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in the joint farm would be taken fingerprints, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had filed as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees were not previously listed.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained — not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
A lot will be put up through video conferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for dismissal will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the easier they can become restless or get depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious in larger centers such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to overlook signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without providing them with adequate time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are staying on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “lead its holy battle until it purges the territory of Syria” from both terrorist groups and “all foreigners residing illegally on it.”
Currently, about 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French soldiers.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “raising irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the ruling party and the opposition soon to draft a draft of Syria’s post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the panel's work should be limited "to verify the provisions of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020, unless — as many liberal observers are hoping — his presidency ends with an early removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency to date.”
At the moment, there are no signs of tired viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of the largest audience, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast on MSNBC reached the highest results among cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers.
“People fly like moths into the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor, about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“It makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, prejudge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of reuniting immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen of Daniel Trump, when you watch a six-hour panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing the book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort’s jacket from the skin of an ostrich for $15,000.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again like I did before.
“What he’s doing is in part reminiscent of a reality show in that it delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily returns of Trump’s show (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim D’unaz).
You can't afford to miss the episode, because you'll have a backlog.
When I met Mike Fleisse this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He could not break away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just standing before the Senate Judiciary Commission and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing all these crazy programs before, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

The influx of money from outside for the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituencies, which has resulted in the race for one seat for two current congressmen, a river of cash flows into Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by a Democrat representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents former District 12 in Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new District 17.
The district maps were corrected after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, giving Republicans an advantage and was inconsistent with the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a fight to fund a campaign between the main funding bodies of the party — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a hair in the widely commented election to the 18th constituency, which took place in March.
Republicans have been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until his expulsion by the partners of the management team of the Trump Organization had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to end Taiwan’s recognition,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
The proposed sanctions, however, were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates, received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, among other things to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were intended to include restrictions on financial aid and visas for certain individuals, would be very grievous for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a possible step forward for the United States.
In mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to speak, which is to be a signal of an invitation to the meeting of representatives of the administration.
Three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, accompanied by no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, provided anonymity was provided, agreed to discuss internal bargaining.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst from the administration’s environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn about history
Another element may be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which specific evidence is now publicly available.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation also examines whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable as he prepares for a re-election speech, and may even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump — or people in positions equivalent to him in Europe — is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will decide how long it may take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points before the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he offered a covert recording of the president and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
And first of all, will we elect to Congress people in the middle of the presidential term who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light a squash candle on that table marked with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future optimistically?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is looking forward to a game against Rapid Wien.
The Rangers will take Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with the Austrians, achieved after an impressive rematch with Villareal achieved this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Group G of the European League.
Up to the 2:2 draw from Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes this result will work for the Rangers as a springboard for greater success.
“It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this match with the belief that we would achieve something — and we won the point.
Maybe in the end we could still push them, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to score three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent got a good result in his last match, but I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and win a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play. Training goes well.
I hope we can go further, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of Retirement Savings Spends Women Sleeping With Eyelids
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of participants said they had talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with the children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not talking about it,” said Holly Snyder, VP of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare a family to take care of yourself if you do not express your will beforehand.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay out cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent legal battles.
Appoint a trusted health care representative who will supervise it and ensure that the appropriate persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also, consider hiring an attorney who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is just going to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having that plan at hand.”
Man shot multiple times from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot from the windshield as he was returning home from an evening party.
He was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as an "accidental action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not endanger a man's life, and the police are asking for witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the broken communication, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupaten, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the kabupatent of Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, it was inhabited by 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its foundation.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which developed especially in the coastal kabupatent of Donggal.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, over the past 100 years, earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggal several times.
In 1938, the tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on the active seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, an earthquake of 6.8 degrees occurred, triggering a tsunami that broke into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the Sumatran coast, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Kabupaten Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the fatal 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police in order to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is under Mat-Su detention and has a $500 bail.
According to her, last Saturday he stood before the court, where in his defense he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three Class A offences on Palina, which means he can be fined up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, for which he faces a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of filing and possession of weapons in a state of insanity in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he acquired during his service in Iraq.
Hundreds Killed in Tsunami After Indonesian Earthquake
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday’s earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
U.S. Attorneys Demand Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he drove pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification filed in the southern New York district of the intention to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges threaten the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury court presented Saipov with an indictment that included 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in illegal activity — a procedure typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases — and counts of violence and assault.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection." The way in which Saipov conducted it, they described as "atrocious, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferruchi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dam<0xC3><0xA1>n Pag<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Five of the victims were Argentinian nationals who were staying in New York for tourism.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the southern district of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, in the months after the attack showed no remorse.
Police say he told investigators that he feels good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to authorities that the attack was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hung in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 counts, says he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors who represent Saipov, said they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after being convicted will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all concerned," he said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tories MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tories conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel hot” from eurosceptics when one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested she should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage were Brexit secretary, “the UK would already be outside the Union.”
However, the inclusion of Tories who choose to remain in the community in a separate protest against Brexit held in the city has further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks in front of Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies say that despite the opposition, it will seek to reach a deal with Brussels and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its proposal and “chaos.”
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave assembly in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of the Chequers.”
He suggested that Nigel Farage, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels, should become deputy.
“If he was the one doing it, we would be outside the Union now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in the world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their mind since the 2016 vote: “Thinking that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party, who supported Brexit, told reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who populate the streets and who elected us do not support it.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “Prime Ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said that politicians participating in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
Turning to the angry crowd, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel warm.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved “Torysi v. Brexit” banners after forming the group this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the party’s application security issues at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus Plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to “seriously consider” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is currently said that in the 2020 election, Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government — and she means a woman at the top.”
Arrest of the shooter in which LSU player Wayde Sims was killed
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday’s shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released asking for help in identifying the man visible on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm, resulting in his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games, starting 10 times last season, spending an average of 17.4 minutes in the park, scoring 5.6 points and collecting 2.9 points per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's command allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s command would have a big impact on the result of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the pellet tail, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rider went into boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after a double move of the opponent aiming to defend the position on the third lap.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
He then drove through much of the race thanks to the fact that he did not change the tires in order to make a quick finish and take away Kimi Raikkonen from the fourth position.
He finally made it to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the other eight lap he was no longer able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and proved to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump sneered at Senator Dianna Feinstein, who claimed she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony of Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “evil, malicious, and lying.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for several days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, malicious and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it to her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we disclose...No, we did not disclose,” he added, introducing the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me for discretion and as she requested, I did not disclose the contents.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during Saturday's meeting: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court judge, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
“You see, they don’t care who they hurt, they don’t care who they have to destroy in order to take over power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
Dundee Stars retaliated for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday, winning a 5-3 home rematch on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-door lead after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard again equalized the result, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who, despite the initial loss on Friday night, won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season — the Giants won their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendal McFaull's assist. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first third.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the goal scored during the game in a 27:37 minute lead.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure Dundee's first advantage in this match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who have lost four games in their last five matches, will play the next match at their home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Kills, Helping Hundreds of People on Plane to Escape Earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was dubbed a hero after he died, helping to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been identified as missing after a major earthquake hit Indonesia’s Celebes island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
In the area, strong secondary shocks are still felt. In the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in debris.
Although his colleagues fled while saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swaying flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Juffri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision likely saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands. The National Disaster Reduction Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death is still increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Six-metre tsunami waves destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.
“Small shops are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, who appealed to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Micronesia plane crash — Air Niugini lines report one person missing after plane crashed in lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, report that one person is missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to the data on Saturday afternoon could not count one man who was traveling in a feral plane.
They said they, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
Airlines said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the accident, nor is the exact course of the accident known.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to pass through the water reaching the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue operation was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby on the modernization of the coast. With the help of a blown boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in plane crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but there is no Air Niugini among them.
Analyst reconstructs the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office completed the presentation of evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for many hours as a forensic expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how using cell phone records he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the feral evening.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was reportedly supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
Asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he replied that “he was lying because my truck was in Nashville then.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis had her contact details, text messages and calls removed from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it is likely that the case will be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed – What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today’s hip-hop has departed from the original political content and social issues.
The members of the band want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
Nanny from New York sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for dismissing her from work on a racist background after receiving a misdirected text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail”.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly stunned when it turned out that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who had been putting on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, COLLEGE BLACK PERSON,” she texted her husband.
However, instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the act, she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that the warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, had performed her duties poorly and expected the Filipinos to do so.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by Uber.
She is now seeking compensation from a couple for the $350 per day redundancy multiplied by the six months she was originally employed as a resident, though she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of the cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified, because after being insulted, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Post’s husband, Joel Plasco, said.
“Would you entrust your children to a person you made sad, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on. Come on.
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
This is not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case in court is not over yet, public opinion quickly issued a couple of verdicts on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that publishers of books about Paddington feared that readers would not feel a connection with a talking missionary
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book is published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who, before the little plush bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book seems "sweet-bitter".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he adds.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was seen in a more or less similar way.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t get out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to maintain the action of the heart slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She died some time earlier and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that everything was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of what suffering she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an all-encompassing sympathy for Nada.
I felt that I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning are meant to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, try to seduce others from the intention of taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he fell ill with depression, and at the age of 18, he took his own life.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could light up every room with it.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created the cards, “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt pinched, sad or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was already in a complete hole. When the children opened the presents, he even looked at them."
She says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It’s digging a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in Italian because the FBI is launching an investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could reach some unanimity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “break up” into opposing camps, leading to an impeachment.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
Elections to Congress are in a few weeks — November 6 — and if Republicans are expected to lose them, the chances of electing a particular person to the country’s highest court will decrease significantly.
George W. Bush had already raised his headphones to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
In the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will be held.
It's not clear if Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senatorial votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 escapees and in 2011 there were 2,706.
According to him, the key factors that have influenced this situation are more detailed checks on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human traffickers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean fugitives are ultimately offered citizenship of South Korea.
According to authorities in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the tightly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on denuclearization negotiations, which had previously been deadlocked.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, the fruit of which is a general agreement to seek to clean up the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lacking progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and in these circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and claims he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and said he was by nature not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke during an interview she gave at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
“I think if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered a ‘hysteric’,” she told Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Moments during his opening speech Kavanaugh showed strong emotions—almost screaming and losing his speech as he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also blatantly haunted Democrats on the committee, citing the accusations he faced of a “grotesque and coordinated reputational attack” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it exposed his prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was nominated and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but he should also serve in the court where he’s currently working,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she feared Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the affirmative hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to bring a hysterical, preconceived person into court who will expect us to say ‘it’s wonderful too,’” Pelosi added.
And women have to control it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of pouring fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
“That’s quite common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cries when she’s angry, but she came up with a way that when she gets upset and starts crying, she says to the person she’s talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because she’s crying.
I'm angry.
He's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are acceptable as an outlet of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of the first jobs in a male-dominated office is how one day I started crying with inexpressible rage. An elderly woman — a cool driver, who I was always a little afraid of — grabbed me by the neck and carried me out.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they've burned you."

In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat named Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated to the limit Patricia realized she could actually consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder had a backlog in fundraising and promised herself that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only $250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she asked.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — gratitude to those who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and appeal to voters, not to delegates, and in the sexist way.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” the press reports.
“You might think I’m sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
"Crying?"
What are the benefits of Beijing’s economic war between the United States and China?
The ointments initiating an economic war between the US and China have been deafening, and while the battle is still ongoing, in the long run the conflict between these countries could be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which resulted in half of all goods entering the US from China being taxed.
Each time, Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. blow, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second-largest economy is about to fall.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would mean accepting the demands, but a public head-turning in front of the United States would be too annoying for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure resulting from the trade war with the US could strengthen China in the long run, reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the unleashing of economic chaos in some of the countries is actually far more dangerous than the observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for American Security think tank.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says It's 'Ready' for Refugees to Return
The government claims that Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country destroyed as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
“The situation in our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
The next six million people who still live there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid provided under conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
In Europe, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not do well during most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th hole PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the rounds and became one of four players who since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a 5&4 result by the lowest ranked player in Europe, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who occupies the highest position in the world rankings, lost two holes before the last hole with England's Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the highest number of wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It is the success of the whole team and I am happy that I was able to help," Garcia said after the victory of the team from Europe.
He hands the baton to his native, John Rahm, who beat single-handed U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2&1 score on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and only outranked Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the track all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American squad, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pushed a few Europeans.
We're back.
Head hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.”
Flowering information — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota plankton density decreases
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton densification in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of pstrocate bloom has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its thickening is decreasing.
It stretches for about 209 kilometres along the coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
Flowers can be found about 16 kilometers off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
Flowering was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, an average concentration of plankton was recorded at the coast and in the waters of Pinellas County, low to medium at the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high at the coast and in the waters of the Sarasota County.
