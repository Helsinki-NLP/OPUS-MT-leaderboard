Accumulated incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries with that of Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Covid-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on January 24, 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the COVID-19 case counts reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to that of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries showed similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is true despite the different stages in which countries find themselves, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios related to saturation of health care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalisation cases associated with a risk >90% of overcapacity for intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, conglomerates of cases have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the UN-2 Nomenclature of Units.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation one, as the rapid expected increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to agree on how to understand, accept and adapt their response.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research topic, which is rapidly developing.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still do not have an answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; that’s why, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1” and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report of January 7, 2020, which determined the isolated virus sequence of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress in research on this new and rapidly developing subject.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered twice highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection from health care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical trial on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, there were 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization prior to China’s Spring Festival.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain one-way chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which the alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The envelope's spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusi<0xC3><0xB3>n occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electron cryomicroscopy structure in 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution, in complex with transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Intermediate Guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21-like SARS-like coronaviruses.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to clarify the transmission pathway.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, implying homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-mouthed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective at deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been announced.
Accordingly, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Co-operative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence in conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large amount of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; it is in this way that asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest mortality of MERS relative to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and elevated to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than those of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital may re-contract the virus, an alarm signal that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver and muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte counts were progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in ground glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of pneumocytes type I and type II decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Accordingly, the worst findings on chest X-rays are often parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the scaling of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitial, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of SARS and similar viral infection.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l complexes using a less than one var.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include treatments in current or potential use with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs expressing ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Accordingly, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are T-cell-directed immune response modulation; blocking IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, specifically osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses for a short period of time has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
To date, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19 has been established.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is high expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and generation of antibodies
Taking blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for use on a large scale until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly resulting in fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main rates of recovery in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19.
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (MO) treatment only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were noticeably shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCTs are still awaiting more well-controlled trials at larger scales and at more centers.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 usually have a lot of fear of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who are in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to disrupt the transmission chain from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate powerful, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older adults and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died out 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably greater than those who did not require them (with an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/10 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are most likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, an elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's progress.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest x-rays and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as happens with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it enormously difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was mostly not in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing notable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowing of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical influenza-like episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by infections in nosocomia, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passersby in contact with infected patients or people.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the liquid droplets of a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or adhered to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear tailored isolation robes in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective faces or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more followed than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus to the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it wasn’t until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems preventing and containing the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the public’s alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and was wasted the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as each word matters to the public and can cause them to change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early phase; and (4) more effective to implement it in the early stages.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which generates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, the bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to brake the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it go extinct like SARS, or will it periodically resurface like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to look for answers to these questions and many others.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also yield important information about the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with an emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on interspecies transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of envelope-positive single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" because of their morphology, because of the corona form they have under an electron microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polyproteins replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of accessory proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the gene source for most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (AHRS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion from patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a raw lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later dubbed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and species-cross-jump constraints.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which would have important implications in preventing spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronavirus parent viruses are not usually pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also looked at the trend in the evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility often leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from nasal secretion from patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow on WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10–20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial pass in brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated levels of creatine kinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also seen in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe respiratory disease in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit themselves efficiently and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases are from the Middle East, cases have been reported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which retrospectively were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and has also dubbed the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside of it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which presents as fever, cough, and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to an 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between that of SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are most commonly seen in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly smaller.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmittance of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to check whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages between humans, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fulfills an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be clarified in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human-to-human passages, will have an influence on the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious illnesses in humans and humans that developed serious illnesses by human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as the evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus on an ongoing and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become infected naturally and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the function of amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
The epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had had contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Civets from masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, civets from wild or farm masked palms without exposure to live animal markets were reported to be mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that civets from masked palms would only act as an intermediate host amplifier, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV amplification cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat HKU3 CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive on anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 obtained from a faecal sample of bats was shown to use the ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, serums from patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences of MERS-CoV phylogenetically approach their bat beta-coronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as do camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only respiratoryly, but also fecal-oral, which is also the main route of spreading bat viruses.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no prior history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or to unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future virtually identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses.
The genomes of this novel pangolin coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study in diseased pangolins also reported detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which are found to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal advocates a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mount Coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to have a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-species coronavirus transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of species-to-species transmission of HCoV-229E is not known so accurately.
Alpha-coronaviruses of bats have been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-coronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-coronaviruses are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coronavirus of alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha-coronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising that bats would transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-coronaviruses act as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of species-to-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a large collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal “virus spreader.”
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, who have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reservoir guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses, such as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the killing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a reading-checking exorribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress coronavirus replication by inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, which promotes the emergence of new coronaviruses when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is backed up by copious unique open reading frames and functions of proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change often occurs during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomics could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In the present case, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human SARS-CoV and civet strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon, allowing transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human viruses and civets in the RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S protein S1 unit implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptor may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different portion of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restrictive factors in order for species-to-species transmission to be successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective full genome investigation of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be useful.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: we start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but they were determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29 nucleotide elimination characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma coronavirus strains, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were also identified.
Similarly, it has been shown that epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to undesired changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a removal of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-coronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the higher histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without eliciting a strong immune response from the host.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of disengagement from the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflamasoma with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The onset of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the onset of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses have been found to be remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets that were in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-coronavirus strains of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures, should be adopted.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, opportunities for humans to contact bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it’s a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are nearly identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be met if no clear epidemiological background is available:
epidemiological background: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2; or (2) a history of contact with anecdotal nucleic acid;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts in the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some characteristic of either pathogenic or serological testing for co-Rs or co-Rs as follows: (1) real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome showing high homogeneity to the recognized novel co-Rs; (3) positive result for co-Rs antibody I and co-Rs.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number in a day
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying at their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, it was two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than 1 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m. European Central Time (UTC-0800) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the one-package limit.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reportedly stocking up for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packets per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, “many supermarkets still deplete the product within one hour of delivery,” and said the lawsuit “had no precedent,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose "strongly" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional inventories, while ALDI made inventories available for a special Wednesday offer scheduled in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local town hall restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It envisions an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make Wednesday’s special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stock up every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a voluminous item, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a large empty space in the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that [if] there was an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be [purchased] and there were large amounts, it would probably minimize panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that they ran out of stocks.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page paper designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets initially were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the magnitude of a disease’s spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO highlighted the need to urge governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic “has no precedent.”
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "Beyond influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic condition comes after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, “in conclusion, it’s going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people, and controlling and self-isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of viruses.
Due to the reduction of travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, therefore, the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to have symptoms was infected with SARS-CoV on December 1, 2019.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old from Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, there were first cases decreased in China but new cases suddenly increased out of China, in Italy, Iran and Korea.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the UK population would have to become infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had performed tests on more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not performing tests on people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, most often being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were from people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died positive in the COVID test, according to the official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without the test may not be included, for example, in their homes, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimation," a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. This underestimation is common in pandemics, such as H1 gricans.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Generally, various indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex, and overall health.The proportion of deaths per case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths per case is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with the onset of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with the onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the death rate per case, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who died due to the disease, and the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who died due to the disease.
These statistics do not have a set time frame and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the death rate from pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on estimates of the death rate per case.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But right now, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, China’s top medical adviser, said it could “end in June” if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, since it's so easily transmitted, will go away completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (flame), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish color on the face or lips; before the manifestation of these symptoms, severe illness is recommended, immediate medical care may be required.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting with clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to closely monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by talking. Breathing droplets can also occur during exhalation, even when talking, although, usually, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, therefore, aerial propagation.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through the stool, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact-tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that, while it is not completely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two or three others.The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature-related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies by coming into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus beta-coronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the full genome comparison indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, although ultimately confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by CT imaging.
According to a Wuhan study comparing the polymerase chain reaction with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computed tomography as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for its widespread use to be approved.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glazed glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without confirmation by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and with computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the phase of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for transgenic and transgenic authorities to determine.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. They are circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal rinsing and mouthwash gargling are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed at a facility, such as an office or daycare facility, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable coughing or sneezing handkerchief, and dispose of the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance traveled by the respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency [to] touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in busy places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask while in public spaces in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on trains and intercity buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of outdoor masks, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding busy areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany virtually banned the public meetings of more than two people. The elderly and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends the health care to stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-isolation, and many Governments have demanded or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those who belong to the high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include serious personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures oriented to physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass concurrence events; the community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and the community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise the transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are flexibly taken.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO’s Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible by increasing the available amount, separating and isolating care from COVID-19-positive patients, and increasing capacity.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) might have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed in Jihan Province, which was in charge of Dr. Ji. Zhangxi's Hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for sounding the alarm.
Subsequently, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO.
At the beginning of January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration by the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway crossing.
On Jan. 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as home stay orders, 59 million on-site shelter orders or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of confinement in the United States, Filipinas are in more than 50 million people are in trust.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some kind of confinement, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital informed the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, police warned doctors in Wuhan for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 that banned travel in and out of Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the issuance of health declarations for travelers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was changed and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outlets. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. By March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, this time through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
The same day, travel restrictions in Hubei as well as in Wuhan were relaxed, two months after the lockdown was imposed. On March 26, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details as to when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for the signatures. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that will begin with a moment of national silence of three minutes on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked the families to meet the deadline to present their answers.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, out of 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best-organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as to identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newcomers from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test on up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korea’s society was initially polarized with respect to President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon’s dismissal for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad must remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 billion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a hub for spreading the virus after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had tracked their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in testing for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 Iranian expatriates or politicians in exercise had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be lifted for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country while Italy was hitting 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the discontinuation of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and most of those cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy’s combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced the necessary social distancing measures and stricter restrictions, which prohibited the gathering of people.
Unlike previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government’s failure to approve non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (after a medical order is required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On the other hand, China’s assistance was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa, and on April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
The WHO pointed out the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays."
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, it was reported that the first IBD in China, the representative of the WHO Gauden Galea noted that, although "it was definitely not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it was not the precedent in the history of public health".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was “at risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems.”
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries “that do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if there are any.”
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that United Nations Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to contribute “the power of the entire United Nations system in response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to address the broader social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was launched to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmittance of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, warned in a statement that “This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared,” insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that “we are basically accepting that all humans on the planet will be exposed to that virus.”
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction."WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized that the rights of all people are respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts indicated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level Chinese Communist Party (CCP) administrators were fired because of their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected a previous recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and claimed that "China's censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distracting management of its failure".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a ploy of communications with apparent origins in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All About China."
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union’s foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and a policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own countries.
And disputes related to masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" who claimed that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
Lombardy’s president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medically-assisted cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
NATO’s planned military exercise “Defend 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it puts at risk not only the lives of the troops of the United States and the different European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, saying his country is having difficulty combating the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand for universal health care, universal health care, and universal health care.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively impact Donald Trump’s re-election prospects in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the ouster of Moon for what they considered a mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule indefinitely by decree, suspend parliament and elections, and sanction those deemed to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions to logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and vendor disruption.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
Measures by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy, there are similar laws that require food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 report, China’s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Given that mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of considerable destabilization to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly “reversed” after a sharp fall in oil prices due to lower Chinese demand.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow fell 1191 points, the biggest fall in a day since the financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with more than 10% declines.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the basis of fears about the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation by governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in care times or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 percent drop.
This also caused a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian transit to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic situation could leave between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate in 2020 could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the survey of the Angus Reid Institute, the unemployment rate in Canada was 9 percent.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations sought to carry out their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that is increasing at an accelerated pace of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Lent Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet broadcast or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter’s Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "reschedule for a later date than 2020 but not after the summer of 2021".
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their rates of new enrollments. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world that the Chinese either deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and off the Internet.
After the outbreak moved to new countries where the situation is critical, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve a ban on Chinese entry to their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the UK and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, in addition to aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, were harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "erroneous". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic increased, and foreigners were described as "foreign trash" and destined for "waste".
Many paid-for-wall newspapers removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted tests on more than 3 per cent of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests conducted in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting reported death rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysops or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hyssops is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Afterwards, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways using a suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of the clinical grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Recovers the "E" gene shared by all the betacoronaviruses and the 2019 RdRp gene specific for SARS-CoV-2 coroners. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the National Administration of Medical Products of China of a detection kit of SARS-CoV-2 coroners based on SARS-CoV-2 coronerase chain reaction and in the United States.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated unconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a stalemate in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based COVID-19 testing.
Similarly, as of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Care Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approximately time machine approval for a test that could be carried out in a 24-hour timeframe that allowed for a large-scale testing.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (protein N) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it can quickly deliver the same results in 15 days.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that “thoracic x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobe opacities in glazed glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, it develops subpleural domain, pattern in stoning and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computed tomography as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system’s reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. They can be performed in central laboratories or by tests at the point of care.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analyses in central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to track the immune response.
For point-of-care tests, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a puncture on the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed before analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test performance is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it purchased were good enough to use, and the UK found that the test kits were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, the emergency department takes care of them, the emergency department takes care of them, gives them a tube for specimen, the patient spits in the tube, sends them and gets a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze the suspicious cases in their homes.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that tests had been done on 10,700 people the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-through testing was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first survey of laboratories showed that, at the natural week of 12/2020, a total of 10 samples were tested positive for the test, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital tested positive for the test.
With the construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample-preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for more testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection testing per person at its population level, and was on track to increase the testing to any other country.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capability and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States was not available until January 28, which delayed the tests available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the testing kits sufficient to meet the requirements at the beginning of the outbreak.
On the contrary, experts say South Korea’s high availability of evidence has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to reduce the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hyssops and chemical agonists.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that it would not be
The testing, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of people with whom they had had contact who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests across the population of about 3,400 inhabitants, about ten days apart.
About half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began recommending residents to stay at their homes, but schools reopened in time after the holiday of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have conducted the most tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower death rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only performs tests on people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as a percentage of tests than a country that performs tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing your hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before and before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no soap or water is available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After your nose sounds, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medications or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced with the introduction of simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, and the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing nearly half of deaths from diarrhea and a quarter of deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin scaly known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral-faecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (urinate, defecate), after cleaning a child’s tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or meat.
Other occasions when a proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or nosing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, women in developing countries practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest handwashing rate with 23%, currently.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective for cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been intensively promoted for a health-conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting bacterium, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulators, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Nice warm water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents with no water and alcohol to rub (also known as alcohol-based hand rub, antiseptic hand rub or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a wetting agent such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants remove bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used to rub, moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands before hand sanitizers to rub, especially when your hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid microorganism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless water or soap is available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin, unless emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand rub solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers largely depends on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rub solutions.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Constrict for at least 20 seconds.
Tightening creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and squeezing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinsing in a container can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent your hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no running water or soap is available, for example, pouring water from a hanging canister or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if needed in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar from a rope and a lever driven with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
More and more research is pointing out that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry association, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and by 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air-jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine if there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bath users and the bath environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, it is claimed, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacteria count were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when you do not have water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The washing of doctors' hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors’ hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together intertwining the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a bristle brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated by those surfaces again.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on their website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before an aseptic job and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (soaps "medicinal" or "antibacterial") gives the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine to be rinsed and rubbed for washing hands.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after treating sick people.
To control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand washing is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of foodborne bacterial infections compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the anti-rubbing with alcohol did not contaminate 26 % of the anti-bacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and spores of Clostridium difficile from the hands than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on handwashing, and increasing personal alcohol availability from handwashing to disinfecting.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing taps near public or private toilets, although there are economical options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing can also be the result of ingrained habits and not the lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and cause a change in behavior in the population over the long term.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star” approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective hand-washing measures to ensure that their children’s needs are met.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to finally three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF spurred the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to AVAD avoided.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the modern Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Night.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health care-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct handwashing techniques" were hung next to the toilets of public toilets and bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “wash your hands” is a statement of not wanting to take charge of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and which she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value items for hand washing more.
In addition, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleaning” actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for particular hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, such as Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD>sm, Hinduism, Tevil<0xC3><0xA1> and lavat yadayim in Judaism.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force you to wash your hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force you to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
The workplace risk controls against COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommending workers to stay at home with a cold if they are sick, and norms.
Work with average exposure risk includes those requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, high-concentration work environments and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, caring for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are claimed and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at non-peak hours, through home delivery services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be disrupted, and a preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at greatest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational health and safety framework to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, frequently checked, serviced, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards including covering when coughing and sneezing, the provision of paper tissues and waste disposal containers, the preparation of waste disposal and waste disposal, the preparation of waste disposal and waste disposal, the provision of waste disposal and waste disposal equipment, the provision of waste disposal and waste disposal equipment and waste disposal equipment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a critical measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay in their homes until they stop having a fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without having taken medications to relieve the symptoms or decrease the fever.
According to OSHA, work with medium exposure risk includes those that require frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community-based transmission of the time around the company's location, or because the person generally made an international trip.
These include the staff that are in contact with the general public, as in the schools, the work environments with a lot of concentration of people and some environments of retail sale of large size. The engineering controls for this group and the groups at greater risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the staff that is in contact with the staff, the staff that is in contact with the staff, the staff that is in contact with the staff, the staff that is in contact with the staff.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a paper mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth or nose.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Disposable gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected subsequently. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other passenger-carrying vessels, the risk controls include postponing the journey for illness, self-isolation or inbreeding.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends the short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing space between the desks, escalating entry and exit times, limiting visits to non-essential children and using a separate room.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For law enforcement personnel carrying out routine daily activities, the CDC considers that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are advised to contact people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before re-using them and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the high-risk exposure jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected diagnoses of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue work of exposure includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these go on to have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering checks for those at-risk groups are confirmedV for those at-risk rooms.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be suitable in some healthcare settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have had SAVs.
In the United States, N95 filtration masked respirators approved by NIOSH or above must be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training, and medical exams.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of incoming patients.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them, or transport them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face protectors, robes, and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of permission to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19, while providing only those people involved in their direct care, the use of the same equipment without masking.

This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our human interconnection globally and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all of our peers in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky to work with are.
I couldn’t feel any greater gratitude and pride that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping sites running, helping our peers receive their payment, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not have to be said, we say it.
There’s no need to ask for sick leave or paid free time; just report to your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, of T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our hourly contractors and co-workers.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is about your personal care.
What we ask is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
The teams of Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “double the hours to catch up” when the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will communicate the next steps to the delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located at a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members at DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with shared guidelines with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely from before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Define the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video use by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and speaker list, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your peers about distributed work
The HR Operations team is analysing guidelines on ergonomics based on webinars to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week, we’ve asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We would like to inform you that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to comply with any of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
This week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness at the interruption and, in part, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining Contact in Relation to COVID-19 Issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, Coordinated Universal Time/07:00 h, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can still find the information from this email and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything you might need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and act as a link when needed.
If you have sensitive or sensitive issues, send an email to Bryan Judan, RR. HH’s Director of International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations are likely to have to adapt in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and therefore we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can be in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of M2 peptidase and a C-terminal domain of renal colectrin amino acid transporter.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
mRNA expression of ECA2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract ECA.
ACE excretes the hormone angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaves the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-O-Ile-H).
ECA2 can also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradyquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 determined that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular, those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as strong for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is high. rhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for treatment.
COVID-19 applications are mobile device software applications designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government backing in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, in particular in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source app and will be ceded to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetering app for patients living in Moscow who have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they don’t leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible inefficiency if application adoption is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about spreading misleading or harmful “coronavirus” apps, Apple has limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations presented a statement to demand limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensive monitoring and surveillance would have to have extinguishing clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used, rather than apps, which eliminated both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to conduct contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate alerts via text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research going back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporal contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CENs, and protocols for contacting and tracking.
In these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report “Apps Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for achieving broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reprofiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate by an emergency use authorization (U.S.).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under a U.S. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has arisen about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple phyloviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance by mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two led by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with a moderate illness and another for those with a more severe illness.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are underway for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial with Alvesco (cyclesonide) from Teijin, an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin converting enzyme form 2, a phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, breastfeeding women or women who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicentre study with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Here are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical coronavirus vaccine 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect there to be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, CEPI’s initiative requirements for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale-up implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Among the targets of the main platforms that switched to phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumably being planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary tests of safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and performed at multiple sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not being evaluated in humans (continued in the “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly-suppressed vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with similar technology to that used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were beginning tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, while progressing rapidly, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a partially funded, coronavirus-like particle from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,” to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
The possible BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a COVID-19 vaccine that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of USD 29 million to the COPI for development.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA received two weeks-long potent antibody responses (MNA-specific antibody responses).
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines with COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic mice expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide, and there is no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) SROM vaccine completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, three were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spreading is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hyssopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they should not be used, others recommend that they should be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal drip, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1, out of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more droplets than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people’s bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through the stool, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spreading is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that while it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more.The virus survives for hours or days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after hospitalization began.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
Coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, homemade soap kills the virus, as it rolls over its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which is most abundant in the lungs’ type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called “spice” (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and are involved in their functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died of COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and infiltrates were detected in the inflamed lymphocytes.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by the epithelial cells expressing respiratory ECA2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T lymphocytes correlate with IL-6 secretory monocyte recruitment and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In the autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on samples of the airways obtained by a nasopharyngeal hyssop; however, samples of nasal hyssop or sputum may also be used.
Usually, the results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results are of very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain from the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use by the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular frosted glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered stoning pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to decrease the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and, if you don’t have tissues, use the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth caps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling crowded public meetings.
Distance guidelines also indicate that people should keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after sounding your nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available in a timely manner. For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis."
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend similar totamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent airborne transmission. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of equipment (e.g.
The recommended equipment is EPP coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators are preferred (instead of masks).
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an urgent use authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications is not guaranteed.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (those over the age of 60 and, in particular, those over the age of 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the health system’s ability to handle the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has Acute Respiratory Difficulty Syndrome (ARSD) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescent as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect “close contact” and thus a potential risk of infection by surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-containment, but also alerts local health officials. The analysis of cell phone information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summarized phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people are still moving."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and SROM, but COVID-19 data is insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to Water Respiratory Difficulty Syndrome (WRDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired coagulation, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation impairment, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas renal function impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the median time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples from the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to Acute Respiratory Difficulty Syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of disease mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity seems to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently tested positive for coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the death rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the death rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was a relatively low mortality rate, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been surpassed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is highest among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The biggest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only narrowed to 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations under the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common for the virus and disease to be referred to as "Wuhan coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local start-up performed reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information, and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease emerged that spread rapidly over the Internet.
It would seem that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, the researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, either inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection with the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge to the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adjusted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of China’s research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries, and are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was underway. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonafervir in combination.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians of COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial priming of the S protein performing transmembrane type 2 serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through E-receptor interaction.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It is found in a national non-randomized phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it is expected to counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomised controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified antibodies and concentrates produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
