It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old man.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, it wasn't me.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's gonna take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like he's studying you.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I speak to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna take advantage of it, Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them up.
How much is it worth?
The water was suffocating.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking backwards and forwards.
Tom picked up the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
It looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You've made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine, give it back.
The wolves tamed the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I like that tattoo a lot.
Get a card for your pocket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back later?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
And we'll meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When was the robbery?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he is trying to redeem himself.
Tom doesn't know how to turn around.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
The alcohol had an effect on him.
Dan decided to leave the city.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around at himself.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a little tingling in his cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have responded reluctantly.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit his mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go for a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we don't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop blaming him, Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later on.
Are you helping him?
Are you two related?
He likes a ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take the subway than take the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give his all?
Mary wrapped the film.
She's got a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary punched John in the face.
I've written Tom's reports.
Do they buy like that?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't mutter.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza so early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke in French.
He shaved off.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose swells every time I get cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Has anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me so badly in high school.
He wore a hat that was still worth the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get some help.
That’s what he wrote in the newspaper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're poor people.
You don't make a man with a mole.
She and she tried.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a chop.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also accept checks.
Newspapers cost a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verbic ways: expressed, conditioned, commanded, and transmitted.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her drawings like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is now a martyr.
Tom looked rabid.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
Why aren't you sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom snatched me from his mother's pussy.
I didn't have an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Does Tom think that's what happened?
The show has to continue.
Make a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't get any attention.
I almost fainted.
Choose your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're running out of gas.
Tom's a trawler.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Get me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Are we here to wait for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom has complained about is the food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in the slum bar.
Both of them coughed.
The train passed through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We weren't expecting them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they will try to escape.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still up to date.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
That's weird.
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a mess in his room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees, then why are you still alive?”
They smiled quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I gave him a slap.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are very important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
It was especially difficult for the king to keep speaking, because of the heavy speech mania.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him that Mary wasn't here.
It's too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It’s easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
I'm licking.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom's making Mary happy.
Tom's ruthless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by humanoids.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem too busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear my name?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Didn't you love the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie yourself up.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short dresses.
Can you please explain why?
You can stay in here.
Butty, Albert, your theory sucks.
We went bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least give me a little help?
I like the school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There’s no height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We've been discussing this.
Tom's got the ball.
Where's the nearest bank?
Let them call me.
A power grill warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary out.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Yesterday, we had a visit.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm getting out of the war.
In the forest, monkeys descended from the crustaceans.
Let's forget for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
He's got his sleeve on.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Shut up!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's darkening.
The pipes are clogged.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom accidentally told everyone I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I have no secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
You're gonna have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia really liked the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does anyone care about it?
How are you to blame for that?
Tom's beer from a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Does it bother you?
When does it start to show?
She sounds frustrated.
Tom's socks are ripped off.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cooky the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But he lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I offered it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold it!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It is a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's up to you to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the alley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom sat next to Mary.
I had a couple of auditions, but I didn't get a job.
It happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was going to panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go a little bit longer.
You should try this one.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom's in trouble.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom is in serious need of help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would've figured it out.
We were laughing at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was a faggot?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him that he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrots are a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a rough night for me.
Tom was driving through the city with a raised brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom's looking suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty bloated.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is also undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want a bowling alley?
I'm sorry, I think you missed something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed for months three times.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to exercise.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't worry about it.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What's that got to do with it?
We're finally seeing each other, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was cheering.
You're so nasty.
Did someone hit Tom?
There's a rule here.
Tom made his decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
Your coffee is giving you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big deal for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I’m afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's a good writer.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
She no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really annoyed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
You let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do it all.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
He made a promise.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There are a lot of birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's go on foot.
That's who I wanted to meet, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Maybe Tom's richer than we thought he was.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I contacted a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your tribe.
He's sorry.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicidal.
Hardwings, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light the fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom rubbed his knee.
Where do pineapples come from?
Can we talk up there?
It is made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I have a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom stepped in, and the crowd cheered.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize him as a typon.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a mister with bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be what it wants.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills a day.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking bowels.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to stop him from sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them one more chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure has taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father brought me here when I was young.
You're such a pussy.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to be quiet.
I'm hardened.
Tom's here early.
He was drying her wet clothes by the fire.
He is always fluent in his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have roofers?
None of the pigs are missing.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What will happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What's the use of that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn’t read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be crazy.
I can't open the bucket.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear that.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your lunch. I like your lunch.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How old is she now?
You understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted to get.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom licked the ice.
I'll never surrender.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first time I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Be careful!
Linda was bored, and she suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front door.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I will do as I know and can.
I got the money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's fixed up.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't be cockroaches.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a prostitution dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of murmur is the emotional murmur.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the seedling to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives in a foreign country.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary came into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't really look possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom was respectful of Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's in big trouble.
It's not blue, it's violet.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before the age of one, so they eat humans.
Could you pull the arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how much you knew how to be smart.
Can I see her?
He's wasting his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
Looks like I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
- Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Oh, come on.
The book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lied to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very badly muffled sounds. I hear him chewing mastic in the next room!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels do not keep us and do not lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn’t help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is the call.
Who saw me.
Tom's approaching.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did it come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are going crazy.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second of trying to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom shut his locker.
Maybe we're relatives.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Do you mind if I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell yours about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of his kids.
I asked him the same question.
We had to look for where to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six flaxseeds.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found the time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There's also people who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's getting dressed.
Tom threatened to kill Mary in the first place.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this have happened?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We've got to find him.
He used me.
That's too bad.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to sneeze?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Give up the bands.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was overflowing with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everybody here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we will eat cherries from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
Watch out, that's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on the shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
The evening suits me.
They were traveling eastwards.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramides that fell from the roof were scattered.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean up the tub.
Pass by anytime.
Tom would've kicked us out.
Tom is not ashamed.
I'm just finalizing the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You'd better go.
Tom drowned the exit.
I have two devices.
What did you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put down his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
Looks like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to say.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yell.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoebas are lifeless.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left him a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French word for “bubamara” is written.
The elevator can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Is that what you're doing?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask a professional person.
I love to travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to take over something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
I've been looking for blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you the first you.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Get a scarf, your nose's running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
Originally, they were farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm worried.
Tom seldom goes out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wouldn't rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camille would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom forbade me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary weren't talking to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pajamas and a bathing suit when I arrived on Saturday morning.
We've all read that.
Get over here.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
She was Mary’s first teacher.
There is a fountain in the city.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree obstructed the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom has a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Mathematics is the best thing for him.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the crocodile this morning?
He believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary that he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's futile.
Some fish know how to change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It forces us to work too much.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the deceased at every funeral.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a nice evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climatic conditions are not typical for the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary was going to help him.
Tom is never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should you take this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Like us on Facebook! <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was “yes.”
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We are dependent on work.
The box is made of clay.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust in your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's angry.
Try not to pay any attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the pot.
There was a lot of sperm, there was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very annoyed.
I've been vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to play too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was single.
Are you interested, Tom?
Here it is.
I'd like to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do his best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate tortoise soup.
We can work outdoors if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you've hidden Tom's jewels.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're an expert.
What’s not in it for her?
It's not an ordinary pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed distraught.
Tom says that Mary should be happy.
My car blew.
I'm not smart.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my comrades.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Are we here to wait for her?
If you get out so naked, you'll get cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything, Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don’t want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom's been hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You're white again!
Stop beating the dick.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Unnecessarily dramatizing.
We believe in God.
We have to take whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with the co-workers?
It smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan was urging Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've already forgiven you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's the abbreviation?
Thank you for coming back.
We're moms.
The wounded soldier barely walked away.
The sun has just risen.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you suffocate me?
What's stopping Tom from doing that again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is reflected from the water.
Tom, I'm soaking soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police put Dan in jail.
Get back to your seats.
Do I dare to touch you?
You missing something?
To make a man sit down and cry.
Are you going to help him?
We walked among the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd be on Tom's side.
They couldn’t avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to His prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate when you fight.
I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was pouring his bowl with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer was denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is, don't give Tom any presents.
Tom was busy.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the hallway.
Do you want me to invent something?
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
Europeans like to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows the most important cities.
What's under the cover?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom puts them all in for a drink.
Are you ready to go?
Tom obviously went insane.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her lip.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she comes back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start caring?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
My job hurts.
The question is who will do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wonder child.
He walks to school.
It’s starting to come into our minds that we can’t ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what to do.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Don't worry about it.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston, huh?
Tom annoyed Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my rooms.
They didn't act quickly.
I'm weak.
Knitted woolen sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
You'll never be accepted into that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Are you looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my business.
Tom hasn't made it public.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
Animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for a refund.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better as soon as he drinks a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If so, it will be repaired... when the crow bears a grape.
Tom's an adviser.
Can I have a word with you?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when has there been a firefighter?
It's possible that Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair's falling out.
The big question that no one has found an answer to, including me, despite thirty years of research into the female soul, is “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The peasants are harvesting.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did he ask her to leave?
Keep your promises. Keep your promises.
I've searched everywhere.
What was the object?
Every time we die, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around. She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was insane.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They're all up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold on to my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Wait a second.
I've got a lot to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's quite a bit of air here.
She married a man for zero.
The wind is strong.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything fancy.
The old man sighed before his death.
I don't like the book.
Fortunately, I hit him.
Why would Tom want that?
The Sun is a star among billions of others.
I caught measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go in the afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is a TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm looking for.
Are you sure we don't have to make an appointment first?
Anyone who can hear butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to obey.
Just find them.
I can't end up with them.
They pulled a bark to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to wait like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work hours.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The river is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time you left.
He's a bandit.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom's a little squeaky.
Tom is very immature.
What did they do?
What is the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got a drink.
I'm very fond of your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the plug.
Will I be replaced?
I need to find some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are kind of mammals.
Dan yelled at Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom looks shocked.
Are they brothers?
“Did you like his music?” “No, and you?”
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
They're about to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't like fish.
I've seen Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian to her.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this one.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles are there from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm doing.
Does it hurt too much?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every country has its own language.
You'd never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
As it happened, so it happened.
His legs were swollen.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me a location on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the pilgrimage.
Look forward. Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom harassing you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been well for two days.
The gut's a waste, it's too easy to bend.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have been surprised.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these. Take these.
We're expecting her.
Getting out of the rain doesn’t come in handy.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an ass.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a shitty egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle it.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right away.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already believe.
He writes a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We were barely saved.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You're gonna be better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and scratch her - it counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her that I love her.
Find your own supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's seated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He blew a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It’s better to be optimistic and cheat than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Well, given what you've been cooking, I'm going to do the dishes.
Let's leave the topic.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your fitness.
There's false eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cake.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Can you hear the knocking?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
“Are you angry with me?” “Oh, no!”
He's not as shy a boy as he used to be.
You count?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom's never been mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's too easy to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jamlia, some tile, some with a ball. Others rode a wheel or rode wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowy.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both need to go.
The pain that arouses love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He shaved his head.
We're late.
Bring back the seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting mad.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
Today it is less humid than yesterday.
I find it hard to make new friends.
It’s strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't figure out what the baby wants, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might come back.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix eyelids?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slat on one side.
Let's have a bite.
I'll be out right away.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She does not know how to read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You've got a lot of pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail someday.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
There's no food left.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him for the job.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
He was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a match in the dungeon.
How much does it cost her?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
In which state is Boston located?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had inflammation of the lungs, I just squatted in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is very happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's got a headache.
Well, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He gave his best.
He's a coward.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house is in need of repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom's not listening.
They love everything you've told them you're going to give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What's it all about?
Is it Necessary?
Tom's back.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it's best you call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German donuts.
We were eighteen years old then.
I make thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They're drunk.
Tom began to grieve.
I think you should choose her.
Stand still.
You're magnificent.
Tom's lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a duxer.
Tom looks resolute.
I'm glad he didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary, don't wash the gardens.
Tom's a joke.
I felt much worse.
Tom was trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
Just a glass of wine.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart's broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth full.
They're all in control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What did you do the last time?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is spoiled.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's opting us out.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't invite him to parties often.
He doesn’t look like his father at all.
Tom's not exactly hardened.
It was after midnight.
That's outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, not expecting anything to happen.
They persuaded me to quit smoking.
It's warm here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
The skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I wouldn't want to get caught.
Their friendship quickly turned into a love affair.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm gonna stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't think of a party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom smeared his toast with butter.
There's a job waiting for us.
I heard it like a snort.
Shall we call Tom?
Tom sent you, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the reedon.
I'll take whatever it is.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's going to be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be accustomed to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I poured coffee on the flies.
He rarely went there.
Tom's sick.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the victors are always right, and the losers are the culprits.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if at all it can be said that it is possible.
It was an arena day.
I've got bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many squats do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came in and found me, his whole body ran out of alcohol.
Tom's healing.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You're too tight when you're handcuffed.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come for you, Tom.
He won first place in the match.
I just want you back.
They smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday, she stayed until late.
You're screwed.
Everybody's quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it looks weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Let someone open the door.
Do you own this?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
“Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how much we need?
He was in despair because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got earaches.
He was punched in the face with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You must be in the middle of the night.
It's not the right time now.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom has become famous.
A song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What does Tom have in mind?
My mother's advice would outweigh my friend's.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's getting mad.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a jacket.
Dan is now looking for the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I screwed him up.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw it worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to cook pasta.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I need.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom's a nice guy.
Stop yelling, I'm getting a headache.
You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful look!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get tired.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on her carmine.
She's got a picture.
Artificial swimming.
The flowers are coming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, under emergency!
Oh, we're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna be scared, so he's gonna give up.
Is there a free place?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me for it yet.
I want tea.
In any case, I wouldn't want to run into it.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to be quiet.
Tom decided that Mary was having a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him playing the tune on the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's been fooling around.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
It's complex.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you take part in this event?
There is almost no coffee left in the cup.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I'd rather have coffee than tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy the company of humans.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lighted the curtain, just by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is rising.
Tom immediately responded to Mary’s question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can Myrtle Be Used in Meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save him, Tom.
You didn't solve the problem, did you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom was very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without the help of someone else.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't love him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom was outraged.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
He's been studying me a lot.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I've got quality.
Did anyone find a way to take care of the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom nodded aloud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
There's nothing to say.
It'd be good.
It's fast on foot.
Tom's very grumpy.
That's all I've said.
Tom has a butler.
Day got Linda out of here safely.
They're my cousins.
It's 11:00 already.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen him personally.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems a little nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they are not present.
My sister does her hair on a hairdresser two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
The water from the rain evaporates when it is warm.
Ask him to wait until I get here.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
Looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom's probably still in school.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
You're below his level.
My goal is to get hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom may have hired Mary, but I'm not sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to convince Mary to accept the job.
How much of our body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very smart.
Please help me to meet Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Do not stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
What'd you get so far?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary at the French lesson.
How can you help her?
Tom lured him into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody did anything else.
I'm sorry to fall like this.
Books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped out the gardens.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good point.
I'm sure they're worried.
I've transported him.
That gave me an idea.
The clock's ticking.
I asked about him.
Tom says that Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, get me.
This is a good place to park.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I want something new.
The children need love.
It's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It's gonna hurt.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe that anything can happen.
You need to eat less red meat.
You have to watch the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is already a problem.
Tom's grabbing a gun.
Tom shut the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made the box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledgehammer.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they're paying pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Oh, look at me.
How many liters of oil does a storm collect?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The bulb is green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom murmured.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's on the alert.
Tom lost his hair.
They all sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate the school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
Let's just get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
Prohibited speaking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You need to write a thank-you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom says he wants to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We took care of you.
Experience is not inherited – each one acquires his own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I'm hiding it.
Did you hear about him?
Tom began to talk.
I ran away for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a bait, I'm gonna have a hard time catching fish.
Tom was sleeping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupted.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol lowers the inhibitions.
Tom needs both of them.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom looked confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
The pupils were black and as deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please do it again.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licked.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends up.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why don't you buy more than one?
We were working.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your bravery.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?

I use it every day.
It's yours.
Do you think we can come too?

What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's the turner.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this myself.

I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was well-intentioned.

There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here, let's go.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're comrades with him.
I may admire others, but I’ve never stumbled upon being anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to tell if Tom is happy or not.

Here's what I like about him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them licking.
Too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I need to see Tom.
What's bothering you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?

This is classified.
That's not so much.

Let me be damned!
I'd walk alone first.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.

He has a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.

We waited.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether he will visit us next month.
The puppets run the wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls teased her because of her clothes.
You're going to be confused.
I won't follow you.

Something was wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fed up.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long has Tom been left?

Tom seems to be desperate.
You sound like it made you feel better.

I turned Tom down.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in a bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my bags?
We all know Tom.
Let's do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
- Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes ahead of you.
I'm helping him.
It's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All children are aliens.
I got shot.
Tom isn't prone to drama.
I completed 25 projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't go away without looking through the keychain.
The tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you believe them?
That pillar isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to go back.
That's what I mean.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary said to him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew that Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few more minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom certainly loves you very much.
You're a good cook.
There is no shorter way to the top, only to the failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was a pity.
Looks like you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automated vehicles are now widespread.
I can't make a decision like that.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give it your all.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I called Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my supper?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a jackass.
I love the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave a teddy bear to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I called for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the goat?
They picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a mess I spent the evening with a smart, witty, pretty girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents’ control.
Tom's a spoiler.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He stripped himself of his clothes to take a bath.
A river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight it.
I'm studying mathematics.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you wash?
Movies are a great time out.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
You made me love jazz. You made me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning to leave.
How many guests can we expect tonight?
She's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat down patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They can come back.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
The whole board is against it.
The world illuminates the sun.
His arguments were logical.
Come to you now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Try to avoid bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary wants hot coffee, and Tom wants milk.
I gave him a fake address.
I got up.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
What matters to me is what you think about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom nodded.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommends it to Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to talk.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom ate it all.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom's gone without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
You're screwing up.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right away.
Let me help you.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running up.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom was about to clash with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom to be in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary had to say.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I know how to ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping standing.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks good.
Has anyone broken your heart? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
That's how I feel.
What's bothering you?
We'd like to see Tom.
Where'd you get Tom?
Who won the award?
Please, come in time.
The Germans have a slower attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
He visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with mustaches.
Forget about your wallet again.
Do you accept bribes?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly, I heard a loud noise.
They both came back.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
Itch, I wasn't lucky.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I've really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always loved mysterious characters.
Throw the ball at me.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American singer-songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom Hornby will never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I've missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really fucked up.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I've already given her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started to talk.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right path.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been out of work for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got kicked out.
You won't get bored.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought fragrant garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom seldom goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
Looks like you already know the answer.
Would you mind taking us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the boat?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come and save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was scaly brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handcuffs.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My fork hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the lower floor.
The girls are not going to play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary has broken up our friendship.
I just can’t get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's caress.
We've got to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear a suit.
The gravel is ruined.
He's gone.
His clientele is made up mostly of the poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People are constantly dying.
This one fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He pulled out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a bit reluctantly Saturday.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom knocked him out.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me the book back, I need it again.
Mark thinks he's good at writing.
Tom looked up.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very organized.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
What a jerk you are!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom's been suspended.
They cleaned up.
She's going to be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks pissed off.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's good.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom's getting violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed.
It's from work.
We'll figure it out.
Praise encourages students to do bad things.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the door of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's the deal?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
He was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom looks a little shaken.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblewomen.
He has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak in your own name.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My dog uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a stab wound deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm getting paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can take a break.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
He used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed it, Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are working on something.
Just leave us in peace.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder go down?
Don't mix work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your patent's off.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and pointed it towards the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary's help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not quite right.
The rats are small.
Please, stay close by.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm bored of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw it, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent the company a million dollars.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This Tom's ringing.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday, my head's spinning, I'm a great chump.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't care what the guy's name was.
I'm gonna grab hold of your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom shut the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you want to borrow an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He wanted a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I said my own.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is single.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's pissed.
I don't even know what's what.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You're gonna feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool in which Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the post office.
What college did you study at?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my arm.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just got in.
He broke a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
He exaggerated her!
He has a missing son.
I'm trying to work.
What taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a premonition that the show will be canceled; we sold something a lot of tickets.
Tom's coming.
Tom believes he should not use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go write at home.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
My goal is to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom's looking awkward.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own mania.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look agitated?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm so grateful for you.
You've already caught a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary is the right expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd pour the bowl.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom's looking nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom shoved him to the ground.
There is no end to the lecture!
The cups are in the cup pot.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you still don't sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
He led the love.
I lit the trash.
We've both seen it.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a good point.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the clock.
Isn't that great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you paint a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just get this job done.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would come back.
It always works well.
In which country are you a citizen?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm going to meet Tom.
I like dogs more than cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know he cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
Can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost done together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits down for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
They were all talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you give her a call?
Loud.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was repressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's still some tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The thunder made me nervous.
This is justifiable.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop star.
I'd like to see an order.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is that, Tom?
I have problems with my sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's a skilled handcuffed saw.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
They beat the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I seem to have made a mistake.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been coming back for a week, up and down.
It is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want flip-flops.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really pissed off.
Let Tom talk. Let him talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was smeared with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's being done to me tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm very confused.
They waited outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything about you.
Tom aspires to become a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's overpriced.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't care what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shayka slammed the tire.
We made a tree.
This is so much better.
I'll make her cut your lawn.
Tom's a mathematician.
Tom withdraws his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can take a break.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're broke.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
He knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think it's weird just because it's not a protein.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't dispute that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It still doesn't work.
Cite me an example.
Definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he sincere?
The field was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
Vampires are alive in the ark of the dead.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where do these documents need to be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is under threat.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is that true?
I know you're angry.
When I got past Saturday morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom becomes cloudy.
Tom took pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I don’t have enough money at the moment.
“Are you a vegetarian?” “No, and you?”
Lightning hits the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking to me.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father was dead.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What to do today?
Do you believe in the horoscope?
I know I'm going.
Contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom is very good at his job.
I've figured it all out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom's done all this.
I won't betray her.
Flowers are attracted to bees.
Water is milk.
First, there was no plant life in this sub-sky.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's response?
You will do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at that.
She's got narrow hips.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
No time for explanations.
Are they going to arrest me?
It violates all the rules.
Why aren't you at home?
You have to resign.
We were trying to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound dropped pus.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
I'm sure Tom's feeling lonely.
What are you looking for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom dumped Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't really agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
A moral choice is for the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language that produced them.
You're disgusting.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems to be upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here for as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
There was a huge crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could have done better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's already too late.
You've found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're skiing.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew that Mary was going to like John.
Tom's a moron.
I just cut off my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
That's the cure right.
We went down the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
It depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? - No.
Tom was looking at you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her granddaughter.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom was stunned.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started to squirt.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak in your own name.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're good for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
Forget your backpack!
So conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel is going to be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's nice to see you.
You can leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
To the evidence?
When we woke up in the morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is now swollen.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't have dropped anything.
Tom is a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered a great loss.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What else do you eat?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a menthol candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I'm about to cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy guy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a walnut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
Tom re-reads the note.
The children painted pictures of the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering why you've stayed so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared it.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast about the magnificent chandeliers that are in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What is your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
He's a good swimmer.
You're not gonna find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not tracking.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Didn't I do something to piss Tom off?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned off the carmine.
Guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this be between us.
I've asked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up when it's morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom looks stunned.
Tom stepped down.
It's the way it should be.
Let's try to get together.
It's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for the question.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.

I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved before.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
There's nothing urgent.
I'll collect it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not exactly Tom's favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We have to go find them.
The last time I was home on Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a pain in the ass.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's definitely pissed.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened in school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom's on time.
Today, television is boring.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Tom found a clover with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom's looking really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please, look at me.
She gave up on smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We went to say goodbye to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's the law!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom's safely here.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks flying from the focal point.
It's just made up.
Tom had been talking to Mary all night.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I'm always dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather the soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming up.
We're heading for Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He passionately kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of beet spray.
It was filthy.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my dad.
The kids love cakes.
He was very restrained.
I can end up with Tom.
Tom's getting annoyed.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still love a horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money from Tom.
Enough of the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
He has always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to croak.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's out of work early.
Everything is with us.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You were right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
I'm sure they're fakes.
Beauty can not be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has poor eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't take pictures in prison.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it ready?
They all want lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom closed his eyes.
The tribe was not too happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put on your apron.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in high school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything that needs to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can get some rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There is no one in the school.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room below?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I’ve never changed my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come on in.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll take you.
I set it up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom knows how to be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very brave.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask for me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's home again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We are mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I have to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I overeat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was inspiring.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems to be jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and attached another one to the wall.
Stop! Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows aren’t smart at all.
That was very negligent on Tom's part.
It's fucked up.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I was angry.
Let them shave you off.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom stared inside.
At the same time you are both heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I'm not listening.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's disappointing.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't get it.
Tom's a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You failed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with the tray.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very fusher-written.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't cry for us.
She wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom twisted the knob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
They're all pissed off.
Tom didn't protest.
What are the websites made of?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
He wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he will not be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
How far is Boston?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later in the afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was on his way to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cap out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the jaw.
The gulls symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
A traitor!
I will do my best for the good of humanity.
Did he really stay home all night?
Andy's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm sleeping.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a relationship between the character and the blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Don’t smoke too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
Playing on the computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking for them everywhere.
I like your website a lot.
I'll catch you.
Press the button on it.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom scanned his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's tough.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I can see how things stand.
I'm making a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sounded reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees have fallen.
Lions do not distinguish colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is silly.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look at us.
I want you to give me my money back right away.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are now married.
I guess we both lied to each other.
I was happy to be here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you getting married to Tom.
Tom's acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why Do Cows Survive?
There's pus in my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are brittle.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They didn't take a curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn him around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Jellyfish live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very well.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I got it.
Did you get here by car?
I don’t know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure of it.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
Something's weakening me.
I know you don't speak French.
Did he call you?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for accepting me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather have eggs than pods.
Can you explain that to me?
Where's his house?
Love is for insane people.
Why would you help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We have lost our faith in humanity.
Tom's dealing with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I'm doing.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna get a lot of bandages.
I'm a faggot.
Let's see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Do you mind if I come to you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He licks the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I need to cut my monthly expenses.
No one is talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What use do I have for you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It burns me when I wear that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
There was nothing funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this.
They believed it.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I've underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
The third lucky.
We've got to go.
This is an airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for the virtues and forsake the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm late.
I could've known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just hitting you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inconvenient time.
The dog stared at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is beautiful, but the memories are still there.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I think about it all day.
I suggest we focus on the demand for exiting the caverns.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check for her.
That's right, people!
The building is a monstrous building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it a lot!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like a squirrel.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I am not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I'm assuming you've read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are rotten.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
It's an accident, Tom.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was angry.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally strong.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded agitated.
They started to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall.
"I got nine on the chemistry test. And you?" "The same."
He was lucky to have survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was showy.
How was the toy?
I'm a student.
I'm fine.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I'm not happy when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
Looks like I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would he say?
Make two rows.
The titles should attract the attention of the readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than be submissive.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That's it.
I watched a French film with an English translation.
Tom laughed at Mary.
Tom is full of self-confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother tells me that my child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a turbulent relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us back.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at the wedding.
Who would have chosen Tom?
The hospital isn’t that big.
Most people have to work in order to survive.
Nothing's ever going to change.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not chasing their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I love freedom, I don't want and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys at the age of eleven to twelve.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon be cleared.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She's been sniffed.
Epten was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I have a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The people rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't be shy when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half of them are women.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
It's on Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job to redeem myself for everything I’ve done.
Tom tied his strings.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware of this?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.

You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student's party.
Mary provides a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who will pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
- Does Mary like Tom? - No.
I was waiting outside for you.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have it?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom's been busy.
Do you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be stupid.
I still have a lot of respect for Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had a speech prepared.
Falcons have a rough look.
I wrote it to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was trumpeting.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a taxi.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
The teapot is pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off the car.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano was once again active.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The small island from a distance looks like a turtle.
Do the grasshoppers bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop blanching.
I'm 30 years old.
But his acting is by no means perfect.
Definitely they are.
Don't wait.
You still don't know how long.
The dog was barking.
Let's go to the movie.
Good women age much better than good women.
Tom has sheep.
He kicked it.
Mary felt the warmth of her face.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retiring.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom unnecessarily raises a jaw.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
Do you think I don't care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts so bad here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's done.
It's unnatural.
What did he steal?
Tom's never gonna finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You weren't right about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be more kind to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's messing with him.
Faith is the hope of that which the mind cannot hope for.
Tom was with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The snout's coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Choose your weapon.
They chose a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's dragging himself behind.
We cherish our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They wanted to raise their wages.
I've stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake triggered the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What the hell do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The grating stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon on the ground.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do it.
It's like it's smeared.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan is not working.
It's not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You understand?
The day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's got the flu.
I don't wait very long.
Just look at yourself.
This is grandiose.
It is empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand that.
The shop is closed.
They're listening.
Tom came out.
That's all I can do.
He sticks to his principles.
Tom's angry.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They've broken it up.
Tom's a big civic.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
They swayed like an eel.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the rubbish in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I'm teaching Chinese.
Tom was sitting on a desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off your mask.
That's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm blaming myself.
I liked the way you danced.
I need some.
They lied to us.
Tom is right.
Tom seems to be scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now order him.
It's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom's getting violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
The condors are grieving me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad condition.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was out of breath.
Can you get to those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf's full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
Applauded.
He cut me off.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How do I find him?
The ice has melted.
I've spewed blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must have made you a lot easier.
I've never been caught.
I love my country.
I have not learned to write.
It's stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't put me down.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom stole from me.
Victory is poor.
They look in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Mary to the door.
It looks very tasty.
I need to figure it out.
You two have come up against me!
I've never had a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
Tom tried it all.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're slipping.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It's probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new line for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but it's also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My biggest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary left us from day one.
Let's move.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off the car.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her thigh.
They extinguished the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom snarled at Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came, even though it was raining.
I don't want to use a dildo - I prefer real cocks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sundays.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay quiet if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom kicked me out.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I already told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's going alone.
Tom only had Fridays at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.

The tooth has a temporary seal.
Tom was actually laughing.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They were contacted by local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me the card.

How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 a week pocket money.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom cut me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's convenient to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cool.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
- Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
You want a job?
They're losing their minds.
He's really burning me.
I can go anywhere I want.
He was often bullied in school.
When does it start?
The bear touches itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like his dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I doubted.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You need to buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do afterwards?
Watch out for Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'm going to change first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chukunbaba just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Did you look everywhere?
It’s important to remember that no one is ever 100 percent.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.

I was getting a snooze.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
It was Tom’s last words.

She wants to become an actress.
My plastic bottle's broken.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're refined.

I can send her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and kept quiet.
I'm collecting postage stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
A snail looks like a snail.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I want comics.
You have a really good manuscript.
The wind continued to blow.
In the meantime, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?

Do you have a band?
You're free to wait here.
I got a Friday in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.

How do you get from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's nothing scary.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to wear a mask this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's locked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
It's at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're making me strong enough.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You don't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary did.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky brightened up.
The Galama will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not really something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play rhymes.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom thinks he'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two o'clock.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and donuts.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
The two of them laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom was feeling strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Are you cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you're growing up fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would have cared.
Did you write in the diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is it yours on the radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the keychain, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you squealing?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
Up and down, we're ready.
Tom has a hard hearing.
I bought them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him open the table.
I ate snails with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go down the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom drank.
I was sleeping in the slumber.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can search in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
You baked cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
He shoved me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stalled.
You're forgetting your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important to me.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems to be lonely.
How come you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you'll be able to get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demek, do I need to know you?
Tom skillfully concealed all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't think so.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of a variety of vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just blew Tom's room off last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell a dog if it were taller.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son likes rockets a lot.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a loser.
We despise her.
He's in front of them.
Here, brother, halfway.
Tom sent the new fly that he had just bought to the table.
Tom is going to help Mary.
He grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's smoked.
The landscape is superb.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic jam?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could be fired for this.
What is the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was very majestic.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to figure it out.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom stared into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, don't you see how poor I am?
Seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous of him.
I offered to smoke his cock, but he told me he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're an insightful man.
Everything seemed to be fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
I'm kind of flattered.
I'm practicing.
Maybe she lied to you, but I'm not there.
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a couscous.
It’s just to solve this task.
He has to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's great fun.
Does Tom look agitated?
If you can, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunglasses.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
Looks like you don't know how it hurts to pat yourself down.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like there's no point in asking Tom.
My brother's coming tomorrow Saturday.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary over for the rep.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him grimaces.
I waited outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a stone at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can remember a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all under the radar.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom still isn't able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days are there before Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't like that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's running out.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn’t honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating Tom.
I want roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic jam.
We've been hustled.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a shudder.
It's all right.
Tom seems to be worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is the camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what your responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off the mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done with the packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow your book.
It is impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be cute.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
Sounds really loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom tied his strings.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's unreasonable.
Women in the United States have no right to vote.
My neighbor called a fire department.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom's not listening to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom went off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm is ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an indisputable fact.
Is it delicious?
Be careful!
We need to give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is a bucket.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little sloppy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are kind of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the bull going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck! Try your luck!
I may not be graduating.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy the sentence.
Dan adorned the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the curtain.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want riddles.
The book will help you to write skillfully.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary on Saturday.
Nasabayle, I'm gonna toast my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom dumped his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is enthralled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making cake.
Look at the countdown.
I'm fascinated by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it all off.
Tom's choking.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna take off the car.
That’s what happened and preceded it.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What use is that to us?
I’m with the person I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
“How are you?” “Okay, thank you!”
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick catch-up.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree with you.
Why did you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom doesn't like sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
It's a message for them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom lifted the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your equal.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He shoved the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try it.
Demek wrote his own book!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They're looking around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked him to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to insulate it.
Tom's not well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand dengue.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go in pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
I took off my pants.
I asked him what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to spilling the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush is respectful of human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loire.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little forward.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just grab my arm.
I shouldn't have believed her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs should I do a day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to go away.
Tom is very kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You've got a lot of piercing eyes.
Isn't that understandable?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to the city.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Sniff it and get in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems reliably.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not sociable.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
It develops dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat down and were silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary's been messing with her mother.
Choose one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mission.
Tom wiped the knife from his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Do you bleed your neck?
Just let me call her, okay?
Tom put his beer ring on the pot.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
I get a seductive look.
Come on, don't be embarrassed.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you get downstairs?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda beat Dan up because he dumped her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not disturb Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave decently.
I need to set us free.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who can break the aquarium? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It came through my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
He has struggled with depression for many years of his life.
You want me to grab your pockets?
I would trust it with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class looks.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom's just gone.
Dan called for a hitchhiker.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you've made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll keep an eye on him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to speak with four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She is studying English.
With such a lush dream, you will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We are going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommends that?
How'd you get that out?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won’t pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked very strong.
What to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better at chess than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said that Mary is Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We were trying to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn the lights off.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tightrope.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's with the bell, Tom?
He's very handy.
Pay attention to the buyer.
Tom often runs for hours.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most girls have a whole hymn.
You can come out at the end.
Why did you only bake two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint; when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be fine.
Is there a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to something like this.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking more French than he was speaking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture, the speaker was supposed to speak slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
This medicine calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please, accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother is an American.
Relax a little.

Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's up to me, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working well.
Tom got sick badly.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
We'll never find out now.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just freaked him out.
I prefer goat cheese more than cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have an unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's yours.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was nasty.
The carpenters cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zine's finished.
Same-sex couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot that it was once a calf.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a handy thing.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister throw away the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at the place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign or voice of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give rise to other lies.
I don't have the money anymore.
Stolov is plastic.
Sunlight is arguably the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always soulless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very useful.
He's lifting me up.
Did he call for an ambulance already?
After lunch, we plan to go for a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Turns on the red light.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
The blood circulates through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells of mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the Prince want?
Where do we come from, where did we go?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stud?
Tom's in the mood for attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy to me.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's going to bother you.
Tom didn't really think of that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to walk.
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're annoying me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'm gonna get sick.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't make him mad, Tom.
It's a painful task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised that it was so easy.
If only he were here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I'm not here to hurt people.
I'm sure Tom already knew about it.
My sister and my mother's aunt.
I've been looking for them everywhere.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny that.
It's gone red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very secluded.
Maybe it'll turn out tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom got a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His excuses are far from perfect.
I hope we can beat Tom.
Get your things out of the way.
Where'd you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't have to be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a scarf.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell off the wall.
The clock's been ripped off.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom pulled the joke out of his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower stood in ruins.
Tom is a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the pliers.
Huskies love the cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Do you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the beef.
Canada produces a good amount of wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not that we're doing anything.
Tom had a good day today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he planned to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
How about a little sushi?
How are you doing?
I'm feeling better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
In spite of our expectations, no accusations have been made.
Desire is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I have always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I won't be in town next week.

Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Have you seen anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When will I be on my way?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It doesn’t happen very often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I was barely saved from being caught.
I'm not allowed to interfere.
You beat them.
They're silent.
Tom came back soon enough.
I'd be for it.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna pay for the zian?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's bothering me here.
You're cheating me.
That's the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're breaking it.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
Izgelda, you have an infection.
I don't think there's anything smarter.
The sky is red at dusk.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd be happy if you could come too.
They must be happy.
We've got to fix this.
I speak bad English.
We'll handle it.
Bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
You want some cake?
Who brought this in?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot in hell.
I overlooked that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
I want to congratulate you on your wedding.
Kids, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Did your dog bark?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go collect them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom walked away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom himself came here.
I forgot my scarf.
We've been through a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often calls for difficult compromises.
Tom just got his prosthesis removed.
I have to try and find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake Mary up.
You almost missed it.
I hate that pipe.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Do you look like Tom to a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It relaxes a lot.
Keep your weapons ready to go.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was endangered.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn’t anyone want to help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom let out the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the train.
It’s nice to have such gifts.
I embarrassed him.
They'll throw you out or they'll throw you out.
Get out of here.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm good, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He was blind from birth.
The book contains 15 biographies.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
Socks and shoes are new.
I haven't eaten pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
Tom is buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What is Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dalida died from an overdose of sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign up downstairs, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're not actually big enough to be here.
I got the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slayer.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my gosh, he's coming back.
Ish, yuckle!
They rip into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think he is.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't even come home last night.
I think we've eaten enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom's looking sloppy.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there's a solution.
You're disorganized.
I'm insisting.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it this way.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the task?
We need to get back to him.
You're uncultured.
Do you do sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people of Madrid are insane.
That's completely inaccurate.
I'd better call her first.
He's very sociable.
Tom can't wait any longer.
I only exercise to look good when I'm naked.
A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Honestly.
We have three guards who work alternately.
We can't stay together, it wasn't written down.
Visitors are welcome .
Could you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox, will you?
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We've both been busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
You don't hate him, do you?
Stop behaving like a child.
Tom's not crazy.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom is a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will be leaving his parents' home.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband is a doctor.
It's a spider bite.
Tom didn't really want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than the price of pearls.

That new song is called "Little Man."
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six bucks.
We all have our own price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
Legend has it that she was a siren.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I’m used to talking in public.
She was crying out of happiness.
Tom came out of prison.
It's nice to work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to turn green.
Do you want me to smear your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I nodded my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm coming to an end.
I'm going to change.
Put down my headphones.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want him to give me my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find me a head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
The first proposal was rejected.
Sooner or later, I'm going to break the film.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, could it have happened here.
Tom was warming himself in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
He swims every day.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to mold.
You should try to write respectfully.
I'll sit there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom is very patient.
We can start.
Come alone.
You put a pencil out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Suppose she was here.
Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule for today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom looked a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you bite me, I'll bite you, too.
You really should've let me get a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The warmth of the horse's hooves calmed him.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject matter.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest dresses all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanked anyone for it.
He overreacted to his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom was hooked up with Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need to ask Tom's permission.
Everyone laughed at his jokes.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I've smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop gambling.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I flushed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She looked so excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary won't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Come and visit us tomorrow.
Tom went to see Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your purse?
This will help her sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'm going to prep the dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
Dolkun has been working very hard lately, but he doesn’t see the slightest result of it.
Dan finds out that Linda is looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not sure.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is more powerful than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
Last night, he spent the night drinking in a tavern.
I'm in.
Do you need rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to borrow from you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is definitely a joke.
You wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the vignette.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling. Keep smiling.
He didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from the prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that is not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What should I tell the kids now?
Leave it to Tom.
I overcame the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom that tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew that Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you go on vacation?
Then we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She began to soak her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the pain in your back?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects postage stamps.
I want you to find her.
The water shines in the sun.
A is a set consisting of Articles B, B and A.
Tom is free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't have a dear Tom.
I'd be happy if the three of you were back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The children breathe bubbles.
Tom practiced the violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's a lot of fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and I suffered with them.
Camille Tom had more time for me.
I'm kicking him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She was able to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I have no willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is full of noise.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed to be a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I'll have to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don’t forget to apply sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't be a jerk.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to go overboard.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
“Music is just love in search of words.”
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm starving you to lie down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your mistake.
The balloon slowed down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something to take our minds off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus on it.
She sells naval schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child was crying and crying for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom doesn't look like his brother at all.
Tom was innate.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you enthralled?
Tom couldn't have done it by himself.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cuts the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.
I've got chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show up first.
My father is a silent man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
He stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
He's rehearsed.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're breaking it.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you feed her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your excuse is up-and-down correct.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary walked out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complex.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gemstones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night are shining.
No one will be fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling from Boston to New York, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my feet.
How can you say that?
Tom catches the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me the porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom rinsed his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom is not mistaken.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems to be hurt.
We know him.
With hours of sleep over there.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints annoyed me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
You think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy here.
What can be taken?
I'm guessing you found it.
Don't take it too bluntly.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going for a point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have collapsed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby peeps the candle.
Now I'm gonna go find Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This is gonna do the job for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without burdens.
You totally misunderstood me.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me an asshole.
I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open the 9th page.
Tom untied his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really do like the wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We were arguing.
Did Tom eat the grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't pee, or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked him to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom is in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his family what had happened.
He was in the mud to his knees.
You told Tom about it, didn't you?
Tom's calling Mary's.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Aren't you panicking?
We have to do this again sometime.
I think Tom is contemplative.
He's a sincere man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
It's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom's here to ask for help.
I find it easy to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the punctuation marks is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Are you coming to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
The house is built of bricks.
We didn't draw any conclusions.
Tom arrived at about 2:30.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I have a cat swim.
The crowd applauded.
I leave clovers to grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna catch your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We're reluctant.
I was too tired to keep going.
It has its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call last night from a man named Tom Jackson.
Is it possible to use this site in a similar way to Twitter?
It shouldn't be too hard to finish the report by 2:30.
Tom has been doing this for a while now.
Heteronormativity is closely related to sexism.
She's got a nude.
Are yours all pouches?
Why do you want to learn English?
Is Tom already gone?
Tom must have made himself important.

Movies are worth watching.
My breasts are growing.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I get to explain everything to you.
Dan went back to London.
My dad bought me a digital wristwatch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's a badass.
Don't you feel lonely?
Have you brewed coffee?
Don't be so happy about it.
Get up when you talk to me.
He's always happy.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's obsessive.
Most of the clothes that Europeans wear are made outside of Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search on the internet.
When I was younger, I used to travel by bus.
I couldn't figure out exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will complain.
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
I bought myself a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet is in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I pee, something like pus comes out.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
This will teach them order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy such a house.
Tom sighed.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don’t understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.
Tom was hired.
The time passed especially quickly.
There's no way out.
The frequent rains at night make it more difficult to rescue the survivors of the crashed ferry.
My wife is hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom's mad.
Look at the countdown.
There's got to be a key.
Cut the apple in half.
All the balls are yellow.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Lie down on the couch.
Did they hit someone?
The factory manufactures toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like a commodity.
There was water everywhere on the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still on sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
Every once in a while, a car would pass me.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no way I'll get the job done in a day.
She was almost shattered by horror.
All of a sudden I felt old.
They're making me nervous.
It was nighttime.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge your dead father.
Tom took the cake.
I have been learning French since I was 13 years old.
In fact, men are not that different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite oils for cleansing the face and nourishing the skin.
It's in my head from the French language.
I don't care if there are 20 women.
The bull torments.
Tom's a pedestrian.
Are you going to be open tonight?
They don't understand.
He was born in the 1960s.
Can I have one?
Baburs are usually mild in taste.
I'm shocked.
It could be raining today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have some time?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I'm not gonna bother you.
You stay here and keep her safe.
Wouldn't you start cutting your hair out of that?
How are you gonna get away?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you gonna do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like the English language?
That’s what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these meringues from my grandmother.
I have no problem with drinking.
I think I might get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary loves fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard anything from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look thoughtful.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The storm will wake the baby.
I'm late for spinach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting in the backseat with Mary watching TV.
Nothing's bothering us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
It's nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm usually not at work on Mondays.
I'm a fool to trust them.
Tom might need a little help.
They go to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
They beat the idea.
Tom was more and more surprised.
Who gave them so much money?
We have to buy them a gift.
When did the war end?
Was the pottery machine working?
Tom is a married man.
As Tom said, the soup is too salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come out here?
They stopped to talk about it.
Did you bring a fan?
That Tom did it was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Do you mind if I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're going to have to study badly next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Whoa! Whoa!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom took two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like the most.
Your sins have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
Looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I've got some terrible news.
If it were possible, I would like to experience such a bittersweet love once again as in the first place.
I saw Tom in the area.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom cracked the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom offer this?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We all want to see the movie.
I'll be in Scotland tomorrow.
We interrupted our conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's going to take a lot of work.
You can’t focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was bluffing.
They became dependent.
I just want money.
I'm not saying bad things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book he gave me was very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't choose.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
Suddenly, she was unconscious.
It looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
We're living together now.
You were busy.
I'm sorry, isn't that a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship changed course.
Tom was taken to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is it insane?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
That's what Tom said.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have a hard time.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked out.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-wingers.
Should I take pictures with or without flashes?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's go help her.
Tom is in Australia.
I think I can solve the problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom is now an adult.
We do not sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I came back by bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't behave like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The fight doesn’t seem to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's a rational.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and done.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've experienced a traffic jam, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our party.
I can do that.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check if there can be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the drug that was prescribed to you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I fell in.
I want to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need some help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started to climb up.
Tom likes you a lot.
Tom stared at Mary's face.
Now for the first time I put pepper on eggs.
I'll get it.
The medicine worked.
Tom knows how to play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I'm sick of Tom.
I like you a lot.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't believe I bought this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier in the day.
Get up again, lazy-ass!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This sofa is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd have avoided Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's continue the conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's too tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.
I don't like this.
Tom's a ton of candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
It's all ready.
She's indisposed.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Wipe yourself.
Have you settled yet?
Tom's listening.
Is anyone listening to me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know that.
I want to fuck her.
I can come in tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
It's my fault.
The dog must be chained.
I'd rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to go to bed and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital and recovering from an overdose.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were about to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem to be busy today.
I'm sure Tom was never in Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a face.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is distrustful.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
That's a good training.
The capital is peculiar.
I should have refused.
I had to consider what could happen.
That was my tactic.
I've been living here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my lily.
I know you've done your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel sorry for them.
I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I'm not commenting on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is a lot of fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's a cannon.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Get on with it, Tom.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk. I'm sorry.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom's over-the-top.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to get on the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed through action.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to leave a tip to the waiter.
It was a childlike behavior on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little awkward about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the cars.
I was kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
The tea is very tasty.
We are on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very strict with himself.
She's a bug.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamb was swaying back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom is a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I take care of them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner on the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Mary that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in a half-dream.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've been hit by something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of him, Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We've got work to do for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom likes the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in the fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Have you slept at least a little?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in an enclosed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy a picture of him.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're loaded enough with care.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems to be worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
Tom's approaching.
Tom looks shocked.
You're leaving Boston?
Tom is sympathetic.
Let it be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've gotten together.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You're not allowed to sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom's running all the way.
Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and billiard table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was annoying his sister.
We should've given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom, let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
That sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not gonna kneel.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher's shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two types of Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So what should I tell him?
Where's your child?
Tom's on the bed and he's on the phone.
These are wonderful ones.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to be proud to transfer them.
The noise disturbed the whole town.
A person who loves flowers can’t be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They're getting closer.
You're mean.
Did you hand over the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was knocking.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears underwear.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't love you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem, this is mine.
Before I went to bed, I drank three cold pills.
Tom may not be right.
They might need some help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First, you have no right to draw conclusions, and second, your argument was based on an invalid presumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I grow produce.
She borrowed the liner.
We'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to borrow her keys from me.
Tom has a moustache.
There was a war going on.
And did Tom take part?
The thief has turned into a policeman.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'm gonna wash my hands.
Choose one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and rejected.
I wish I could help you more.
I don't see Tom anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building. When I passed by her in a car, I did not recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom's forgotten.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave him a sedative.
This is not related to the topic.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
There I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.

The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser ejects a jet of hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting that we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I can go back to.
Of my own free will, I'm here.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom took over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't like math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
First, you need to get permission from your mother.

You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.

It's been a wonderful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.

Should I go?
The boy looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express the idea in a specific way.
Can I get out of here?

I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've lost something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
He has always been poor.
That's a beautiful alga.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was fighting with Mary.
Were you home alone?
He's got a lot of money out of her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to go back to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?

I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Sometimes people ask me what I’m going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.

I'll scream.
I'm not your runner.
What's our status?
You want me to hear it?
You're a real human being.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
Why did you have to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.

You should be all right.
I obeyed the rules.

There's one thing I don't understand.
He gets excited by listening to music.
Try the shirt on.
I'll tell Tom you're here.

It was a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan did his job very well.
My legs are still hurting.
I'd do anything to help him.

That's good.

You bought something for Mary.
Nothing looks more like a drunken madman.
Take Tom.

I heard him.
We're looking at the whole area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he'd like me to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
Here we are.
Why do they do that?
I've been in college for four years, and I've got nothing but a poor degree.

Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the store.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speaks a Caucasian language that has neither phonemes nor letters in common with English, can completely master English in just two years?

I can barely move around.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.

You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.

Tom, don't make me look like Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.

In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, the cave is stable, otherwise the storm would have knocked it down last night.

I'll give up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with joy.
It's bad to be pissed.
I've only got one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant grievances.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's making herself mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too quickly.
You scared her.
Tom's been cheating on us.
What did I say?

Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I look forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
Seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
Damn, I didn't even know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.

I can't see anything.
Get your horses out.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom was feeling very lonely.

He did miracles.
The glands carry chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
You'd better not talk so much.
This is a new model.
I've been helping him.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's nice to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
It's coming to you!
You could have refused.
Why don't you let me help you?
It's going to happen soon.
Hey, it's suffocating here, get me out before I suffocate.
What's going to happen will happen.
I've heard that story.
There's still a prison outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.

Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.

I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play Truth or Dare.
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the right reason.
Tom likes flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I'm unconscious.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
You know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.

My wife is getting out of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amebas are single-celled organisms.
Tom said there was someone here who needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom waved his hand.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday it was hot, but today it's more durable.
I'm cool.
He went ahead of me.
Give it back to me.
He's breathing?
Tom left Boston last night.
This is not fair to me.
Someone may have been following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so annoying.
The child kept all his money in a cash register.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This is not gonna work.
He's recently gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed to be fine.
The mother was rude to her adoptive father.
An international language would be of great use to mankind.

She's good-natured.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Do you want soda water?

We had a terrible time.
Tom looks different today.
Throw them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in monasteries.
Don't be so perverted!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's a money launderer.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you knew how to swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
I've been betrayed.
And he's taking the paper off.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you gave a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb's cremenades, potatoes, and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents got divorced?
French is hard.
I seldom ask questions.
You're a prisoner.

I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke rises in the air.
The printer is not working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a scumbag.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The Prince is agreeable.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the match.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm a loner.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'm gonna kill you.
Most people have a great deal of resistance to getting up early, even when it has to.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
Why are you so excited?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should understand themselves in engine oils and lubricants.
How was yesterday?
You've got to learn badly.
We can't fire them anyway.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got you, right?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary was going to enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running up to me.
Tom now looks very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've folded it.
Tom was calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I have to go change my clothes.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I’ve always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom soon lost himself in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still broke.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you snore when we kiss?
Someone's gonna see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally smiled.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom have liked that?
I totally misjudged it.
It'll be a little while before it's done.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom Ritchie.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her a little privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the semis.
It's not too early.
Do you mind if I eat?
They painted the insides of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use it with this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I'm scratching.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? - No.
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does time start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour before the event.
You were unbelievable.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird picked up the branch with the snout and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man as three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow Saturday.
What the hell did he buy?
Tom struggled to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do for them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
This is not the right time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom runs by Mary's side.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Was there a bathing suit?
His nose is the best thing.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's great. It's great.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
The simple question is where.
The bush is burning.
Tom's been affected.
I'm biting my conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
He was drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting really messed up.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's getting something done.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects to you.
Be compassionate.
Let's keep an eye on the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his hearts together.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go, change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that from?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
He lied to my eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to squeal.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
They'd just run into Tom.
Maybe I should help her out.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I don't have anything to give you.
They found a secluded beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little blunt, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
“Love is like oxygen.
That's you for now.
That's a very contradictory explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
He wore his shirt one at a time.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was very good!
Take control of yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm wearing a haircut.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom will go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what he wrote in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
He drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom nodded loudly.
It was Bether.
Tom started to run.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a while longer.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all showed up to her.
Maybe Tom'll die by Saturday.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was insane.
Lime is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself to be a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all cheering for her.
Didn't you see the white flag?
Calm down!
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
He had been without food for a week.
I don't really understand you.
Although I am a devout man, I am still a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
- Can we talk?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does the same thing as Mary does.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That’s actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you building?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm shot!
Who said anything?
Tom began to say something, but Mary sighed.
We met at Meana.
How'd Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York City.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I'm wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
You baked a loaf of bread.
The marzipan pigs don't grunt.
Tom's conscious.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's fine with that.
Tom might be coming today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Can you help me?
Don't make me faint.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, one more time.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom looks sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather like?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don’t think they have a cure for it yet.
Every member must be present.
She didn’t understand the joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Looks like it's not helping.
You have to let me pass a message to Tom.
Where's my bag of golf equipment?
Read these instructions . . .
We're not criminals.
Meat is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom did not agree with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You broke your keybone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
That's where I was with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was sloppy.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom screaming.
It tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's definitely insane.
Let's go again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
You don't have to comment.
Chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
The penguin's very sweet.
You're a fighter.
We are sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look awkward.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never leave the house for a pair of shoes.
I think Tom's a nerd.
Illness from a terrible infection and the ovary and flowed.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come to mind.
Tom headed towards the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We'll hang them.
Now is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believing in justice.
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cane cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the topic.
She really likes to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny and even terrifying story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
Nawaca.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom will want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the cup.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He is an ungodly.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we first met.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for demecs?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shivering in it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've blown your anus.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little muddy.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither you nor there.
The phone numbers are fascinating.
You don't have to have a defensive attitude.
This is the best pizza in town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
