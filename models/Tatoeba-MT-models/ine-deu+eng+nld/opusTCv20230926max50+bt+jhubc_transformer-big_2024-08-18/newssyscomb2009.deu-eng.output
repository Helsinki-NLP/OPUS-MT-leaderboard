Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, in total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to the preliminary results of the preliminary parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
In contrast, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the head of state in Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially with the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both Union right-wing populist parties - the Libertarians (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received 18 percent of the votes before, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> received eleven percent of the votes - at the same time the Social Democrats gave expression to their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the FP<0xC3><0x96> had been divided from one party in 2005).
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and is starting from a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics, is obviously relying on this development.
The Greens also moved into parliament, but suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have mastered the four-percent ambition and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem with the Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India cannot be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that Czech-Indian relations could cool down somewhat.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clarified, then for sure, then there is a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that was held on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the indictment and received a fine, the central government wanted to cooperate with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be clarified," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could then ask for his release on bail and wait for his sentence in freedom, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the convicted persons "competent legal support" provided, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech Press Agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he has received a pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister shrugged.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judge decides about the ringing around the seabed
It is followed by an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the 30 staff members of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it to and from.
There is a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed contains a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, furthermore, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The coastal states today vehemently announced their claim to the new marine areas.
Under a UN convention, they are using their rights, which they agreed to in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches to the sea up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its soles that represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five proposals from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently met by the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its marine areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be of inestimable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their proposals.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold-digging country," says director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, as well as the investors of a few less states, granted the status of a so-called "breakthrough investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"Fördering can be done there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich find of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretization as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous scheme that brought the legend of the Golem to life.
German special forces were on site during hostage release
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
The circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the air force staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Unit were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation, according to ministry spokesmen on Monday evening.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
Initially, there was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of Congress has nearly failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones roared into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on lawmakers to approve the plan, even though it was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones crashed by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
He recovered just before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts are now anticipating further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the program requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire to travel remains undiminished, according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of travel agencies for October amounted to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results are figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates it for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV reported.
Here, the booking increase is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local areas of the Germans, are particularly sought after destinations.
Package trips in particular are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are "better to calculate for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be a turnover increase compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer from litre-pots and celebrities in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a bespoke Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling on us and snapping the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Wurst Quartet, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvested my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had tied the apron wrongly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, pardoned right, widowed back."
Secretly, I froze the loop from the back to the left.
"Shut up," she said, laughing.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats with "To drunk to get dressed!" on them, stretching the bare back of a naked man unintentionally.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "oooo".
He tells me this after he has gotten rid of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, which everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, medical workers run across the detention center to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the rudder - every four at a time drag a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty back, full back.
You can't see who's under the plane in the Promille Sarg.
"These are the ones where goarnimmer pack," one of the sanitizers called to me on request and disappeared in the mud.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of light driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in invading deeply into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits idly at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building collapsed.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a scavenger in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans paralyzed during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely transitioned from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the equal footing of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main ACP office, a custom-built, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
You'd have to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I asked, “Turkey might be forced to make a decision?”
“Turkey,” he said, “would not have to face this decision.”
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely renounced: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, so the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel on those flat railways eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German dominions, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey’s hands.
And when I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (pronounced 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chorus.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was meant for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and was solely due to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never subsided for years.
How often did death keep us from "letting the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
Sing it!"
His way of directing was absolutely clear and precise, never overpowering but never overpowering.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one — often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He denounced conductors who, according to him, simply "housed one or two known sheep horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your affidavit for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA, and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they exude, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-sized limousine offers an even larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the impending revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz had appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while a Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to disguise the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the brand’s leaders hope to close the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That’s 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-liter gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional features such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
<0x60>Car-bees' that avoid collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was this time inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Technical Development Center developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-layer safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is translated directly into a signal to avoid collision
The moment an obstacle is spotted, the small robot will mimic the bee’s flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90 degrees or even greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not deviate either upwards or downwards, but also not overhead; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs a couple of seconds to process the information and act on that information.
It does not require storing the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs or even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the next ten years at the production cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide you to your destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She is shaking before being charged with a mortgage.
One has to realize that the U.S. Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent U.S. citizens from getting involved in mortgage histories of supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers was developed: “Bad Credit Hotel,” it says.
Or maybe the “hotel of bad credit” or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times about whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Sure, she has useful information, but no details.
This is more of a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley stock at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the stock's price value on August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current exchange rate.
However, the Morgan Stanley stock fell by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which should allow it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms and conditions presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” MUFG Managing Director Toshihide Mizuno said in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will pay off with a reduction in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in a year if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, his balance sheet had “significantly” decreased.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch their stock market price fall by half as the price of insolvency insurance accelerated to the level.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, in part, from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the Republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
According to the public results of 80% of the vote, 64% voted ‘yes’ in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% agreed with ‘no’, 7% of ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be passed, one vote must be obtained by more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for “yes” and predicted him 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa, by the way, had demanded the victory of his draft constitution.
The “constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the Observer Order of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the president is advocating.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy, leaving it the sole right to “development planning” in a country that largely lives off the oil production by foreign companies and the currencies that send expats to the country.
The project, which is driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the president has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for 11 days, were safely and unharmed returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign neighborhood of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all the "best health" and the kidnappers "were not paid ransom," Egypt's tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the pitch.
After being captured on 19 September during an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding place to the next.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is now, about the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence and special forces,” he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a ground vehicle during a patrol, in which the kidnappers were located, six of whom were killed, including the leader from Chad, and two arrested.
The army stated that they would be in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which immediately disputed this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central issue of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums given to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that protect our cultural heritage effectively?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the Constitution of our American neighbors, it is written that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all districts of government, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history societies strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few grosques, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when funders and decision makers drop their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments National Parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Banking and Insurance Institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the ongoing international financial market crisis in a year, so decisions that are now being taken in relation to the bank could be precedent-setting.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares began a steep downhill run last week, with serious crisis scenarios already set in in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to management, the $700 billion costly U.S. bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the downturn in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
No panic has broken out among customers so far, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken coop
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox the chickens," Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription data tracking program, quoted the Washington Post as saying.
Insurances determine the fees as well as the payout amounts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: using the customer's identification number, he retrieves the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, that is, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies only need to do more paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the insurer’s point of view, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the query and processing of the data have formed their own companies, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling its use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject can hardly forbid access to his data, since insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are just kind of left to the grace of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic among other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic major power that should be given more votes and the right to speak on international issues, the member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase it to well over 100 billion euros.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that in the future air transport will also be promoted.
India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as well as the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be addressed, and both sides support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders are expected to be placed on French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency reports, the agreement is expected to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the whole, but in particular in the adult and youth section.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's Missing Small Plane Reunited A Year Ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane, however.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a troop has been dispatched. Now we are certain that it is the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (NTSB) noted that just hours after the aircraft was sighted, a team was dispatched to identify the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett in Yerington, Nevada, began a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were also found in California, near the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he circled the world in a single non-stop flight by plane.
Among his numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A SUV that, due to its original design and special line guidance, the discharge surface and its clear angles, falls out of the conventional schemes.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector.
Precisely because of its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from October 17 in the Mercedes-Benz showroom.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
The new Glk is then illuminated in all its details at different moments using the Elumina8 technology to reassemble it as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes’s intention with this ad is to introduce a new kind of auto advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, to be honest, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were among these in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had been provided with 144 cards for the game: all were issued with names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was found with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been charged in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can count on a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitations that could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be put out immediately, and that such behavior does not in any case give the possibility of justification," the Viminal said.
That's why, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small nucleus of Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision), on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the intelligence services, which deals with the problem of the stadium power.
"Duce-Duce call and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core supporter of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their deed.
Until now, this group had been in the queue, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and what will happen.
But we are also talking about the whistles during the anthem of Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, there is a lack of education...".
