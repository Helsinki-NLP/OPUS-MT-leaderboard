India and Russia are looking into the possibility of a U.S. economic ban on the deal in rupees and rubles.
International Desk: Today, India and Russia have reached agreement on the S-400 Defense Missile System between the U.S.-backed chemists.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is in the process of paving the way between the two countries by taking the U.S. dollar for the payment of the deal.
Sources claim that in view of the possibility of an economic ban on the part of the United States, India and Russia are looking for the possibility of doing this deal in rubles and rubles.
The U.S. banned China during its time in China.
It is worth noting that in September, Russia traded S-400 missiles with China.
Following the deal, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to impose a ban on China.
Due to this ban, it was almost impossible to buy a missile using the U.S. dollar for China.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to establish its currency yuan as a international currency in comparison to the dollar.

Earlier, the INS Chakra repair deal, which was taken on a lease from Russia, was hit by an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia due to a U.S. ban.
The economic analyst argues that to get out of such a situation, India should exercise the deal by using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international stamp.

When the wall of his basement collapsed, he collapsed with a secret door while repairing it.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a city thousands of years old hidden within the land.

There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city from here.
There is a huge door here, which is designed to stop the intruders in the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed in different ways.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 AD in the time of the Byzantines so that the people could be safe in the war and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Byzantines.
It's become a tourist attraction:
Derrynkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.

The truth was revealed in the post-mortem report of the birds

The police said it was a way to escape.
"Gilbert police said that it is not possible to stop the birds from eating fruit.
In this way, people have been told how to save themselves.

How can the regular language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, a devotee of Somnath temple and a common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, the research of the historian of the University of Delhi, Professor Shanta Pandey, has shown that Gazni's official language was Sanskrit.
Just when the Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only the idiom that was only the supremacy of Swabhava Swabhava, the supreme Brahman.
Mumbai's Pandit Slave Dastagir Birajdar was commemorated.

Ku + Ran means the sound or teaching that is heard on the earth of the messenger.
Not only did he attend the Solapur High School, but he is also one of the great Sanskrit scholars of the country who is now considered to be a vassal.
However, Sav did not seek to be defined as a Sanskrit pandit in the United States or other countries in order to market his life.
The Princess of Thailand is a pantheon of Sanskrit.
There is a Sanskrit version of itself.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the United States, enthusiasts have to go to the Bonn University of Germany.

Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who is also a proponent of the national language, is one of the most astonishing members of the Constitution, including some Muslim and South Indian constituencies.
On September 13, 1949, when the English language against Hindi was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on the issue of the national language, Sanskrit was proposed by Nayab Abhi, Minister of External Affairs of India, Dr. Nayab Abhi.
The discussion of that day and that earlier, in view of the report published in the "National Herald" of September 11, 1949, is an estimate of the profanity of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, even today, we have not been able to determine a national language.
Twenty-two Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as Raj language (official language), but the national language (national language) is not the only one.
According to the 2011 population census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country, and we have placed Sanskrit in a position like the Ganthia of Shobha.

In the relevant chapter of his book, it has been turned over to Sanskrit and the scholars of the world have detailed what importance Sanskrit has been denied: "Chek 1874 is the sabbath of Aqabat," said Sir William Johnson of Sanskrit.
It is fuller than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more learned than both of them.

At present, Sanskrit is the only language to be sworn in by members like Union Minister Smriti Iran as a member of Parliament.
We need to make the year of Sanskrit come alive again and make it a language of life.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived in Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only if there is a serious effort to make it appear or synthesized rather than a logical effort to make it into a language.
