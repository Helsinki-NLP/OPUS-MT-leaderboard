Members of the Welsh Assembly fear 'passing through Marretas'
There is some consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Wales Parliament Members).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Wales Parliament".
Some members of this House, coming from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them laugh.
A Labour MP said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "fouls".
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as "Wales Parliament".
On the question of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Wales MPs", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly raised objections to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin are ringing at a time when the churches of Harlem are fighting for survival.
“From a historical perspective, the elderly people I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“The bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of heritage will not last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return to exactly the starting point.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not give support to the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was then occupied by a black congregation carrying out their worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major commercial street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the lane.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the lane "the bells of the poor."
The specialist who played the lane in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first lane in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest lane in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it "would seek to pass on its costs", displeased that it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teenager During Lobster Hunting Dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster-hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, then rowing in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized the boy was shouting "I've been bitten!"
I've been bitten!
The entire area of the clavicle was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical care.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities closed access from Point Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department stores-style cosmetics, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion apparel and household items decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be implemented in more stores next year.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand on the part of supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product catalog with the offering of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products comply with vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily amounts in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health products stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 point-of-sale pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and convenient locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'Furious' After Holly Willoughby Quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of homeware and Truly accessories.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones alive as she left the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones became "angry" when the golden TV girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (whose value may amount to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) implied that she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely astounded.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the hefty investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays in launching.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that “We don’t intend to comment on your business.”
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump said in his pretentious voice of “newspaper master.”
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, saying it would be a major step in North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke in relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia wreak havoc on an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clear that they are not requesting international aid; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent absence of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, ill-fated by the expiration of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made improving decrepit infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, funding shortages have hit Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot to the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are advancing as far as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the gap after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that play, the blues forward gave a heel back pass to Mateo Kovacic before demarking near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
Then he made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the second-bar net with a left-footed goal that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said earlier Sunday.
There are reports that a large number of people are trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation was initiated after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, after a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to witness something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with apron cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to access his apartment, but has been informed by police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly claims that "it's so horrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone who has information to contact by DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the most recent monument swallowed by the contention of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls the perpetration by the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current debate about the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and celebration.”
Swine Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery and covered in blood, near a stall in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reads the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring shed.
In that poultice, he said, was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to astonish the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as a “stimulus.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire Mexican north and southwest of the U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, the Rosa caused bursts of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean moving to the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northwards into the southwestern U.S. zone.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At this time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden, dangerous flooding, debris flooding and possibly landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwestern areas, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions is possible due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is highly inadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into angry rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring heavy precipitation over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small spills of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first wet season precipitation in the region.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can register strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools. However, the tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and extend again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm up in early October, with widespread temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the eye-catching testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with stations disrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, a figure Nielsen found on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audience similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave its strong support to Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all TV stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audience, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying his vote would be in Kavanaugh’s favor, the senator was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator remained motionless to look down while being criticized live on CNN cameras.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that he would have more to say at the commission hearing.
The cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event directly hours later, when the Judiciary Commission voted to have Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and harming the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Checkers Plan” for Brexit, saying a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the other side’s tariffs is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Detain Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a Baton Rouge Police Department statement.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, with police saying Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he had fatally hit Wayde with a gun.
A security deposit of $350,000 was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish medical-legal office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department said the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area authorities for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This forward, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we are constantly concerned about," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Catastrophe Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity from the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between Catalan police and separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally crowded with tourists.
There were also later clashes, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independence groups chanting “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters shouting “Long Live for Spain.”
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press reports.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia to become independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we’re blocked,” he said.
Although they won a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Introducing myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot a beast at the car.
Menga strike gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of only two in 18 games as Ibrox's club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference at a time when Gary Holt's team changed levels, with Hibernian second.
Gerrard's team, which remains homeless in the first division this season, will face the Hearts leaders with eight more points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their succession of non-defeated clashes in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the score well before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow managed to steer his effort away only after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's header on the beacon.
The house team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause trouble to visitors in the standing ball games.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At this point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much trouble.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another stop from Livingston.
Crossings to the large Livingston area continued, which were successively resolved, and two high-penalty claims, one after Halkett's assault on substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand, were denied by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Either way, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality demonstrated at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final play was little inspired (only once they managed to open the house team), constituting a sort of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is Ambiguously Accepted in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked a presence in the immediate vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and diversions for buses were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in Disorders
Six prison officers were injured in disturbances in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The disturbances, which continue, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m.
Special agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a inmate.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to solve a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (areas affected by drought may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s expected for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rains.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total isolated areas that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category.”
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the mainland by traversing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," the weather.com website reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south to Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of the Rose or its remnants is the very high rainfall in Lower California, in northwest Sonora, and in the southwestern U.S. Desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and food in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Detained for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton near 4:00 a.m.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock Area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The agents appealed to everyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “was a victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A confirmation vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president laterally referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
"That's why I'm running all over the place fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami; Number Continues to Rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, having been victims of the incident,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman for mitigating the effect of Indonesia’s disasters (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive shaking was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, one can see a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although he managed to safely get to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of World Vision of Donggala went through scenes of devastation on his way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin grim relief tasks for the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
Falling from the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who refueled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "raised up to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known by Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been dubbed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her participation on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one", for only Ye - being only a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Militants fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300 as leftist student movements spread across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
At a time when China is stepping up its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research spending in this area, said investor and area professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a global formal strategy on the matter.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it intends to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the odds of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's best-ranked American player. Later, he held executive positions at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology competitions as the Department of Defense Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify future visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I’m of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to PhDs in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Name
Macedonians went to vote on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the new name proposal, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter for the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change of the country’s name, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads upright and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure lower than the required influx.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major mishap in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all the defense of Brighton towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling knocked out Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the midfield at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between Brighton's three defenses before cutting to reach the open field.
It was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing in the race more others on the edge of the large area of Brighton.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The forward used his first touch on the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in the territory of Brighton in this game.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead from a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “They’re watching this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they’re watching it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary. Do you see the evil, the depravity?
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, mean, sordid and lying."
The president referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as he received audible cheers from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the leak of the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
He is intolerant of those who openly give his opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was the subject of a similar treatment because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local labour representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever came true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to take a turnaround and to take positions that I would never agree with - whether they were on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social media that call for “dismissal,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down in front of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advices over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that thus “it would be all right” for me.
But that’s not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as a mayor or as a minister in the government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of "dismissal" or political expediency will stop me from acting in the sense that I believe is in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow delayed the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that made the home team lead the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr. They handled the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before immediately before halftime, having scored and then converted a solo rehearsal to put the score on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from Maca to abroad and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
The Ayr captain in training, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted Bruce Colvine rehearsal at the end of an intense pressure surge.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind Ayr's advancing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth rehearsal of the house team.
Still Game Star Ready for a New Career in the Restoration Business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the catering industry after learning he has been appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor represents Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and participates in with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, to debut soon, will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was planning to get involved in the "blossoming Glasgow restaurant business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue-marine flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive, as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ sentence pronounced on giant screens scattered across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the president said in a statement last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s verdict is pronounced only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy in stalemate, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set stunned at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide flap similar to a feather that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-covered watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, though they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, with tube and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you are in luck.
Stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social media sent another great creation to the catwalks: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the bathing suit model that carried it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia stripes and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Competencies Are Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, having this trend continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest utilization rates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now treated in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% concerned the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit proportion, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language learning is important for today’s children.
Multilingualism, particularly in developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for fans who want to see LeBron James kick off at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will participate in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump’s rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conforming vote pending for his Supreme Court nominee, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, who has been appointed to the Supreme Court, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse.The Senate’s planned confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, gain some momentum.
Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week were intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congressional control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the hustle and bustle of the campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally early in the evening could attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a hand in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of impetus is a fully invented sporting concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impetus will come now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re looking at it as a bit of a boost, I’d say,” Spieth said as she was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, with four points ahead and 12 more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural partying screams became louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the game in the 15th produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team remains in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and can't go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to hit on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win at sunrise at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, this morning's fourballs hero, when teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine stuck the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to coming out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage in the final day. However, this foursome session also demonstrated that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty reaching the four-point classification at Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a failed American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the draw.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points in the singles on Sunday the 12th to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duo to earn four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself for two games on Saturday, revealed occasional innings, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always lead the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the top men’s tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo won a bold 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point draw before the singles, though the title-holder Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its means.
North Korea Says ‘Don’t Think’ of Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating distrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as the discontinuation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled already known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant to the extent that they do not intrinsically reject previous unilateral denuclearization.
Ri cited a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, opposing even the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party concerned in this matter were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a calendar for it, saying “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, though North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “take appropriate action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were looking for were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all of its students to sleep longer, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in caffeine-impregnated “directs.”
One professor concluded that students at that university at the top of the world ranking often had no idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine to pick up to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattening, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home sadness when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at the Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win on their route since winning 1-0 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind unbridled Hearts, the leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the inspiring Rangers collective never seemed to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind the Hibernian by the difference in goals.
And there may be even more trouble for the Rangers after line attorney Calum Spence has been treated for a head injury caused by an apparently thrown object from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same eleven from Livingston who stole a point from the Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team strangled opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored just after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the average missed his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second pole.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the third final.
Sure Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a big quarter-hour penalty for his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak finish.
Although Livingston’s goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone because of its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with a long-stop ball throw from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the forward side moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to effect the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass after long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held on well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a big penalty when he got entangled in Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and continues to count ... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger accountant has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which improbable cow scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now it's really crackling!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still endures.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Harmful Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer," including those of the breast, ovary, lungs, and also colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to that involving removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump by putting on a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he began a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star cut off Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the West Bravat scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad bit behind the scenes because of the hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go in there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I would put on my superman cape, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments sparked public outcry and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a statement of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE TURBA".
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Allegation of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern Belfast area on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
War of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero’s stereotype, claiming that such screen roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-worker in the War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, also at 31, admitted that he has a "very strong position" regarding the approach to the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, “What is born and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not go into any prequel or sequel to the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and the horses" were over.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple made the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by one of her collaborators and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied allegations on Saturday that a member of her team had published personal information of three members of the U.S. Senate on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Liars, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This groundless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is choleric,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It has to reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We assure you that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Weak Spy Film Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and that seems to in fact apply to the new edition in the comedy and action film series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his squinted eyes and an overly elastic expression, obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for the Barclaycard, which left chaos in its wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter hugging a medieval armor, with the blades of the rotor briefly making a railing noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that editions of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers on Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the service agent’s dismay, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that makes her reminiscent of Theresa May’s character, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset are engaged, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And this guy is Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his aide-suffering Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fuzzy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from the catastrophe at Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously enchanted by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly disastrous acts: disguised as clerks, they set fire to a glamorous French restaurant, they create confusion penetrating as clandestines on the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but no matter how friendly and stormy, the ensemble has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And just like in Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but wonder: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers deny they are creating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day working week, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on savings with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an additional day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping it tidy.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day working week has garnered the Congressional approval as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favoured at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire shareholding of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to put employees on the company’s boards and create Inclusive equity funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who will be able to pocket annual dividends that may amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to watch performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true goal of the event: eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness to the goal of raising awareness.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters that have put pressure on it to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion related to them having already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. This after having received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the nutrition level.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responds: “It’s been a long and winding road – sometimes we fall and we fail.
But, like the great movements for civil rights and anti-apartheid that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as a “blockade” to put a brake on Russia’s energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where the legitimate government’s invitation intervenes, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to stop it.
"The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick magician” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at 11 billion dollars, aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, it is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic motives, being an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president in 2020, said the Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "deeply consider" the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running for office.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate leader," she said.
“After November 6, I will thoroughly examine the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s constituents themselves do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed a higher support than a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated over a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions post-traumatic stress from Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq following his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds that our soldiers actually come back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said his son and other veterans "go back a little different, come back hardened, come back investigating whether there is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner “and her children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” reads the statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the police’s ban on the entry of immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “dispose of the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a particular political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a febrile male baby, comforting him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of injuries and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replications that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake rocked him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Intimidation’ with ‘Advertising Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the state’s most populous newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, called a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariff vacancies on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation by publishing advertisements in our free press.”
“With the dissemination of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, in the stands here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have about their country’s worrisome economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that such a move could trigger a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no backlash," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease outraged voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby, given that Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford said on oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online”, or POD.
This may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse online is that it is up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all of their business models are turned from one day to the next.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: homage to cleric awarded with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only cleric of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unfastened a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the feat that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the utmost courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three detachment soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans wake up all night to watch the Bellator 206 instead watch the Peppa Pit
Imagine this: he wakes up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, in the end, is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover shifted to the Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after being up until dawn especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“Government regulations say the content is not suitable for 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule,” said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communications peloton, when asked about the broadcast.
"Fuck Peppa," yes.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said the company will adjust the broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning there and we won’t be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday at British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical error.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and exaggerated.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out in favor of gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the longtime regular host of the show, took a months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“To this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real motive that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he expressed himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "catched me by surprise."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar-winning 20-year-old, though she said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through so much when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all their perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: to dive in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - which he had identified with during preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson down in shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to regain his shape to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so often has been in the United States teams, the five-time champion of the men’s major championships divided the day between the role of supporter and work on his game on the pitch, hoping to rectify what ails him.
Having never given the straightest shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering shots.
And if the field itself wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting the 12 singles games, register a good start, Mickelson’s match can prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could claim much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, kicked me in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people and he’s a great person to have in the team room,” he said.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him again this week, which was fun to see.
He does a lot more than just play.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his big advantage may disappear at a peak
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that his sluggish leadership as he enters the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest of margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," said Bjorn, in the image, after watching the 2018 Tour victory by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday's National Leap.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the dots on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Fascinated by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be ahead of myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performance and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they are going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these major upheavals on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the cart.
“I remember all the words,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
“We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you’d like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this impulse is directed to one side, the pressure is too great in these midfield games.
We organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the first half.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the whole path," Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the newest Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was expected to join the Navy in 2014, but disturbing post-delivery issues undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy had commissioned in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from ports of origin.
However, continued delays have meant that state-of-the-art warships, considered a way for Germany to project power across borders, will already be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to Blohm & Voss’ yards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a number of crucial “hardware and software defects” that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It is also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional features in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros, an increase compared to the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems afflicting the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time as older ships were put out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spy on the secret life of bats
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered around the property to follow the activities of bats throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grazing, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affect dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is by them used a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspections to the dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It has also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that the same is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats that we don’t know, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us know more about what they need to bloom.”
It was emphasized by him the importance of checking for bats before making maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are avenging themselves.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” stating that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was charged with raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he would then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” the five-ball gold winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s all right,” added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where the player allegedly violated her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrorized by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret forever’ losing automakers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading manufacturer of cars after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production of its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production shutdowns at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive director at Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from suppliers in both the UK and the EU, for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also our taking advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it was not able to give an estimate of downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred another week" given there is still no agreement as to Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing the dismissal of the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was meeting at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not to fire” Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed the meeting.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We've analyzed those numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this frequently and they have seen that we have done it in recent weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre manner in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to costing applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, decisions are expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and almost fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie's oxygen in the side line before laying him on a stretcher and transporting him for a more in-depth assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no information about the type/severity of the injury” and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five touchdowns on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his season total to 18 touchdowns.
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to charge a higher stamp duty to foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty rate will be charged to foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will target people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent - could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by embarking on unused land, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "housing misfortune."
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and an end to “unjustified” evictions.
It also wants to give the municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant and the shame of sleeping in the lap is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeastern club, currently third in the Premier League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I just got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound programme.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if he succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he felt no fear of succeeding such consecrated names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the time being success comes down to 'can I take the club back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of the club, his place is undoubtedly in the Premier League."
“It won’t be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider myself successful here when I reach that goal.”
Ross's career as a coach is only three years, after a stint as Dumbarton's assistant coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself as more of a coach than a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face a lot of challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of the good weather and England's career in the World Cup, longer than expected, have made the June pattern, in which pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in sales, if repeated in July, but restaurants have experienced a decline in sales.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a similar growth that more than compensated for the drop in restaurants.
Pubs with a meal-based business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Restoration Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the prolongation of the cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector indicator for sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides their parents’ secret social media accounts
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, a study found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a harmless "main" account to show to their parents, while holding private accounts at the same time.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from its presence on the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute to help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped walking after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month since I suffered a stroke today.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have learned to walk again and I am already doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Milk Pump Ad Compares Mothers to Cows, Sharing Opinions Online
A dairy pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives to milk-mining mothers.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled job to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my boobs".
The chorus continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightens the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“I’m saddened by the decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born,” she wrote.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone even said, "An advertisement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious."
“I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy but it makes sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
In drawing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained peaked despite the fact that monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most of the "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their households would have to record their fingerprints, with data shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of godparents or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month from the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to reception center officials.
Many are present by video conferencing, and not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or attempted escape, according to reception center staff and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the children’s signs of disruption being ignored.
They add that moving the children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends exacerbates the trauma with which many are already struggling.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupation forces”
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions still displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “stop this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that have led refugees to remain abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for Syria’s reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in Idlib’s last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, paving the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness from the viewers.
Since 2014, prime time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the big news nights.
“This is a strong call to the people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has the value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion for immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it’s more than being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deep knowledge” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather blouse (“a piece of clothing full of insolence,” as the Washington Post has pointed out, involves the insolence of...
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.

We can't miss an episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He didn’t get off the television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Circle is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same seat.
The recent adjustment of the suburban circles of Pittsburgh put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th Circle, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles were unconstitutionally favoring Republicans.
The 17th-Circle race sparked a fierce dispute over campaign funding between the financial arms of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary election to the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional constituency.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador for Supporting China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked the Trump Organization out of the board.
State Department officials decided to call on the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific restrictions on visas, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead, setting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations under anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Studying History
The next bomb to be dropped could be legal adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will reportedly be guiding his investigation to determine whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, as he prepares to present himself again to voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stopped.
Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimonies?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With a legacy like this, how could you not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers will host the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season right up to the two-goal tie with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We faced the game with a positive mindset and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end but overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we went around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
"The last year has been very hard, with all my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there is a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the trainings are going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women Are Losing Sleep with Fear of This Savings-Reform Account
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of the type of care they wish to enjoy, few people spoke to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals questioned in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same topic.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to provide care if you do not let them know your desires in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choices of continuing care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Do you know how to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
"What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure as he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not imply a life-threatening injury and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly focuses on Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention center in Mat-Su, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smirking in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations after associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutions Call for Rare Capital Punishment for Terrorist Suspect in New York City
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and inflicted “intentionally” serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder at the service of organized crime, typically used by the Public Prosecutor in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notification reads.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York has not asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty to life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservatives' congress today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euroskeptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone said in the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have already left” if Farage was Brexit minister.
But Mrs. May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided fellow believers has been underscored by conservatives who advocate permanence, who staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to maintain her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, proponents of staying and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended "to end the Plan."
Bone suggested that responsibility should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: “We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally disingenuous."
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve of it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep the promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are prepared to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists pushed through with the message “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of Congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for 'more Canada', for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously weigh" the possible candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously weigh the candidacy for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican lawmaker Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top spot.”
Wayde Sims assassinated by LSU Tigers
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, after which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the scene, holding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior born in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was in the lead for 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following the team's orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxing and caused Hamilton to face the traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a fierce skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires very late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to surpass Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the box in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “more malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the press releases and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start with you?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no, no.
The escape didn’t start with me.”
Well, wait there.
The flight started from us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the Commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what else, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who they can hit, who they have to step up to take power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from their loss on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had made a comeback on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2–1.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the house team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first break in leadership, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Controller Dies to Help Hundreds of Passengers Escape From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to haunt the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower violently swayed at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the eminent collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, citing the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
The mini-markets are being looted all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing man after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after it reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known for sure what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and crashed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to crawl with water around the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby wetland improvement work also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"You've erased it from your life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscientious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to return to these roots and return the popularity of conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City Nurse Sues Couple for Dismissal via ‘Racist’ SMS
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving an SMS message from her mother complaining that she was “more of a black girl.”
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying the trial was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself to her first day at work in 2016.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE... MORE A BLACK," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she found out about her gap, an “embarrassed” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the previous African-American nanny and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day’s work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and claiming a $350/day layoff compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they cannot go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical since they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent him something I didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone they had mistreated, even by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
Calling the process "extortion," Plasco said his wife had been a mother just two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers fear readers might not identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s so much fun to hear this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have taken to his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when the feat is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“So Nad called and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart functioning were slowly failing and leaving her system.
He had been dead for a while and all his organs were stalling.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or grieve because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who were not under trial for what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post cards on bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old Lydney resident, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it illuminated the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had “dived into the darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards “so that you know that there are people who are available to help and with whom you can talk, even if you are a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you've got to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after his mother-in-law died.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with FBI investigation
"I thought that by having what I had asked for - an investigation with a defined time and scope - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, arguing that he feared the commission was "crushing" in the face of a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporal matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaker vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Deserters Decline During Kim's Regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1,127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers asked for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul has revealed that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants and non-refugees, and it is often repatriated them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization talks that are in a deadlock.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to be the first to take the steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse links to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a squeaky, squeaky voice, when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him a “grosque and conspiratory assassination” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton to have lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he has no standing to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she feared Kavanaugh's potential views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given her reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh outlined questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It is a justifiable diatribe, months and years of fury to overflow, and it can't blow up without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem strange to me, does it?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it continued.
And I thought to myself...it's brilliant," continued Ms. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office in which I was crying with inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman—an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little bit—and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say it.
“Never let them see you cry.”
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for the presidency herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, fundraising was short of what was desirable and he vowed that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the top—gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism—and tears sprang up.
“It even looked like I was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
"She cried?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the separation of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant aggravation of the situation with new rates affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will waver in the near future.
Making Washington retreat would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its strengths, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision from Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Prepared for Refugees’ Return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since winning the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe once again crowned itself victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to be in serious trouble for almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England’s Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He gives the floor to his compatriot Jon Rham, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
“It’s impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. national team struggled to get to the fairway.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
