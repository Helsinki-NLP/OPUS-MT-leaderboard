Welsh AM (Member of Parliament) is concerned about 'images like Mpeet'
There is a hindrance among some members of the Assembly to the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of Welsh).
The reason for this is that the Welsh Parliament is planned to change the name of the Assembly.
All AMs involved in politics are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour AM said that "it should not be linked to Twp and Pwp" his group was concerned about this.
For readers living outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A plaid AM said the whole group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independently thinking" about the name change, but it noted that the MWP could be verbally masqueraded by making small changes to the words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in Yorkshire English is pronounced.
With regard to the name change, the Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legal draft, said: "What the members of the Assembly are called upon to say, the final decision of any ombudsman in this regard will certainly be his own case for the members."
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission recounted the results of the public consultation on the proposals which had gained much more support for the Welsh Parliament by changing the name of the Assembly.
In the case of the title of AM post, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or the WMP, but found the most support in the public consultation to be the MWP option.
Obviously, AM are suggesting a number of other options, but Presidential Officer Alin Jones is having a lot of difficulty getting general consent, he hopes they will submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes in the working methods of the Assembly, including the format of rules and committee systems for the ineligibility of AM, will be included in the drafting of the legislation being prepared for the changes.
When debating lawmaking, AM will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called upon to say.
The people of Macedonia are going to vote to change the name of the country
Voters on Sunday will vote for whether or not they have to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A famous ballot was put forward to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, whose province is also known as Macedonia, in the neighbouring country.
Athens has long emphasized that the name of its northern neighbor tells about its province and has also repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
An opponent of the popular vote on the name change, the Macedonian president says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the referendum have argued that the name change is only meant to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's clocks are declining due to declining churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, "For the things I have spoken to the elders about history, I tell them that before there were bars and churches on every nook and cranny."
"Today, it's all coming to an end."
He said that it is better to reduce the number of times.
"""Today's society is becoming different,"" he said."
"Furthermore, the neighborhood's living room has not remained like the one where people go every day."
For the churches, they are worried that the money they get from the properties they sell won’t go on for much longer, as expected by the leaders, “and soon that money will run out or later those leaders will come to the very place from where they started.”
He added that it may be that the churches have been turned into real-estate apartment buildings with people living in various ways, which will not help to keep the remaining places of worship nearby safe.
"""The number of people who are buying houses in these buildings will continue to grow and so there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of them will become members of those who own them,"" he said."
A decade after St. Martin, in 1870, the Black Metropolis of Harlem - the Metropolitan Community was built by the masses of the religious community before the two churches were formed.
The original white people of the Methodist religious society moved on in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious society who worshiped at the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was occupied by a black religious society under the Reverend John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, where the place was a major place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were put to work.
The building was badly damaged due to the fire in 1939, but after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, the clock began to ring here.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the hour's work "opening the door of fortune to the poor."
The hour-playing expert in July described it somewhat like this: it is "a cultural heritage" and "an invaluable historical instrument".
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first hour played by black musician Denisio A. Lind, who played a very big hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin in the past few months has become a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the common leaders of the church and the rest by religion-related provinces.
Westry (where the goods of worship are kept) became the right of common leaders to parish (the priests of the church) - in July, there was concern in the province that the province would "require the occupants to meet the sick for Westry". Even if the occupants were appointed to the Westry province, the Shilpa would not "complicate the sick to the sick".
Some priests in the area complained on behalf of the province for lack of clarity.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured in an attack by a shark while diving to catch a cockroach
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old teenager on Saturday and injured him while he was holding a cock while diving in California on the opening day of the Lobster season.
The attack took place near the beach of Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammell of San Diego's KSWB-TV said that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour, at the same time he heard a boy's voice screaming for help and then he came out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammelle said that at first it felt like the boy was screaming in the excitement of catching a cock, but then he felt like he was screaming, "I'm cutting something!"
I'm going to cut something!"
Hammelle said that when she saw the boy, she found that the boy's entire anatomy had ruptured.
Hammell said, "I made a voice to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!"
A teenage boy has been admitted to San Diego's Red Children's Hospital, where his condition is said to be serious.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills said in a conversation with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Gills further said that the upper part of the victim's leg was seriously injured.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities have blocked access to the intermediary from the Ponto beach of Casblade to the Swamis beach of Ascinitas for 48 hours.
Gills said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's Beauty Products is going to include department store-style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by appointing expert assistants.
Despite the continued decline in the sale of fashion goods and household goods, this good volume is going to join the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty market, these huge volumes of beauty products will be further tested in more than 11 stores across the country, and if this plan succeeds
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, whose purpose is to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its product offerings by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing products of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-sized stores somewhat faster.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also check out the special feature at Sainsbury's two stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croyden, South London and the second at the end of this year in Celli Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase the number of people visiting online shopping and local convenience stores i.e. supermarkets in shifts that reduce the amount of food sold every day.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coup, said that people like department stores on the outlet will come faster as the supermarket chain has more services and non-food laxatives than Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos's outlets in hundreds of stores and two years ago since it came across both channels, it has also opened several stores, making it clear that the sale of groceries has been promoted and the deal made more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmaceutical products back to the market had failed.
Sainsbury's had been in business with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end this jubilant business due to the way the revenues from the drug stores in its supermarkets were divided.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold Lloyds Pharmacy Chain's Selesio to 281 stores in the pharmaceutical business for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, followed by a new strategy.
Lloyds will play an important role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores as well as several of the best luxury skincare brands.
Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hix, said: "We have changed the shape-color of our beauty products so that we can enhance the environment for our customers.
We have in particular also added those trained co-workers who will assist us in providing advice.
We’ve built our brand’s scope to suit every person’s needs and attractive environment and in more convenient locations, which means we’ve reached an appealing destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones reveals ‘Narazgi’ after Holi Vilubi breaks up with <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV when TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to break away from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal on the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Billubi has absolutely no time for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was being compared to the Goop brand of Gweneth Paltro.
This 37-year-old morning presenter announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Billuby took a last-minute break from her alluring lifestyle brand business with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones - so that she could fully focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have shown that when the Golden Girl of TV on Tuesday took a look at Marlo, the queue for the queue at a tense meeting in the headquarter of Jones' business located in Buckinghamshire, she admitted that it was her new deal - which cost <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - which was separated from the queue at the queue
The business was being compared to Gweneth Paltro's Goop brand and it was being considered to double the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million given by Wilubi.
Willuby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones left the UK to go to his holiday home.
A source said: "Truly was at the top of Holly's priorities ever.
It was considered its long-term future, which meant that the brand was going to go a long way in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business, he said.
What happened on Tuesday, no one could be sure, it was too close to starting.
The warehouse located in Marlo Headquarter is filled with items to be sold.
Experts believe that the UK's richest star is likely to suffer a loss of several million as the firm has been able to invest a lot in products such as clothing and homewear, ranging from pillows and candles.
It can also lead to the end of a long friendship.
Billubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Stara Kappa, for the past ten years.
Willuby had teamed up with Cap in 2016 to launch Truly and was associated with it as the 52-year-old Jones chairman in March.
Baldwin's TV production firm has a 40 per cent stake in couples and Jones who are on vacation.
Billubi has now become M&S's brand ambassador and will be placed in place of Ant McCartlin to host I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to talk about their business case."
"Serious conversation, and then we agreed."
He joked that the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it "a different job from the president" and would become much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so much renunciation?
Trump said his appearance in the "News anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up on anyone."""
He said Kim's interest is in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step was taken by Trump at the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
But, nuclear-free talks have been halted.
After more than three months of the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Rey Yong Ho on Saturday told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's initial disarmament "has not been the beginning of a ceasefire."
He said the U.S. has continued to exert pressure to maintain restrictions instead.
In Trump's rally speech, he was seen to be very optimistic.
"We are committed to building good relations with North Korea,"" he said."
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people were killed.
Now our relationship has become very good.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - including completing the rocket test, helping free the hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops back to their homes.
At the same time, in talking about relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
Pointing directly to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It is very easy to remain president, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join this area, we will have about 200 people to stop them."
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake have left an island devastated, hundreds of people dead
After the earthquake in Lombardy, foreign non-governmental organizations were told for the incident that they did not need them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok is contentious, no national disaster has been declared, as well as a condition for providing international aid.
"In some circumstances, unfortunately, it seemed clear to them that they were not seeking international help, so it became a bit more challenging,"" Ms. Sumbu said."
Still, Sev The Children visited Palu together with a team, but it is not yet clear whether other country's employees can come here to help.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing Palu's situation and were looking into whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of such situations that are coming over and over again in Indonesia, it seems that there is absolutely no preparation for the outbreak of nature in this country.
However, shelters have been built for those affected by the tsunami in Aich, but they are not like shelters found on other beaches.
The siren of warning for a tsunami in Palu has been seen to decrease, no matter how much damage the warning is, it is likely to increase the damage of life.
Whether it’s the best time to go back and forth, it’s challenging to go between many of Indonesia’s islands.
Arranging merchants and goods from natural disasters has always been complicated.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombo that is far enough away from Palu for treatment and it takes at least three days to arrive here from the new disaster site.
President Djoko Vidodo raised the issue of Indonesia's very poor infrastructure for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But, Mr. Djoko's administration has become more dispersed due to lack of funds as elections are due to resume next year.
Mr. Djoko is also under pressure from the sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members with a Muslim majority have made the religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 homeless, as the Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using slingshots, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgeon mysteriously bends and equates with Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturges scored in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge, saving Liverpool from being out of the Premier League.
At a distance of about 30 yards, Sturges got closer to Zerdan Shakiri, at the time his team was trailing 1-0 from the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a long post shot.
His effort went towards the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
Finally, the ball fell out of the clutch of the KP Arizablaga and went into the net.
Sturges told LiverpoolFC.com, "It was just an attempt to get into that position, so that the ball could be contacted and taken as far away as possible from players like Shaka, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself."
"I saw the fangs coming and touched once and didn't think much about it and just took a shot."
After scoring in the 25th minute by Belgium's best player Eden Hessard, Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the semi-finals.
Before the ball reached near the midfield and reached the Liverpool half game, the Blues striker passed Mateo Kovasik in that game.
Kovasik reached the ball in the midfield very quickly.
Then, he shot the ball beautifully, leaving Hazard in the box.
Hazard stepped out of the defense and sent a shot from behind Liverpool's Alison Baker with his left foot and away from the net.
Liverpool will now face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face videoton in the European League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament has recently become the most famous monument, it has been re-introduced in ‘History’
Its expulsion would be ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's many cultural and religious artefacts, such as its Taliban, created by its hardline Puritan followers.
But, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues, there was a complete fear that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Neither an order was given for the symbol of the English Civil War nor was it made by Cromwell.
It may be wrong that Cromwell may have given up for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's finest representation of the 19th century is evidence of a part of the history of a statue that many still deem to be appreciable.
The Sunday Telegraph told Mr. Goldsmith: "Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps that's why most people still know him as a protector of Parliament standing against external pressures in the case of monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell's statue has remained a private identity in which one side of that division shines a glimpse.
As Lord Protector, his accomplishments are commendable and memorable.
The deadly pig attacked the Chinese farmer, killing the farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in south-west China, killing the farmer.
In the South China Morning Post on Sunday, it was reported that only his surname "Yuan" has been identified as the identity of the person, serious injuries were found on his body, near him at the market of Liupansui in the province of Guizhou.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a swine herd in Jining, China's Kinhai province.
He allegedly came on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market along with his cousin who lives in nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin died and it was found that the door of a pig-barrel was opened nearby.
He said there was a large male pig in the swine-herd that had blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to the Guiang Evening News, his Kazan, nicknamed "Wu," said, "My Kazan's legs were bruised with blood and completely injured."
The security camera footage showed that the yuan had come to the market to feed its pigs at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person was not Yuan or his cousin.
Evening News reported that the pig was kept by shutting down so that it could not attack any person, although the police collected evidence by examining the place of occurrence.
People of Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, rare cases of attacks on people by pigs have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their field, injuring the person seriously.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
An Oregon farmer attacked his pigs in 2012 and killed him and made his own food, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They cut their teeth and are very inquisitive...they don't have to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on Thursday witnessed the Supreme Court hearing of Brett Cavanaugh and the case of the woman who has accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual exploitation, which is alleged to have been committed in the 1980s by Chhawi Chaudhary, the woman's name is Christine Foley.
Meanwhile, political hurdles were also seen, broadcasters on Friday's last-minute tweet: An Agencies Engineer Bai Arizona Sen's regular program was halted. The suit was filed by FBI's Jeff Fleck after accusing him of cheating for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that at a high school party, Kavanaugh tried to pick him up drunken things and take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh, defending himself, said he was absolutely certain that it did not happen at all.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not readily available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting those who see in offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of spectators of a playoff football game or an academy award.
Nielsen said the Fox News channel, which the host had given a lot of support to Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the entire day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it was in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
People were very interested in the hearing.
There was a central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
A statement was issued by the Liberal Republican office after his tenure saying that he would raise voices on behalf of Kavanaugh, who appeared in front of CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, at the time the protesters were screaming to oppose the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
When they were being vilified, at the time they were squinting their eyes for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, "Come on, I'm standing here in front of you too."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
They were asked, "Have you been brought to power so that you would make many women powerless?"
Fleck said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and said he would be able to keep his entire speech in the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was advancing Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote to the entire Senate, at the time the cable and Broadcast Channel were still showing all things live several hours later.
But, Flake said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI will look into allegations made against nominees next week, which is being urged by the minority Democrats.
Fleck interacted with his friend, the Democratic Sen. Chris Koons, on the matter.
After talks with Koons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck liked the power very much, as it was clearly apparent that without the approval of Kavanaugh, the Republican would not get a vote.
President Trump has given his approval to the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British prime minister has accused critics of "politicizing" the Brexit deal.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics to stop playing games with Britain's future by making "politics a game" in the European Union and putting their full attention on the national interest.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa, is expected to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Right next to his interview on the first page of the Newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson was interviewed in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress his so-called "checkers plan" against Brexit and his "attacks on him" because of the so-called "checkers plan" of Brexit.

On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano and said that 183 times gas and debris have been recovered in the last 24 hours, according to the National Center for Disaster Prevention (NCD).
The center was kept under observation for several shocks and shocks.
The photos posted on social media show that thin layers of ash coating car windshields were visible in a neighborhood of Mexico City like Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake had come to central Mexico, since then geophysicists have focused on the increasing activity of the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were taken into custody on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the riot police, and thousands of rivals joined demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote to secede in Catalonia.
A group of pro-Nakabopush separatists threw eggs and powder paint on riot police, which turned the road muddy black, usually causing trouble to the incoming and outgoing.
The police used their sticks to control the clashes and also assaulted them later.
The pro-independence groups chanted "no forgetting, no apologies" for several hours, while the union protesters chanted "Spain remained immortal."
According to a local press report, 14 people who were injured due to the protests were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 poll, which is considered illegal, has been escalating tensions in areas with independent views for a year, but people with separatist views in Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters chose a very good way for freedom, although there were few who strongly opposed the vote against segregation.
When the police were trying to stop people from moving to the polling stations in the area amid the clashes, officials in Catalonia said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year.
The freedom-supporting groups had stayed there all night on Friday to assist the National Police to stop the demonstrations.
The protest was pushed forward, but he had to be forced to make a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Terminus had arrived to participate in the separatist protests with his wife, he said he saw no prospect of independence from Catalonia.
"Our best year was last year.
I've seen my parents vote happy, but it looks like we're stuck now," he said.
Even after winning small victories in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence with their many famous leaders this year, whether it was self-revealing or organising and perpetuating the independence of the polls.
The 42-year-old mechanic Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o Puig, who recorded the protest on his phone to assist the police, said the clashes between the politicians of both sides had been halted.
He said, "It's become very stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junqu<0xC3><0xA8>res, one of Catalonia's nine leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to go back to democratic importance and condemn the return we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.

Menga wins 1-0 against Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, Livingston, who moved ahead at a fast pace, stunned the Rangers, prompting Steven Gerard to take responsibility for only his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side motion had equated with Hiberian in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side stayed one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders' hearts next Sunday, who are behind eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers in the European League hosted the Rapid Wiena.
Meanwhile, Keni Miller's replacement last month brought the head coach Holt to Livingston's winning streak in the six-game division.
Livingston missed out on showing off his game to the visitors.
Long before scoring, Holt's team should have gone ahead, as well, Rangers had a lot of problems due to their excellent game.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but stayed behind with the attempt to score, then Allen Lithgo could only stay direct by making his best effort after slipping so that the goal could be completed in the header of Craig Lightweight.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in trouble on the set pitch.
And that's why he scored a big goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set up the menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, Rangers had strengthened their position, but failed in the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was far behind,
The pattern also continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on being saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow completely captured the game by flipping from the other Livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston Box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after the challenge of the Lightweight, one of which involved bringing in Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
An analysis of the "extraordinary goal" of Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont was inducted into Tony Macaroni's Arena
Livingston's extraordinary performances and results.
For any person, they were excellent, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
The way he plays and the personality has changed surprisingly since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to the way Holt has done since he has re-formed the team.
There were a lot of great players.
Captain Halket was a great player, he saved in a fantastic way, while Manga kept Conner Goldson and Jo Warle confused behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in rangers.
The kind of good performance he has done many times under Gerard, they were lower than his standards.
Their final ball was declining - they had only been able to cut to their home side open once - and it remained like some wake-up calls for rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's welcome at the Colony
When Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the smiles spread but did not get any benefit.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - whose goal is to improve relations with NATO's partner countries.
They were caught up in disputes on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an talked about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the most populated areas of Turkey.
Police stopped the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan - some of whom were Kurdish - also raised slogans, sharply condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
There was a split among those who welcomed the visitor in two-tier protests, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero and others insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Bicycle rider dies as a result of collision with car
A bicycle rider was killed in a car collision in London.
The accident took place at about 10:15 BST in the southeastern area of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street, a hilly road in Deptford, and Avelin Street.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him primary care, but the person died on the spot.
Another bicycle rider died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run on Children's Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.

Such incidents are taking place due to the turn of the road and the diverging of the bus and drivers have been advised to avoid going to such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured due to misconduct
Six prison officials have been injured due to a miscarriage of high-security men in the jail, the jail office said.
At around 09:30 BST on Sunday, something went wrong in the HMP Long Larkin of Vorstoershaire and is still going on.
Experts in fixing the disorder have been called "Tornado" officials, who are in a wing in which eight prisoners have been placed.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the scene of the incident which were treated.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: "The HMP has been specially placed with specially trained prison staff to remedy the accident taking place in Long Lartin.
Injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they may be arrested.
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jail governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the jail governor was treated at the hospital.
In addition, riot officials were called to jail in October last year to remedy a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked from the pool ball.
Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is at risk due to storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
There is still a danger situation in tropical areas after the storm hits the Arizona, but its full probability is long overdue that it is the same one that has created a lot of potential of this storm in the coming week. Much of the remaining potential of this storm can affect the desert south-west.
The National Weather Service had already announced on Monday and Tuesday that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Arizona, are located in the south and east of Nevada, south and east of California.
Due to the rain on Monday evening, it is hoped that on Tuesday, Rosa will come out directly from the whole of Phoenix.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950 have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm azede range.
Recently, the National Hurricane Center Model has estimated that there may be up to 2 to 4 inches of rain in Arizona's Mogolon Rim, as well, it is also likely to be up to 6 inches.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest are likely to have rains of up to 1 to 2 inches, as well, it is also likely to have rains of up to 4 inches.
Outside of areas at risk of severe flooding, rain showers can prove beneficial because the area is dry.
However, flooding remains a matter of very serious concern, but the drought situation in the Southwest has now remained, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rain.
"According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's areas are very dry, it's the second-highest category of drought," the report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa Mexico's market will pass through the California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of Hurricane Rosa was 85 miles per hour, at the time it was 385 miles away in the southern direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and it is now moving northward at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is now in the cold waters of the Pacific, causing its power to decrease.
Thus, it is hoped that the power of the tropical storm could lead to a situation of landslide in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by weather.com, "It is hoped that the market from California can rain up to 3 to 6 inches in northwestern Sonora, as well, it is also likely to be 10 inches."
Thereafter, Rosa will travel to Mexico as a tropical storm on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border in a northerly direction, after which she will travel in a southerly direction on Tuesday night in Arizona and southern Utah.
The most dangerous market among the remnants of Rosa or its remnants is California, Northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rainfall is likely, said the National Hurricane Center.
Due to these rains, it is estimated that the rapid flooding and devastation in the deserts are a threat to the people and wealth and can lead to landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump called Kavanaugh's trouble annoying by the Democratic Party
In a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, "Judge Kavanaugh is one person who has been denounced by the Democratic Party's ruthless and degrading strategy."
Trump says the trouble Kawanough is going through is the result of the anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleaned up the Congress for what Kristin Blasy Ford alleged to her that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed Ford in his teens several decades ago, while cleaning up Kavanaugh with a strong and emotional form.
During the hearing, Ford also testified about the allegations.
On Saturday, the President said, "The residents of the United States saw the quality and courage of being the best man in Kavanaugh that day."
To the crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "Voting Judge Kavanaugh means voting for a person who is the most accomplished lawmaker of our time, who can uphold the law and do justice with the real record of public service.
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the mid-term elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
"There are now only five weeks left, from the election that is the most important for our lives.
I'm not involved, but I'm actually involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are truly worthy."
Trump said the Democrats were on a "opposition and blockade" campaign.
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the first counting of votes by the Senate in Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunami kill hundreds, death toll rises
When a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died, officials said.
A festival was being held on the beach of Palu city on Friday in which hundreds of people gathered, when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave rose after setting in the evening, it also caused devastation, causing many deaths and their deaths.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Sutopo Purovo Nugaroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster reconnaissance agency BNPB in Jakarta, said: "Yesterday, when the tsunami was at risk, the people present at the time were engaged in their activities and were not rushed to leave immediately.
"The tsunami was not only the cause of the death of the people, but it also dragged on the ground wrapping cars, logs and houses. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami reached 800 km per hour (497 miles per hour).
Some people climbed the trees and defended themselves to avoid the tsunami, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres of Palu.
Photos posted by the disaster agency from the aircraft showed that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned over and collapsed and a mosque has also been surrounded by water.
Post-mortem strikes continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
There were 2.4 million people in the area who experienced the quake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the capacity of energy coming out of a very large earthquake on Friday was downgraded to the 200th anniversary of the Hiroshima earthquake in World War II.
The geography of a city situated on the edge of a long, narrow bay can increase the size of a tsunami, it said.
Explaining the damage in detail, Nugroho said it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the ruins of the dam buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people have not been found.
Nugroho said there was a high risk of fatalities and damage in an area called Dongala, located 300 km (190 miles) north of the quake's centre.
Nugroho said that the communication system in Dongala was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people are living here and its employees and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
"This is a sad incident at first, but it can be even more horrific,"" it said."
On Saturday, the agency criticised why, if a tsunami was coming in Palu, the information was not given earlier, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already gone.
Amateurly made some videos by a person and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was making a voice to a person on the street below and it could hear a terrible warning.
Within a few minutes, a lot of water began to come out of the middle and even buildings and cars were dragged along with them.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power problem in Palu and cut communication lines, making it difficult for officials to combine rescue efforts.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials have begun sending cargo planes, officials said that people still need to be evacuated and food as well as other needs to be met.
The city's airport has only reopened for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Djoko Vidodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It is very terrible.
Mr. Doseba said that the World Vision staff located in Dongagala have made every effort to make the city of Palu safe, the employees have been living in it by making shelters with tarpaulins in the porch of their office, they have seen with their own eyes the sight of this devastation.
"""When they talked to him, they found out that they saw many houses being destroyed."
It is very terrible.
Aid groups started work seriously to bring in goods for disaster relief, some complained that external aid personnel with special expertise were being barred from coming to Palu.
According to the rules of Indonesia, money, no goods and help of employees from abroad can only be taken when the declaration of the disaster area is made as a national disaster area.
But, this has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level,"" said Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross."
"After being told by the government that it's okay, it's a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in the rescue effort but that hasn't happened yet."
Even after the second night of the quake and tsunami on Friday, those in Palu who had not been able to identify friends and family members were hoping that their loved ones would find miracles somewhere, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
A woman was rescued from the rubble by the rescue team on Sunday after her child was trapped in the rubble next to her for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gandan Subando trained two paragliders of the Asian game to identify the missing people, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally depressed,"" he said."
Mr. Ghandan said the paragliding community started its work only after receiving news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, sending messages to the palu contestants participating in the festival between them via WhatsApp.
However, only the grey marks on their messages, do not see the blue marks on it.
"I think that means the messages couldn't reach the people,"" he said."

Rapper Kanye West is going to keep it by changing its name.
On Saturday, he tweeted about the change: "Formally his name will remain Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has kept his name for some time and will use this name for the title moniker of his eighth album, released in June.
This change is being made in his presence on Saturday night's night live, where he is expected to begin his new album release.
The show's creator said he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
As well as shortening his existing professional name, West had already stated that the word has religious significance for him.
Talking about the title of his album with Radio Host Big Boy earlier this year, West had said, "I accept that the word 'Y' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you.'"
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
This word is taken from Kanye, which means just one, which is just this - it shows our goodness, our evil, our delusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year they have kept their names Love and Brother Love while announcing the name.

He said that because of unemployment and low opportunities to get education, the youth classes join the criminals.
The U.S. should double the amount allocated to AI.
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI businessman who has been reduced for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is becoming more active in Artificial Intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research to be done in the field.
The AI has commented after several works by the U.S. government, he also said that there is a lack of overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year: Its goal is to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, let's take a look at all the other countries, so the U.S. is far behind this case, and we are trying for AI's next success," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Doubling the fund may double the likelihood that AI's next big achievement will be in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by the Houston Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, and is an investor in one of China's top AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that left the highest-ranking American Othello player far behind, and later he was appointed Executive in Microsoft Research and President in Google's China Branch.
Lee improved on the technical skills of the previous U.S. government, which includes the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who will be the next government to identify the next visionary.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help, he said.
"It's not China that's removing academic leaders, it's corporate,"" Lee said."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired seniors from the university to work on AI.
Lee said the U.S. could get help in its AI efforts by changing its immigration policy.
"""In my opinion, the permission to do a Ph.D. in AI through a green card should be obtained on its own,"" he said."
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) development plan.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds the people of the academic institutes in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations donate a lot of economic grants to researchers in the U.S., but not the work of teaching in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners of industry and academics, and the White House selected a selection committee for the manufacture of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, the DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next in which it talked about investing $2 billion.
For NSF, this investment is now more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a law was made in the U.S. that the demand for the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
The people of Macedonia voted for whether the name of the country will be changed or not
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, it is a work that will resolve decades-old disputes with Greece. The Greeks have argued that because of this, the Greeks have given the European Union
There is also a province in Greece named Macedonia, says its northern neighbor's name is on its territory which has made two names for the same claim and it is already included in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said that he would not go to the polls and exclude the campaign, he has cast doubt on the fact that the minimum 50 per cent of the votes required for this vote will be valid.
The question will be written on the voting ballot: "Do you give your approval to the agreement that will be made with Greece for NATO and EU membership."
Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters associated with the name change say it is necessary for Macedonia to become a member of institutions such as the EU and NATO, it is one of those countries that has emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for the young people in Macedonia, so they will be able to live freely in the shadow of the EU because it means safe life for all of us," said Olivier Georgijevska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
However, not being legally stressed for it, most members of Parliament say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed for the name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported till 1 p.m.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, voting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, out of which 66 per cent of registered voters had cast their votes.
Gozo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje, said, "I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe."
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorika and his son Enemy, went to Macedonia to vote for a change in the country's name, to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old Skopjee resident, was preparing a small stage in front of Parliament and was putting up chairs in front of the tent set up by those who are opposed to the vote.
"We need NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it by raising our heads, not through an agreement,"" Kavdarkov said."
"Our country is certainly poor, but we also have our own pride.
If they don't want us to join in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can be part of Euro-Asia integration by connecting with other countries like China and Russia.
Prime Minister Zev has said that the accession to NATO will give Macedonia a very important investment, the unemployment rate here is more than 20 per cent.
After casting his vote, Zev said, "I think there will be a lot more vote positivity as more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He said the "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday found that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will take part in the polls.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday found that 57 per cent of people are planning to vote.
Of these, 70 per cent of people agree to vote in yes.
More than 50 per cent of the votes are required to be successful.
If the vote fails, then the policy of the Western government, which was formed in May last year, will suffer the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced the entire Brighton to defend to the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling on Saturday defended against Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the historic stadium in Manchester City, England.
Laughingly, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
Argentina's striker was handed over to the midfielder in the early round.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he defended against three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a player who defended before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton Box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Eguaro, Eguaro beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan by using his left boot and the ball went off from his right and into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, "There have been some problems in Aguero's feet that make him upset."
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
The same thing happened.
We were lucky that they shot at the same time. "
But, it came as a result of Sterling's initial benefit to the Sky Blues in a Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got a ball dip in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball beautifully from the left side of Leroy Sen.
We played a lot of good games before sending the ball away.
Just before slipping from the hand of the game, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group stage match will now be played against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Cincinnati, Germany's Rhine-Neckar-Arena.
Sherlock Holmes wants to beat him by playing against Rocky.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no big reason to stress for any other start.
But, the ever-competitive Sketcher hopes to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs for the Rockies are still only a possibility, he has played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the N.L. Golgotha.
Rockies scored a wild-card spot by winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even we're not playing very well, but at least we can play to know that the crowd and the other team of Denver's environment will probably be for the highest-level game I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play that game?"
The Nationals still have to tell about the starter for Sunday, but are coming to hear that Shazar could be involved in such a situation.
Shazer, who is playing for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander stayed at 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be on the stakes in November.
There are now only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"""This is a very big election - I'm not involved, but I'm really involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates."
Adding further, Trump said, "You can take a look at this very, very horrific radical group of Democrats, you can see all the things that are happening right now.
In addition, they are trying to weaponize power by using other necessary means, which you know is pointless and pointless.
To get power and control they dont care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control to get them here, but we will not let that happen.
He said the campaign of the Democrats is "to oppose and impede."
"In addition, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrats you have seen and also how meaningful and bad they are,"" he said."
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he referred to the name of the Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, whom the audience appreciated in a strong manner.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
What? What?
No, no, I'm waiting for the thing - whose body language was really really bad - such a bad body language I saw for the first time.
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who say their minds are not worthy of patience.
When the workers advancing my local party voted to elect me, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I am the youngest of those Labour MPs whose importance has fallen far short - we can't say the whole of our mind.
My parliamentary ally, Jon Ryan, also happened here because he also raised his voice for social distancing.
In my case, the sensor motion denounced my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of economic policy, on national security, there were similar problems in Europe in a way that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders on.
"""We want all things to be included in the meeting and to be beneficial,"" it was said for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday."
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I saw most here that the Frieda Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
The sad thing is that many meetings today do not agree and or are promised that the politics of "the kind and good people" are really forgotten, even here happened.
It is clear that if the views in the Labour Party are different, they are not tolerated and it is decided for every consideration whether it is fit for party leadership or not.
Immediately after becoming Jeremy's leader, he started here, for the allies I had previously thought they had a political opinion like mine, they began to expect me to turn away from my words and work in positions with which I could never agree - whether this was a national issue or not.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - there are harsh remarks about seeing bad words on social media, condemning the politics of the Centre and telling me that I am not worthy of the Labour Party
Besides, it’s not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way businessmen work and am dedicated to those associates who always face sexual or racial misconduct, but don’t back down from raising their voices.
In today's political age, there are many disappointing aspects, one of which is how levels of abuse are made normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it is necessary for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the Broad Church and the changes in the selection rule of every proposition of “non-belief” or party have become very small.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to keep quiet, not talk too much, and then I will be "true."
But I didn’t come to politics for it.
32 years ago when I was associated with work as a school student, I was provoked to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to leave the broader classroom of my school completely, I am the government minister on the sidelines of those who need better public services.
I have never hid any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no person in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy post and any area disagrees with my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that is damaging homes, businesses and our public services, I do not waste my time and energy in showing my honesty to the Labour Party.
But, in reality, I have a message that is not for the Nottingham Momentum, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud that I am serving you and I promise you that I will not put you at any risk or political risk in my work.
Chris Leslie is the MP of Nottingham East.
Eggs 38 - 17 Melrose: Reaching the top of unpeeled eggs
The two late attempts may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that the Iron Tent deserved to win in this best entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are at the top of the table of only ten unrepentant sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, as much of a chance as he could get, due to which he pushed the domestic team forward and gave coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We've thoroughly scrutinized our game and we're still disrespectful, so it makes me happy,"" he said."
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "It goes to the credit of the egg, who has spent as much of his opportunity as possible."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort put Frazier Klimo in front of the egg, but the Warriors gave Scotland's Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagge.
With the help of the penalty just before the half-time, Klimo increased the egg, he scored and then tried to one-sided the 17-5 match for the egg at the time of the break.
But Melrose improved in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort turned Baggot into a goal, reducing Levee's five points.
After that, Ruridih Not suffered a serious injury which caused him to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game the Irish moved on and tried through Stafford MacDowell who replaced Klimo Gol.
At the time, the captain of the Irish team, Blair McCafferson, was given a yellow card, and after that, due to a lot of pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an attempt to the extra-man Bruce Colvin who failed to bruise him.
However, the host team stayed behind and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card due to Billa Ball's clime from the penalty line-out, MacFarson extended the egg from behind to the touchdown.
Klimo turned it into a goal after collecting David Armstrong's box kick and sending Flanker Greger Henry away for the fifth attempt on the home side by Kelly Rowe, as he could on restarting the game.
The stars of the game are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
The game's star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to go into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for a licensed restaurant company's director.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with Jarvis' famous BBC show, in which he writes and co-stars in the acting of comedy partner Greg Hemphyll.
The two have said that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it appears that they are planning on what to do with Kirenne after Craiglang.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the Director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source found hints that Quinn was looking to join a "big restaurant trade" located in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-prohibited Bolivia hopes the court will re-open the way for the Pacific
The Naval Headquarters of La Paz is being patrolled on a large scale.
The oasis-blue flag is being hoisted on government buildings.
A naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon has a saying here: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.
Bolivia's coastal area, which lost to Chile in the terrible battle for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they want to once again wave its message in the Pacific Ocean.
Now he hopes the latter will be able to regain his Bolivian land decades ago, as it is awaiting a decision from an International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"There is a lot of zest in Bolivia now, there is a sense of unity and peace here, and there is going to be a positive outcome beyond the hopes of the people here,"" Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kajalazila said."
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, they hope that the decision that will come from the Hague court will be in favour of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - Chili has been forcibly forcibly forced into the matter through the talks.
Bolivia's top president, Evo Morales - who is set to face controversial competition in next year's re-election - has also signaled the positives in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he had said, "We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in the interest of Bolivia - and if the decision comes in its interest, there will be enough conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to award prizes to the province of Chile, and it has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
The ICJ's decision is due to come six months after the final hearing, a Chilean expert in the International Court of Justice said, suggesting that the case was "not complicated."
Apart from the conditions of Bolivia, it seems from the last four years that it can come back into the old situation.
"The issue of access to the sea has been halted by the current government of Bolivia,"" Jairet said."
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement has ended Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision has been taken.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltz, who is present in The Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually speedy.
He said on Monday there would be "a lot of opportunity for Bolivia to open up new avenues of ties with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Calazilla has dismissed the fact that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicizing the maritime problem.
"Bolivia will never back down to its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,"" he said."
"The decision is an opportunity to go on what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear inspections will not be stopped until it has confidence in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Rey Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
Ree delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the other country.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of promises made in North Korea's Kim Jong Un's Singapore.
Ree said it was a "pipe dream" that would see North defeated by the U.S. to declare an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the concurrence of the important disarmament campaign already underway without the announcement of Pyongyang.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit to take place.
But, it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang are serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb as they do not want to jeopardize the security of the country.
Kim-Trump is planning to go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which will be convened by both.

John Edward: It is essential to have language skills for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the record of excellence in education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellence in exam results, strengthening personal and collective success in sports, arts, music, and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under their leadership, these schools are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting the citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector, which can build a school curriculum and implement it, we are seeing that modern languages in schools continue to be challenged as a popular and preferred subject choice.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you talk to him in the same language, it feels very good to his heart.
When we want to build a relationship and want to trust people from other countries, we think we can rely more on English.
In the recent exam results of this year we can see that languages with the highest passing rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
Of these, 68 per cent are students who have achieved the highest grade A in foreign languages.
72% of students received the highest grade A in the Mandarin language, while 72% of students received the highest grade A in the German language, 69% of students received the highest grade A in the French language and 63% of students received the highest grade A in the French language.
This shows that Scotland's private schools are cooperating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills that they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included as an elective subject in private school courses and other things like STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled hard enough to appoint employees to vacancies, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative for young people to have more and more language skills to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are necessary to work anywhere in the world due to the higher potential employment opportunities that language requires.
No matter why no choice is made for a career, if people have learned another language, they will surely benefit from such skills in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, you will be ahead of yourself in the competition because of being a multilingual person.
More than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey in 2013, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak a foreign language sufficiently and only French was the subject that 15 percent of people could speak and it was the only language that reached double-digit percentage.
That’s why it’s important to invest in language learning today.
With the knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, children will be able to get better opportunities to find the right jobs.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different from each other.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach those languages whose approach is towards 2020 and which are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Whether your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and will also find teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need for success, enabling them to move forward in the future.
It cannot be ruled out for the global business environment right now that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be accepted as "international communication skills."
The choice of this choice, diversity and excellence will continue to be given to the young people of Scotland by private schools.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIC)

Next week, Trump has scheduled five more rallies that include Tennessee and Mississippi as well as other favorable venues.

When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to see it online?
The time of Trump's rally to be held in Wheeling, West Virginia has been set at 7pm ET on Saturday night, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally taking place online in West Virginia via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh can give a Trump speech at this week's hearing, a week during the FIT probe due to allegations of sexual misconduct on Kavanaugh, the Senate has barred confirmation of the vote.
But, the main goal of this tense rally is to help the Republicans face the elections that will take place in November.
According to Reuters, thus President Trump said during the campaign, "The aim of these five rallies next week is to protect and increase the majority of those held in the Senate and the House of Representatives" which is self-contained as part of the Republican effort to
According to Reuters, the spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so necessary for his agenda that the president will only visit those states where the season of our campaign will be very busy.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Determined in Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally can bring attention to supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media."
It will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, having won more than 40 percent of the vote from the area in 2016.
Trump is stepping up his efforts to help Patrick Morris, the candidate who is behind the West Virginia Republican Senate polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said: "If the president has to make an effort to push forward Moris in the election, it's not a good sign for them."
2018 Rider's Cup: Team USA showed desire to compete so that hopes of staying on top in the Sande singles can be maintained
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon in the fourth session will result in what is going to happen in this rider's cup.
The passing of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in such competitions as when which player to step forward and which player to rely on.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
"While chalking up the day, Jordan Speith said, ""He had a six-point rise that has now stayed four, so I think we have to increase our speed a little."
Of course, Europe took advantage and went ahead by four points, taking 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the American thinks they have a bit too many chances left and have a lot to encourage, not only from Spieth's form but also from Justin Thomas's form, who played all day together and both got three points from their game.
From spyth t to green, it's deadly for everyone and is also the best in the game.
As his game progressed, people happily played loud claps, when he and Thomas went down two more points after two, the important pits to complete four all-squares.
It was because of his put that his team came in 15th position with the same screen, a variety that tells you you don't believe the American team out of it.
"You really just have to play great and take care that the win is yours,"" Spieth said."
This is what all the players who have gone out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, named Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are making a new history in the Rider Cup.
With different styles but better pairs in Europe, the four-pointers scored four points and are at the forefront.
On Saturday afternoon, "Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a bogeyman, but they stayed away from the bogeyman until 9 p.m. on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
On Sunday, he found a way to get a run and that run in this strong crowd and from this strong crowd as if they were beating players, and there is no player who could turn the potential victory of the European team into a loss. It seemed that the Sula would lead to a draw in comparison to Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is good that they are both in different ways at different angles.
However, there has been a lot of talk about the European Union.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for the hero of the game Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time their pair was made with Alex Noren.
Spaniards and Swedes made a hole in front of nine dogs and two doubles, before they had never even been able to reach it.
However, on Sunday there was no one there to help you get to your hole.
When watching the foreball and forecourts were very good because the interaction between the pairings was pretty good, he advised that they didn’t need to take advice and that they were well-informed about how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and made significant strides in the last day, but this forum session also showed that the team has the ability to compete like the USA which, especially in the Statesside, is questionable.
The last day of the rider's cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead
Europe will take advantage of this on the last day of the rider's cup after a 10-6 advance in the United States after a forecourt and forecourt match on Saturday.
Top pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead on Tiger Woods battling with two wins so they could get their match far ahead of the four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Bejorn took the lead at the European side Morning Forum in Hazeltine due to the misfiring of the American side, leading him to a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed a lot of resistance in the Forsam by winning in two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
To maintain the trophy's victory, Jim Furick's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12th singles match.
Fleetwood are the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari had started with "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, they are the second pair to have won their first four matches in the history of the Rider's Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the forecourt, he again beat best player Woods and American rookie Bryan Deshambu by 5 and 4 points to beat the previous best.
Woods, who was ahead of himself in two matches on Saturday, has now faced 19 defeats in his 29 matches of Forssom and Forssom and seven of Ro.
In the rest of the morning's fora, Justin Rosen returns to the fora with his partner Henry Stanson and beat another three-ranked world players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, in the south-west of Paris, on Breeze Day, there was no break to it from Europe.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set a benchmark for the American by scoring two points.
He won 2-1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter and sent Pauls and Rory McLareau back 4-3 in the initial two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Rider Cup when a team came back from the match reaching the singles by scoring four points, though the kind of need the Fury side had kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, after staying second-best for two days, the counter-attack on Sunday is going to happen, as distinct from their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'there is no way' would only be disarmament from one side that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations continued to impose restrictions that depended on its disbelief in the United States and did not show a way for the country to abandon nuclear bomb inspections on its own under such circumstances.
Rey Yong Ho told the World Body's General Assembly that last year North Korea tried several ways to "importantly benevolent ways" of dealing with nuclear weapons, such as preventing nuclear bombs and missiles from being used and testing nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs.
"""However, we have not found an answer from the US for this,"" he said."
"There will be no faith in our national security without reliance on the U.S. in any way and there is no way in such situations that we will initiate unilateral disarmament."
While Re reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about disarmament in view of Washington's "phased" approach under which a gradual phasing-out of North Korea would not only gradually benefit the country, it is quite clear from his statement that a
For the first time on June 12, at a summit between the U.S. President and the leader of North Korea serving in Singapore, Ree referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuke Tsuk Tsuk Tsuke Tsuk Tsuk Tsuksuke Tuk Tuk Tuke Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk Tuk
North Korea is formally demanding an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to end the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has first emphasized disarmament and increased the level of pressure from the restrictions so that it can vigorously achieve its goal, and at the same time, it has also objected to the 'proclamation of the end of the war'," Ree said.
"Resistance can bend us, such a notion is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that our confidence is getting even lowered by the constant ban.
Ree did not discuss plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had recounted the greatness of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon J-in over the past five months and went on to say, "If the party is South Korea for this disarmament problem and the US is not involved, then the Korean Peninsula will be dismantled."
Yet, Ree's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he told the U.N. National Assembly that after Trump called "Mr. Eville President" on the Suside Mission, U.S. Mainland was targeted with North Korean missiles.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage to be lifted for disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the bans would continue until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for it, "If it takes two years, three years, or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are debating whether Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The restraining order of the Security Council should remain in force until we realize without any failure that we are completely, last and authentic."
The Security Council has raised restrictions on North Korea in 2006 with full consent to deposit funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Rei at the U.N. General Assembly and then told him that he would return to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his previous visit was not a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said work had progressed, with North Korea condemning him for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
At a meeting this month, North Korea decided to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts "coherent measures," it would also destroy the nuclear site.
He said Kim had promised him a "coherent measure" and he was seeking security assurances that Trump would make a decision in Singapore and that he would move towards building a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a job that is comfortable enough.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year that is for all of its undergraduates who want to get into the growing macho culture by competing more and more with the 'all-nighters' who are fueled by caffeine.
The world’s number one university student teacher often has no choice when it comes to the most common things to do to give yourself a break.
Charles Kasisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Williams Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the effects of low sleep during teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
"I got a girl at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I say this every time I have to go to the next class next year?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
For the first time this year, students will learn about the importance of a good habit of gold in study-writing and athletic performance, in addition to improving their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the students do not get enough sleep every week for which the university is willing to start this course.
The course, which lasts for hours, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where the students will tell by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books what the effect on caffeine and light will be and will tell about how the lack of sleep is due to the lack of time, how to perform athletically
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"""We know this won't change the behaviour of the students anytime soon,"" said Professor Jesseler."
But, we believe that they should have information about this - just as cigarette drinking has information about the health impacts that it has.
He said that the culture of experiencing pride in 'waking up all night reading' still exists, the growing pressure on modern technology and students means they have less sleep which has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep well enough or not, making sure it’s like students’ ‘secret weapon’, they can cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – it also saves them from the weight-bearing effect of their lack of sleepiness because their brain protects us from stress
Ramand So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, completed his last-year class at Harvard last year in the creation of Professor Jessler's help course.
He said that due to the course, they became aware and inspired for the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that it will be considered necessary for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining a competing institution.
Pro Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to bed, as well, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ coming out of the electronic screen and LEDs.
Livingston vs Rangers 1 - 0: Menga scored against Gerard
Due to Dolly Menga's strike, Rangers faced trouble in another match, with Livingston's 1-0 win being put on the wrong side of Steven Gerard.
Ebro Side were looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in the game played at St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team kicked off the game as the manager for the second loss from Gerard in 18 games.
Menga struck for seven minutes before half-time and thereafter the Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to match the game once.
However, the Rangers have now fallen into the rankings and reached sixth place, Livingston has reached third place and is behind only the Iberians due to the goal difference.
In addition, after the object has clearly been thrown at the other end since Linesman has been treated for the head injury of Calm Spans, the game can be even more troublesome for rangers.
Due to eight changes made to Gerard's side, the previous egg got a chance to go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Levi 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and the way they drilled well troubled the opposition team at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first sent Scott Pitman to Alan McGregor's goal by late-off, they should have given him just two minutes, but the midfielder missed this big opportunity he found.
When Kegan Jacobs, present in the Deep, free-kicked, this kick went to Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, present at the back post, Allen Lithgo, could only widen the stall.
The Rangers got control, but in the final third they were more confident than they were in their game.
Sure enough, Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have penalized the quarter-over-mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed with each other, but the referee Steven Thomson had denied the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on the target in the first-half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with Lasana Kolibli's header and Twi OW Asia's strike.
However, Levi could go against the opener run of the game in the 34th minute, but no one can deny that he alone deserves this graft.
Even after that, the best player in the Rangers Deep could not beat Jacob.
When Deacon Galagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept the menga quiet to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swiped the collebellum for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as he slit by Winger in Morelos, he took a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line by taking a good run.
But, Livingstone showed the game to the visitor the kind of game they could really take pleasure in, he swiped the long ball with Lithgo and Lightweight after the long ball.
The side of the Holt in the final stage could have boosted their lead, but before being widened from the corner by Lithgow, McGregor stopped Jacobs from well-studied up.
The Rangers called in Glenn Middleton, who was present as an option, and he made another late cry for the penalty because they were confused with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let them succeed again.
Elmanac: Inventor of Geyser Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" schedule: 136 years from today, September 30, 1882 and the time after... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiser was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radiothermacy, Geyser invented a device which was later known as the Geyser Counter.
Geyser Counter is a major foundation of science, it has become the main foundation of pop culture, as well, in 1950 a film "Bells of Coronado" was made on it, in which for the first time scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can certainly hear the effects of the atoms hidden due to radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely popping up right now!"
"Hans" Geizer died in 1945, at the time he was going to be 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system
With a new vaccine for cancer, the bad cells of the immune system can be ‘seen’ and eliminated
Vaccine Instructs the Immune System to Identify Bad Cells During Treatment
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced.
Thereafter, the common protein for many cancers can be ‘seen’ from them and then removed and re-imposed
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given this vaccine, which saw her bad cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that her cancer of dementia that had been present for more than 18 months had ended.
This method can be used to remove and replace the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then remove the cells by reinserting them.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very promising.
Prof. Berzofsky said that HER2 causes "some type of cancer to develop", including breast, dementia, lung and colorectal cancer.
Patients' immune cells are beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia, "instructing" them to remove and detect cancerous cells.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA Hat denounced Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would also form his government in 2020, he denounced it in the studio during Saturday's night live.
After performing her third song on the night of Ghost Town, in which she wore the Make America Great Cap, she denounced the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"So, I talk to people a few times and they say, 'What's the reason you like Trump, they're racist?'"
Yet, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago.
The SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kawanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee has already done the work on him by Christian Blake Ford.
However, nothing like that was shown, a photo of West's denunciation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to blow West's laughter with postings due to the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he was threatened by going to the backstage with his head wire.
"They threatened me with backstops.
"""Don't wear that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
Besides, he also said that I was stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, “You want to see that wrong place?” Also, he said, “They’re going to make a play for my Superman cap, because that means you can’t tell me what to do with me. Do you want to move the world forward?
Love. "
In his remarks, he mentioned viewers at least twice and felt the artist of SNL embarrassed, one person told the publication in a separate report: "The whole studio was completely silent."
The West was called in due to the delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, a few days ago the old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller of the Ariana Grande had died.
West surprised many audiences by giving performances on the song I Love It, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West once again met with TPUSA's lead candy turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest people: Thank you for raising the voice for the public."
But, the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West Bus is there "what he told and what is absolutely amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose a person who took advantage (by buying my music or clothes or supporting my ‘art’) who, in my opinion, is promoting the wrong idea for my community or telling my community wrong.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, as well, also said that they were just "formally going by the name of Kanye West."
They are not the first artists to change their name, but did so before Diddy and Puffy, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy respectively.
With him the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lane and the late famous Prince of Music had also changed his name to the symbol and the artist was then already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington raises questions about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsmanship role in HBO's valentine midi fantasy series Game of Thrones as John Snow.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such a role on the screen often inspires many young boys and makes them feel that it is necessary to do such a difficult job to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married his co-star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Day Leslie, he believes he feels "very firm" in talking about the problem.
"""Privately, I feel pretty strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about Massachusetts?"
“Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems that appear on the screen?”
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he thanked the very male lead character for it.
He said, "What is it and what is it taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the street, young boys seem to believe that they should do something certain to be a man?
In my opinion, this has indeed become one of the big questions of our time - how can we bring about change in it?
For it is evident that there has been something wrong with the minds of the young men.'
In an interview, he also considered that when the Game of Thrones series comes back at the end of next summer, he would not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well, he also said that he has done many programs with 'warfields and horse riding'.
From November, Kit Sam Shepard will be working on a new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a cop.
Recently, the actor said that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was to meet him with his wife Roz.
I got my life partner through this show, so I believe that this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here.
Roz has played the role of Yegret, who is the girlfriend of John Snow, the kitten in the Amy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, new cases in China have increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials have said that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the changes that have taken place in recent times, most of the new cases are due to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to an infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan province, China's health officials said the number of people affected by the virus had fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex by the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is said that there is a lot of discrimination against the LGBT community.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's conservative significance.
Due to many infections of the disease, there is insufficient protection against sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be given access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that her employees had leaked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and "a way of conspiracy."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called the allegations unfortunate on Saturday, saying one of his employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on Lommaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by the pundit and website of the "ultra-right wing."
"Waters tweeted, ""Lies, lies, and much more disgusting."
Allegedly, the information given included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and two Senators of Utah, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch's home.
The information was seen online on Thursday posted by an unidentified person by Capital Hill, when a Senate panel hearing was underway over allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kawanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court.
Kawanough was questioned over the leak of some information from the three senators.
Hill says that from a conservative site like Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address tricks that identify the person who posted the source were said to have been linked to the Waters office and a Waters employee had released this information.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false,"" Waters said."
"Any employee of mine - whose identity, personal information, and security is being compromised due to these false and false allegations - was not responsible in any way for leaking this information.
This allegation is baseless, completely false and absolutely false.
Waters soon posted an online post to clean up criticism, which also included the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"It is known that their nature is not of the kind that a member of Congress should be.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not get angry and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has accused them.
They should stay calm and have patience. "
It seemed that the Fletcher Waters' response was being compared to the condemnation of Justice Kawanough's Democrats, with critics accusing Kawanough of being very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican nominee Umar Nawaro also tweeted about his views in the midterm election to lose the Waters.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal."
In his statement, Watters stated that his office had alerted the appropriate officers and units enforcing the rules to these claims of fraud.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told whether or not, and that they will be legally held responsible for all the acts they have committed which are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees,"" he said."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rovan Atkinson's Espionage Actress Wasn't Considered Too Bold
From a British point of view, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still traditionally seen and it seems that Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise reappeared in this revival of the same name in 2011 with English and Johnny in early 2003 with English.
Will we self-deprecate on the subject of how we certainly consider it bullshit to talk about the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English, an unfit person with a pop attitude and a rubber face at any rate, has his license to recreate base-legged things - which is just more famous than anything else in his name. He is much more famous for those areas.
They are definitely Daft Secret Agents who managed to show off Mr. Bean's Dash Clouseau a little bit in spite of his bizarre glimpse at Smuthi Glamour. They are a dollop for the Dolphins at the Cheetahs at the Cheetahs at the London 2012 Olympics.
They are originally travelers and are the international man of mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for the chaos of Wake.
In this new JE outing, you only get to see one or two good scenes.
I liked Johnny English quite a lot, which showed me going into a helicopter wearing a collared medieval suit and wrapping the rotor blade on my helmet.
Making physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came very low and seemed strangely half-finished, especially in films like 007 and Mission Impossible. The film brand makes itself complete as a component of comedy.
The laughter comes in such a way that the comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me and Bean I've liked more in Atkinson's Silence-film.
It has always been the case that there is a serious crisis in the UK.
The UK’s most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, on which all of the UK’s working agents have been identified, which can affect the work of the agent – this is a sad event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and quite annoying Prime Minister, they are already struggling with many political and unpopular problems: this quasi-teressa-me character can play Emma Thompson well. The script is not the right one, but the script to work on this script
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy has made an agreement, he will have to bring in someone whose retirement has already taken place.
In this way, it meant that Johnny English would have to fight with himself, who is now a school master at a Posh Institute, but an undercover operative has to work on the record by separating him from the undercover operative. The secret is to work on the record: it has some good humorous stories, along with
The Englishman has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's re-enactment of the role has been combined with his rather old-fashioned sidekick Boff.
Boff is now married, he is trying to become a submersible commander, his role is of the Jolly-Hocky-Sticks in which Vicky Paperdine has not been able to join.
So, in his majesty's secret service, Batman and Robin encounter some very big mistakes when they face Olga Cruelenko's beautifully-femmed Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes to terms with that cerismatic tech billionaire who claims he has a solution to Britain’s computer crises: the sinister Jason Volta played the role of Jack Lacey.
The Englishman and the Bog Fersal begin their Odisha of the High-Jinks: the Englishman sets fire to a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle the Englishman through the expensive ship of the Volta to the hawk; and the Englishman to the hawker, to the hawker, to the hawker, to the hawker.
The film has certainly been pulled all over the place for that final sequence, but yet it’s fine-tuned and entertaining, with lots of fun things for kids throughout the film.
well-developed medium-sized.
Besides, as I saw in the other Johnny English films, in this film I didn’t understand whether or not Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that is really according to his talent?
Labour has denied that he is planning to work just four days a week for the people of the UK, but the money will be received within five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a republican scheme, in which UK residents will only have to work four days a week - but the money will be received within five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's owner to give the workers a share of the savings to be made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) campaign, so that they can get an extra day's leave.
This will give the employee three days of leave per week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources say such an idea would be "greater" with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit the country to the workers.
The Trade Unions Congress is promoting a four-day shift in the week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official from The Sunday Times said: "The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to last for a four-day work week, which is consistent with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers."
With the Green Party promising a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not currently being fully supported by the Labour Party.
"""The four-day work week is not the policy of the party and is not being considered by the party,"" a Labour Party spokesperson said."
Shadow Chancellor John McCain used last week's Labour Conference to present his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonald said he clearly intended to regain power in utility firms from 'impersonal directors' and 'insurgents'.
Shado Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can 'cut' based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees in the company's boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, which can receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy "60 Minutes" Tells if the FBI's Kavanaugh Test Could Change Their Minds
The FBI probe into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed his final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI was likely to find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more glamorous than his South Carolina counterparts.
"I think, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that while I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kawana.
After that, when this accusation came up, I called them, asked, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, firm, firm, clear. "
However, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh and it needed explosive accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever he named, he could not verify it.
This is a 36 year old thing.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday will host the New York, Global Citizen Festival, which is an annual music program featuring many extremely influential stars, and its equally impressive mission is to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes at the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival. By 2030, they will have amassed tens of thousands of live shows to the tune of Lakshka, an extremely poor crowd
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international pro-party group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the program (except when you're not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), those who go to a concert will be able to become volunteers to help create awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.Becoming a volunteer, such as emailing, calling a world leader, etc.
But how successful has global citizenship been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free music program the right way to encourage people to take action, or is there just another case of so-called "clitivism" - people seemed to be signing a petition online by signing it or tweeting it?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing forward efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped global leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements subjugated by its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been distributed or will be raised.
The group estimates that the safe fund has so far had a direct impact on around 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrient, a partnership of U.K.-based investors and activists, who have pledged $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make a social injustice a history of malnutrition,” Tracy Ulman, the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition in London, told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, after more than 5,000 actions, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrience, which is aimed at women and girls with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, “Why do you think we can eradicate excessive poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Jennel Monay are among some of the performers performing at this year's show in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use navy to "block" Russian energy exports to create barriers - Home Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Jinke revealed that, including in the Middle East, Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in U.S. markets.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, in Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that our navy, with our navy, keeps the seaways open, and, if necessary, unblocks, to ensure that their energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke, a non-profit group, was addressing people attending the event hosted by the Consumers Energy Alliance, who call themselves "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran to the fact that they are effectively unified.
Referring to Russia as a "moveable tautou" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "In the case of Iran and Russia, it is economic alternatives, a combination, taking advantage of fuel and substitution."
The statement comes that the Trump administration, taking the place of Russia, is on a mission to promote its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unlawful" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, who has made Berlin a "blockade" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to select suppliers."
The U.S.-led Germany opposed the project, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "When a large state has given me access to our energy supply, it is not enough for us to do so."
"""Elizabeth Warren will """"seriously consider"" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020,"" the Massachusetts senator said."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the run for president after the midterm elections.
During the town hall in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the race.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes having a woman in the top position,"" said The Hill."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting the election for the post of President."""
Evaluating President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, Warren said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned from the inside about what Donald Trump is finally doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court nominee Bret Cavana have been vocal in their criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need to check with the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents do not think he should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, eighteen percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty-two per cent supported the election in this way.
The poll showed more support in the case of contesting elections by former governor Devl Patrick, where 38 per cent supported possible participation in the election race and 48 per cent were against it.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are among the other high-profile Democrats who are likely to contest elections by 2020.
Biden said he would make the official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
He was arrested in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told audiences, "I feel sorry for my son because of the time he is going through after he comes back, I feel sorry for him for my other families, who are suffering from PTSD."
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said about his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back tough, they come back thinking about whether it's the country's honor to him who has given to his fellow soldiers and airmen,
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A spokesman for the Wasila Police Department, Dan Bennett, was arrested in Wasila, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence and possession of weapons by a woman who was drunk.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
The eighteen states and the Colombian district are supporting a new U.S. policy of legal challenge that refuses to provide shelter to victims of domestic violence or fleeing gangs.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and districts filed a court-friendly brief in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace vs Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent gang members" mistreated him, but U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described Al Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which create a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal statute requires that all asylum claims should be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an impediment violates that principle," the Justice-Friend said.
The attorney further argued in the memorandum that the policy of denying immigrant entry is damaging to the U.S. economy by saying that it is more likely to become an entrepreneur and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to give shelter to victims of domestic exploitation and collective violence.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "For those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to membership of their caste, religion, nationality or any particular social group, shelter is available."
Shelter has never been to alleviate all the problems—even all the serious problems—that people around the world face every day.
In the course of the race to find survivors, the number of deaths in Palu has doubled as a result of fierce rescue efforts
For the survivors, the situation was very serious.
"It seems very stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting the child who suffered from bukhari in the Tehs-Nahs Palu exit centre.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is rare. "
Residents were seen returning to their empty houses, picking up water-filled belongings, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude quake and the hospital sank.
Some injured people, including Dr. Harvey, who were facing broken backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to sustained strong earthquake shocks.
Tears poured into his eyes as he felt the shocks of a violent earthquake in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed in the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, also telling that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then she was silent.
I don’t know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe. . .
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Threatening' Through 'Promotional Advertisements'
A week after running a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper, by the Chinese government newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, China's U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the U.S. press.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in Congressional elections on November 6 - Iowa's highest-selling newspaper - Des Moines is acknowledging China Daily's pedestal supplement in the Des Moines register.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters there was a new step in Washington's campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, which has seen them impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's first retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa, who backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the former U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, China's chief exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"Branstead wrote in the Das Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling that abuse by running advertisements in our independent press,"" he said."
"In its propaganda-spreading, advertising paid in the Das Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's fostered tradition of freedom of speech and free journalism," Branstead wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited dissatisfied voices," he said, adding that there would be no real reflection of those incoherent opinions on the Chinese side.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers did not justify his proposal to publish his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavana's defeat, Republicans are separating women voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warned
Since the top Republicans are supporting and defending Bret Cavana, the Supreme Court's candidate facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst has warned that they will watch the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiments around it are quite huge, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be brought back," Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at the University of Siracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rehar said he doubted that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior adviser to Progressive Group MoveOn and National Spokesperson Carine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, “Women can’t forget what happened yesterday – neither the ordinary can’t forget it tomorrow nor November.”
On Friday morning, when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the protesters in the Senate's Dalan have been protesting!"
Non-political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and inspiration is going to be removed from the chart."
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it can be even more, especially among female voters of suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters, who don't vote often when they don't like the president."
Describing in detail the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the nominee of the Supreme Court, the analysts had already said before the public testimony that there is a possibility of opposition to it if the Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steel, said, "This has become a messy mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about putting the committee vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about the matter of how the Republicans handled it and how they treated them," said Neil Cohen, the Democratic Party's governing body for the election.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the matter as to who to believe in view of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, most of whom appeared to take Kavanaugh's side.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed the Ford testimonial, while 35 percent said they believed the Kavanaugh testimonial.
Additionally, 38 per cent said they felt that Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said so about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford and, as well, at least one other litigant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath last week and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kawana had assaulted her intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee exhibited his genitals when he joined a party while reading in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet in the face of Google and Facebook
The inventor of the world wide web, Tim Burners-Lee, has launched a startup that wants to counter Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Burners-Lee's Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access what information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "global domination."
"We have to do it right now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it depends entirely on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring the company's resources, process, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of valentine coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change, where all of their business models will end completely overnight."
"We are not asking them for permission."""
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and environmental mechanisms to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Burners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee Net has been an influential voice in the neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Burns-Lee said.
Bernard von: WW1 Victoria Cross Clergy Celebrated
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard van won the award in the September 29, 1918, attack on the Belgians and the Leh Court.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at a parade in Northamptonshire's Rushden on Saturday.
One of his descendants, Michael Won, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that this figure was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award was won.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Won led his battalion at the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
Later they advanced towards the firing line and, with "great bravery," led the army-line before taking the field-gun alone and capturing three pieces.
Lieutenant Colonel Vonn was killed by a German sniper just a month before the end of the war on October 4, 1918.
Michael Won, 72, said his grandfather's caricatures were "something I know can never equate to, but which we care about."
He and his brother Dr. James Won also sacrificed after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Won said he is "feeling very honored to play a role in the parade" and said "the support being given by many people is demonstrating the bravery of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Pappa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the hilly Bellator 206, but were deprived of seeing the main program.
San Jose's bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was being shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as soon as Gagaard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the U.K. was stunned to see the cover turn into a Pappa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed especially after waking up in the morning for the opposition.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Balater's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, "This content was not suitable for 6 a.m. according to government regulations, so he had to switch to children's programming."
"""Papa the Pig," "yes."
Scott Cocker, president of Ballater, said he is going to work on his schedule to include U.K. audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we'll probably find a solution to it," Cocker said.
"But there will be six o'clock Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change took place there was a lot of text movement going on and not all of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was some technical flaw.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won’t happen next time.
We'll keep it limited to five versus six -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to deliver something more for the fans, it just got a little more.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley 'feels innocence' in sexuality case
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he was hurt by the heinous feeling towards everyone because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to be successful.
24-year-old Deli said she didn't realize until she reached high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that when he became a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
Regular presenter of the long-running show, Karsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing as a social-minded person in Lawrence's first show, Daley said she felt "lower" in herself than anyone because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
"Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was also "special," she said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any hassle and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - from when he fell in love - "I was surprised."
Dale married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and died of cancer three years later from his father - he said that at such a young age, someone who went through a downward spiral of similar experiences.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"As you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> said that his father did not just admit that he was going to die and that the last time he wanted to know was if he had the London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell them that you wouldn't stay in the front row, Dad."
He said, "When they were not able to breathe, I held their hand and held it until their breath stopped and they were dead, then I went and thought they were not incapable."
The following year, Deely participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew so much that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of indigenous people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first favorite song - the Poughkeepsie Heather Small - which was resonating with him during the preparation for the Olympics and which still stands up to his voice.
The Desert Island disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mikkelson out of the out-of-form rider's cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday as they play their 47th Rider Cup match, but they will have to change their form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial program for the 12th time on record, Michaelson was put out of the game by skipper Jim Furick for Saturday's foreballs and forecourts.
Instead of becoming a center of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time top winner spent his day living among the cheerleaders and working in the hopes of improving the weaknesses of his way of playing.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old hasn't been the ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where long-term inactive people are regularly punished by the wrong shots.
And where the course is not that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mikkelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If U.S. players who start out four points down in 12 singles matches, make a strong start, then Michaelson's match can prove to be quite important.
Furic trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, kicked my back and surrounded me in their arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and he has made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think I'd play two games.
I had more imagination, but it worked the way and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else."
Michaelson will cross Nick Faldo's record for the most-played rider cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a rider's cup career that has never touched the heights of their personal record.
Michaelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furick said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's captivating, he's a presenter, he likes to fly fun, and his presence in the team room is special," she explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch," he said.
"He gives a lot more than just playing."""
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advance could soon be gone.
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large advance in the last-day singles in the rider's cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his first appearance in the 1997 game at Walderama, where a side captained by Sean Ballesteros had achieved a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win, taking the lowest margin, just reached the finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Walderama; our big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderama, we just won," the 2018 class went from Friday 5-3 to the Le Mans Golf Championship, yesterday saw the rise of 10-6, to the top of the league.
So history will show me and all the people of that team that this is not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus has to be maintained.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest player in the world is on the other side.
Bourne further said how his players performed on a tough golf course: "I will never be able to get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a tough time.
Tomorrow's personal performance will come forward, and that's a different thing.
It’s great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there in person, your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players to show your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he also has to give his best performance.
Unlike Bourne, opposite-minded gymnastics would have been eager for better performance personally for their players who he had done as a partner, with the exceptions being Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Before Europe's "miracle-in-the-middle" defeat, due to being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Fury himself have been on both ends of those big last-day rebounds."
"I remember every run of it," he said in response to being asked how captain Ben Craneshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd want to make a quick start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in between.
We set up our line-up on our own terms and included people like this, as we felt, you know, we’re trying to do something else miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the retaliatory attack with Rory McLareau in the top match, where Paul KC, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had them grouped in this order because I think it covers everyone," Byron said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
The new German Navy warships should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-influenced Cold War-era warships, but due to flawed systems and rapidly rising costs, at least that won’t happen until next year, local media said.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate," which is the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues after the delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought in as a replacement for the time-influenced Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will provide a range of powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth techniques such as low radar, infra-red and audible divisions.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which may give Germany the opportunity for a power project abroad - will become blacklisted until the period of entry into service, Die Zin commented.
The rare F125 battleship had been the headliner last year, when the German Navy had officially refused to commission the ship and had returned the Blohm and Wass Shipyard to Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - which is only half the manpower of the old Bremen-class battleships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to add to future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of the same category used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to flawed hardware, the value tag of the entire project - which also includes driver team training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships that have become particularly important in light of recent warnings is gripping Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that in fact "deployable ships are ending up in the navy."
The issue has become serious over time, the official said, as the old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of the lightning rods
The purpose of the new research being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how the squid use the natural landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists of the National Trust of Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipstrals as well as long-eared brown and dobenton pips in the Inverve Garden of Weston Ross.
Special records will be set at key locations around the property to track the activities of the lighthouses throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using personalized detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings shows the frequency of the bat calls and what species are doing.
A detailed map and report of their behaviour will then be prepared for depiction on landscape-painting.
Rob Dever, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural habitat are most important for ticks and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-residential management tasks such as the construction of grassland and how to maintain the woodlands well for grasshoppers and other related species.
In Scotland and across the U.K., the population of Chamgadad has fallen considerably in the last century
They are endangered by construction and development works, which affect the bird's nests and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also become a threat.
The lights aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, when it comes to catching the hunt, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamgadar very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly inspect surveys, bird traps, and sometimes save them.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland's Dumfries and Three Estates of the Gallows, home to eight of Scotland's ten tamed species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for them to be.
"We have a great area for lighthouses here in Troy," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good natural habitats.
But there's a lot about squid that's still unknown, so what we do here and in other properties will help us understand what things they need to run."
They underscore the importance of screening the litter before it is kept within the estates as it is possible that 400 women and babies could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity hospital inadvertently, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Lizards are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their traps.
Bat Conservation Trust's Scottish officer Elizabeth Farrell has encouraged the public to come forward for help.
"We still have a lot to know about our lizards and we still don't know how their population is growing about our many species," he said.
Ronaldo dismissed the allegations of rape while the lawyers filed the suit on the German magazine, the source said.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him "fake news" that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
In 2009, Portugal and Juventus Forward were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Dere Spiegel said in a report on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to preach themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that’s part of their work.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer Der Spiegel is preparing to sue for the allegations, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspected illegal reporting in the field of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the players "will seek compensation for moral damages in the amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite of Las Vegas' Pams Hotel and Casino in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Meyorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Meyorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he is "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but there was mutual agreement for it.
Meyorga also claims that she went to the police and also took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "dismayed by the retaliation" and she was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to terminate the agreement as his harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: U.K. to lose manufacturer 'will be regrettable forever'
Trade Secretary Greg Clarke said the U.K. would "repent forever" if it lost its title as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota U.K. had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese carmaker said that a no-deal Brexit could have an impact on jobs due to border delays.
The Burnston Plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other U.K. car makers have raised concerns about how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work without the EU's consent.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini-plant for a month after the Brexit in Oxford.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with batches of Made-to-Order cars coming from both suppliers in the U.K. and the European Union every 37 minutes.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could cause delays and shortages.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be shut down.
Mr. Clarke said that the checkers scheme in Theresa May for future relations with the European Union has been calibrated "to avoid those checks at the border strictly."
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that in my opinion can not only enjoy success in the present, but also that is essential to achieving this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have given evidence that we should be able to fully continue it which has been a very successful set-up of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be shut down, but in the long run, warned that the plant's competitiveness would be reduced from the extra cost and eventually jobs would go away.
Peter Sauvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a convener of the United Union at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: "Once in my experience these jobs go away, they never come back to the bath after.
"We have advanced a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union," a government spokesman said.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for "one more week" as the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Kavanaugh's fight continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Muller, who is investigating the relationship between Russian election intervention, Trump's aide and Russia and the president's possible impediment to justice.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and which endangers the liberty of the miller, this news has heated the market of Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiretapping to record talks with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, they went to the White House amid the news that they were going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like to remove Rosenstein" but then was delayed in the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kawana and the woman accused of sexual misconduct against him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both attended the hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI probe into claims against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was spotted on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date for this has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that another week can be pushed ahead in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to interest in the "majesty" of TV reporters, though he said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they are magnificent."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more quiz sessions than any other president," he said, citing no evidence, citing "we've seen those numbers."
The briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do that and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States, he's going to take the place of the press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or in a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed off in front of the journalists present and several times exhibiting a unique presence, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to European Union workers in Scotland about the concerns of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Health Secretary has written to the staff of the European Union working in the NHS in Scotland, expressing the country's gratitude and wishing them to remain after Brexit.
The Gene Freeman MSP sent a letter to the European Union in less than six months to withdraw from the United Kingdom.
The Scottish government is already committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for European Union citizens working in its overcrowded public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the winter, the mutual dialogue between the U.K. and the European Union continued, moving towards the decisions expected in this cold season.
But the U.K. government is also moving ahead with its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to reiterate now how much I attach importance to their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and its colleagues beyond, bring with it valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie's Emergency Surgery After Injury to the Head
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who faced a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after a head injury, according to a statement.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reid, told reporters that the injury took place just a short time ago.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercromby on the sideline before putting it on the stretcher and taking it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the surgery had been performed at the Aberdeen Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "there are no details available on the type/limit of injury so far" and the Tennessee state is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is the Redshirt Sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he made a total of five tackles on Saturday, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
Higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when buying property in the U.K.
When foreign buyers buy property in the U.K., they will be charged a higher stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tori schemes.
This step will undo the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the U.K.
Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year to help the homeless
High stamp duty rates are being prepared to be recovered when buying property from foreign buyers in the U.K. - which additional cash will be used to help homeless people, Theresa will announce today.
The move is seen as an effort to undo Jeremy Corbin’s campaign to provide more affordable housing and target high-income voters with a promise to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on non-tax payers and firms in the U.K., which with additional funds will boost the government's campaign to deal with the gold miners in awkward circumstances.
Overhead - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes purchases of two houses started two years ago and rented, can be a maximum of three per cent.
The treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly-built London properties are purchased by non-U.K. residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to keep their feet on the housing ladder.
Many rich regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spiritual cities" because the number of such foreign buyers is higher, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of plundering land but not using it to raise property prices, and urged the MIS to leave quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain's "housing insecure."
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent control and "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give councils more power to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation," Ms May said.
And that means fixing up our dislocated housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-residents in the UK as it is for overseas-based companies to buy a home for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of home ownership has come a long way, and the anger of gold in awkward circumstances is extremely real.
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sanderland's boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott, a North-East club, is reviving the challenge of reviving, which is currently third in the League One, and which is three points away from the top.
He had gone to the Stadium of Light in the summer of this year after guiding St. Mary's for the Scottish premiere last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsund.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampshire with my father when I was a child, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in the management of the club.
As manager of Sanderland, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Goose Poot and Paulo de Canio.
Former Eloah Athletic Boss says he didn't feel any hesitation in following such established names in such a large club, which had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, the prediction of success for me can be made by the question of whether I can return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself succeeding here if I can get the club there."
As assistant boss of Dumbarton and after spending 15 months in Harts' coaching staff, Ross' management career has only lasted three years.
He then helped Eloah recover from the defeat of the third tier, and replaced St. Mirren with the winner of the championship title in the next session.
And Ross says they now feel more comfortable than the work they did during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academics.
In the case of taking charge of Aloe, he said, "It was probably a real cut."
"I really believed that management was more the right fit for me than playing.
It seems odd because I did a decent job, earned a fair amount of money, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is Saturday evening at 5.30 pm, found in the survey
The heat of the summer has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but the downturn in restaurants was down 4.8 per cent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the figures, said: "Keeping the Cowboys in July compared to the expected participation in the Cowboys Sun and England World Cup means that the Cowboys in July and the Cowboys in June followed the same pattern as the Cowboys in June.
The restaurant business fell by 1.8 per cent in June in July and worsened further.
The pubs and bars selling wines performed the strongest with more popularity than the restaurants.
Food-operated pubs also suffered damage in the sun, though not dramatically like restaurant operators do.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
For the month, sales of all pub and bar beverages rose by 6.6 per cent, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, vacation and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events is the biggest factor for sales in the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, though a year-on-year drop of 4.8 percent in sales, particularly due to ongoing cost pressure, would be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been the time and bad weather of the food-material operators and time will tell if the higher average temperature we have experienced in August will provide much needed relief.
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openers, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slower pace in the brand roll-out.
Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups that perform with a combined business of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and it is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey found that one in five children — some of whom are under the age of 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake insta" pages
The report raises concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "major" account to show to parents
One in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, "fake insta" accounts grew rapidly - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean "main" account to show to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that in it a teenager was urging others to "rape me."
A survey of independent schools conducted by Digital Awareness U.K. and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that of the 11 to 18-year-olds, two per cent had profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's very annoying that a lot of teenagers are lured to make an online place where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will have a "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed track and field athlete, and Chairman Ian Betty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have taken advantage of his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"In the minds of the elite, there is a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and World Athletics community and we are confident that bringing Athletics to the board in Scotland will bring a lot of benefits," Betty said.
"I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help in guiding the sport in Scotland," Doyle said.
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now who are regular BBC Pandits, became unable to walk after a momentary ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered an injury.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that the time will tell whether I will be well or not and to what extent I can be.
It was a terrible job, but to recover completely, to walk again and learn to practice chastity today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Comparison of breast pumps with cows of mothers by advertising has created differences in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company shared an online opinion through an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows' milk.
To mark the launch of a product called the “World’s First Silent Wearable Breast Pump”, consumer tech company Elvie has released a new funny music video-inspired advertisement, in which the new pump is free to express mothers.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a herd full of cows' grass that includes some of the following phrases: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't the tunes, these are my breasts."
"Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I AM Feeding Dam Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I AM Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from viewers, many said it presents the "terrorism" of the dairy industry in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
We need them to get pregnant and give birth to milk, just like we need them to give birth, except for the fact that their babies are stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother) Gets Consciously Fit Inside
Another comment: "Obviously sad for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?"
Someone else added: "What a irrelevant advertisement."
Other people defended the advertisement, one of whom said that they found the song of that advertisement "funny."
"I think that's a very good idea.
I would have had that too, if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel like I'm being a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the same way it is.
One wrote that it's a good product."
The second commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience "cow."
It is not advertising that promotes or decisively promotes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women said they were dancing carefully by pumping in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvish pump stays well hidden, has no wires or tubes and straightens out carefully into a nursing bra, allowing women to walk without pumping, grab their children and even go out.
Ana Ballerine, partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, worthy of a spectacular and brilliant launch.
By drawing parallels between the women and the cows of the dari, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, displaying a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvis has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Marta Jacoboskey, appeared to be catwalking for her.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The arrested migrant children were being spied on, even when there was no change relative to monthly border crossings, to some extent because the harsh curvature and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to appoint children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors had hired the migrants themselves without a document and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to live in the country by claiming any child further.
The threat rose even further in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other senior or senior members of the household would have to hand over their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, a senior officer in Matthew Elbens, Immigration and Customs Enforcement presented evidence before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record in the past.
"About 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and are the highest offenders among them.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Elbens said.
Demanding to prepare the children quickly, the officials introduced new rules, according to which children were required to be brought before the court within a month of being arrested instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the sheltered employees.
Many people appear through video conferencing calls instead of personally presenting their case to a non-immigrant judge for a legal status.
Those who are deemed ineligible for release are immediately expelled.
Children who remain imprisoned for long periods of time are just as likely to be left behind or saddened by them, which can be amplified in the violent impulse or escape efforts of protection workers and in recent months, according to the report of the system.
Lawyers or lawyers said that those cases are taken to a higher facility such as a tornillo, where the sign that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
He also said taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally prepared or without saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the trauma with which he is already struggling.
Syria has called on the occupying forces of the United States, Flanders and Turkey to return immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the war in the country was now eight years old.
Maulam, who also works as a Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces illegally reside on Syrian soil on the grounds of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly."
"They should go back from the war ground immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Maulam stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million people have been rooted out of their homes.
"Damascus will continue to fight this unnatural war until we clear all the Syrian areas of both the terrorist groups and the 'presence of a foreigner,'" he said.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Khurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Maulam said the conditions were right for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading the fear of despair, which prompted the refugees to stay away.
"""We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,"" he said."
"They were politicizing a completely humane case."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any assistance for reconstruction unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. politicians say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at Idlib's last major rebel stronghold creates an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
The Russo-Turkish deal or agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people lived.
However, Maulam said the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked fighters from the Nusra Front, who "will be targeted."
U.S. Representative Stepan Di Mistra hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with the government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the path to elections soon.
Maulam placed certain conditions on the committee for the Syrian government's participation, stating that the work of the panel to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference should be banned.
Why Trump will win in the second term
From that point of view, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, as long as many liberals or elites are not expecting any accusations and scams to end their term ahead of time.
"This will certainly be the most dramatic end to the national post to date!"

In the race of the Election House, an influx of external money flooded into the strong middle ground
It was no surprise that Pennsylvania had flooded with money or cash in the 17th, which was credited to the rebuilding of the Congressional body, resulting in two officials appearing for the race of the same seat.
Which recently opened the front for the Democratic Rape Conner Lamb in suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
The lamps were also included in a run for a second post, Republican Kathleen Rothfeus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
After this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional forgery in favour of the Republicans by the old districts, the maps or maps were reconstituted.
The empty-handed battle between the major financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race had touched the campaign economy.
The name Lamb became widespread in Pennsylvania after a massive victory widely seen in the March 18th Congressional District Special Elections in Pennsylvania.
For this reason, the Republicans had held that seat for almost a decade and President Donald Trump had won that district by 20 points.
The political pandits provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. to punish al-Salvador to support China, then back down
The diplomats mentioned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of Washington's resistance.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization's management team expelled the partners.
In a statement earlier this month, Department spokesman Hyder Norte said that on the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" the government department officials had issued a statement from Al Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.

But only Al Salvador was fined, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalty, which included deductions and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference on the sidelines of the United Nations, focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow the same amalgamation or population as last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they want the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any penalties or penalties for al-Salvador.
The politicians said that Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which has now been scheduled in mid-October, in a sign of importing the administrative places at the conference.
And the three U.S. returned to the Republic of Al Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the debate or discussion details described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss the internal considerations at the deliberation on the condition of not clarifying the name.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who are close to the administration and also speak on the condition of not clarifying the name.
The history of study
The next case could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible resistance to Mr Trump's justice, of which there is now sufficient evidence in the public record.
At the same time, according to the Mr Mueller report, the direction of his investigation is changed if Mr Trump's campaign ties with Russia in order to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself held accountable in that body, when he prepares himself again to go before the voters and perhaps before a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot if or if and I do not mean to indicate or suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to go on a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to prevent the massacre of so many years.
The functioning of the historical centre points around such separation points and the imminent march of democracy are accelerated or delayed therein.
Americans now have to face many of these points of separation.
What would we do if Mr. Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentin, the person who controls the final result of Mr. Mueller's investigation, was fired from the job?
Rosentin has been in this confusion since this paper reported it last year, suggesting secretly keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosentin said that the Times' account is not accurate.
"If Brett Kawangoh's recently requested F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he remains steadfast in the Supreme Court despite the evidentiary allegations of sexual exploitation and false testimony, how will we react?"
And on top of that, will we vote in the medium term for Congress, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail those investigations, democracy will remain for a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the lessons I have learned in the past.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had also previously occupied my ambassador’s house.
She lived and settled in the United States and after 60 years, she sent me to burn Sabeth candles on a table that became affordable.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?"

Graham Doran's Rangers are optimistic even after the intense Viana encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the Austrians won them a strong position in the European League group ji to qualify for a strong draw.
The knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Turn from appearing for the first time in a 2-2-equal session with the villain, but he believes rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good thing for us because the villains were good,” the 31-year-old said.
"We moved forward in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and come to a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we were even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with the crowd or crowd behind us in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and can get positive results.
Whatever happened with my injuries and with the changes made to the club itself was certainly difficult last year but now this place has a good experience.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they’ve got good training.
I hope that now we can move forward and succeed by leaving behind our previous session.
Women are losing their sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the people across the country said they were talking to their partner about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to interact," said Holi Cynder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare to take care of your family if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counselor and your family about where and how to get care, as they can be important factors in determining the cost of options.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest ways for you to pay for those expenses.
A traditional long-term care insurance policy to help pay for these expenses or insure your own health in your long-term care options for long-term care. A hybrid cash-value life insurance policy is one that you can have.
Submit your legal documents: Make your legal battles easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you can hire a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professional will follow your wishes.
Also, consider the attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapable.
Don’t forget the little info: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and they are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions about their medications and allergies?
Tell that information in a written plan, so that you are ready.

Officials describe the BST shooting as an "accidental incident" at around 02:30 p.m.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His wounds were not so deep so the police called him to become a witness.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami killed at least 384 people in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further, officials said.
When the communication was shut down, the rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Residency, the northern region of Palu which is near the 7.5 magnitude earthquake supercentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shores of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a resort on the beach in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, which has spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The estimated population of 299 in the region below the administrative province was 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining in the province is also very important, but it is centered in morovali on the opposite shores of maximum salvage.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami in Palu and Dongala has hit several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died due to the tsunami in Dongala and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, a tsunami hit western Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and regularly suffers earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake hit 14 countries on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in North Sumatra on December 26, killing 226,000 people on the coastline of the Indian Ocean, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in early March and April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias on the Sumatra coast.
2006: Activating a tsunami on Indonesia's most populous island, Java, a 6.8-sized tsunami hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang affected the area which is the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the area on the island of Mantawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be devastated and nearly 300 people killed in the I tsunami in an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A tsunami hit the Pidi Jaya region in AK, causing destruction and devastation as it caused people to remember the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed due to the collapse of buildings or buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes wreak havoc on Indonesia's tourist island of Lobok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north direction of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.

Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.

Federal prosecutors are demanding rare death penalty for suspects in NYC attack
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutor Saifulo Sipov is seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack on the city of New York that killed eight people -- a virulent sentence handed down in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Sapporo, 30, used a home depot rental truck to allegedly invade by bike along the way of the western direction highway in Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the information of the intention to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov has "consciously" killed eight victims and "consciously" physically assaulted them.
These two countries potentially impose the death penalty as per the court document.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Cypov with a knife for 22 charges, including eight murder charges for aiding in racketeering, which are committed specifically by co-defendants in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "sufficient planning and prior deliberations" to be held, explaining the manner in which Cypov carried it out in a "disgusting, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Safulo Habibulavic Sipov in Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves Enrique Dekat, Derren Drake, Eriel Allerge, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Fer<0xC3><0xBA>ki, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Aloj<0xC3><0xA1>nda."
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The death penalty case in New York's South District has been pending for more than a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Bran was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, for the last time in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Commonwealth during the Cold War two years ago was sentenced to death.
Jon Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Sipov did not have any grievances or regrets for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said that he told the investigators that he liked everything he did.
Cypov told officials that he was prompted to attack after seeing ISIS videos of the crime on his phone.
Police said that he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not to be convicted of the offence of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, says he is "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental injury of this event to include everyone," Patton said.
The Cypov defence team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori MP says Nijel Faraj should be made in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to "gather an army of the people" during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Ukip leader urged politicians to 'understand the environment' from Euroskeptics - as one of Theresa May's own MP suggested that they should interact with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told reporters in Birmingham in March that if Mr Faraj had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have been 'outsided' by now.
But the challenges faced by Smt. May in resolving her highly divided rank have been underlined by Pro-Remen Tory to add a different opposition to Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his checker's compromise plan on track during the attacks on Brexiters, Remeners and the European Union.
The allies urged him to try to make a deal with Brussels instead of Backlash - and force Euroskeptics and workers to choose between their package and animosity.
Mr. Bone said quitting means quitting the rally at Solihal, in which he wants to 'throw the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be made a partner and he should be given the responsibility of interacting with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gone out by now," he said.
"""I will stand for Brexit, but we need to get the checkers out,"" Wellingtonboro's MP or MP said."
Setting up its opposition in the European Union, he said: "We don't have to be subject to anyone to fight a world war."
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bon rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 election: "It's a complete lie that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkin also said in March: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checker is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our workers who actually encircle the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Smt., he said: The Prime Minister maintains his jobs when he does not break his promise.
Mr. Faraj said that the leaders of the rally should be made 'feeling the environment' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes,"" he said."
"They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we have come here to tell them that 'We will not let you run away by doing that.'"
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of deceiving Brexit by understanding the environment.
"We are organizing the army of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remeners march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally takes place in the middle of the city.
A group of activists hinted at Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Pier Lord Adonis appears to be talking to the party about security issues that are happening with the app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they may have the right IT system for Canada, the irresistible border and the borderless free trade in Ireland and all the technology.
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Waran plans to adopt a 'sharp view' on President's operation
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the President's operation" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during a town hall in western Massachusetts, Massachusetts Republicans or Democrats spoke about their futures.
President Donald Trump's regular critic, Warren GOP, is in the race for re-election in the state's prestigious Joof Dehel November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were being accused of taking Trump's place in 2020.
It was his 36th meeting with voters using the format of the town hall since Trump took office on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood, according to the Times.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the race of the president.
Warren replied that now is the time to "go and fix our broken-foot government and in which women should be included first."
LSU Sim's death has been reported as a misdemeanor
In Batton Disease, LA, police announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim was arrested on Friday.
The Batton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Datton Simpson at 11 a.m. at ET News Conference or Conference.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton knocked out the world title after the team's victory over the Sebestian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas deserved to play a major role in the Lewis Hamilton Mercedes" team order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and kicked Hamilton out as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vétel to create a hurdle in his team's drivers.
Vettel first went to the pits and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes was behind a lap and came out from behind the Vettel but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the driver of the Ferrari reluctantly leave the third corner defending without a double-move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in fifth place on reaching the end of the first lap until his 21st birthday.
Then he moved on to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tires and moved ahead of Raccoonen in fourth place.
He eventually came to the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight lap when Reconene took fourth place.
It was a difficult day when Valerie did a great job all weekend and is a really good decent person.
The team did a great job by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad feeling.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Finestein at his request, not leaking a letter from Kristin Blasy Ford in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual exploitation.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the statement given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented on the current situation of the Senate, saying the people are "meaningful and bad and dishonest."
"There's a very good thing or thing that could happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, meaningful and bad and disloyal people," he said.
"When you look at the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didnt do that.
Do you remember?
"Den Fennstein, did you leak it?"
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I did not leak.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he said, pointing to the senator.
Fenstein was sent a letter of explanation of allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked in early September - but Fenstein denied it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he said."""
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "I can tell you that it was really a very bad feeling.
Maybe he didn't, but I've hardly ever seen such a bad mood before.
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, by whom three women have been accused of sexual misconduct, the President said that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power by any necessary means.
You see their meaning, their shit, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the arbitrator reported in the President's words.

The air traffic controller was hit to ensure that hundreds of people could escape from the quake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could be landed safely on the ground.
Activating the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, more than 800 people have been killed and many more missing.
Subsequent injuries in the area continued to devastate and many people were trapped under the debris in the town of Palu.
But when his associates were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gwan Agung refused to leave his busyly controlled post at Mutiara Sis al Jufari Airport, Palu.
He was stalling there to ensure that the Beetic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died at the hospital.
This decision could have saved the lives of hundreds of people, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikappan to take him to a larger hospital from another city in Kalimantan.
"Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter arrived.
"Our hearts were broken when they left," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll with the destruction of the country could reach thousands, the mitigation agency says access to Dongala, Sighi and Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate may still rise as many bodies may still be crushed in remains or debris, or in many places where it cannot be reached," said Sutopo Nughroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre-high waves devastated Palu, culminating in a mass burial on Sunday.
The army and commercial aircraft are bringing in assistance and supplies.
Resa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance came with the bodies.
It is rare to find clean water.
Everywhere, small markets were robbed. "
The head of the International Red Cross, Jain Gallfand, told CNN: "Indonesia is running a race to help the Red Cross survivors, but we don't know what they'll get there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or vacation from all of you.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, a quake erupted in Lobok in Indonesia, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nyugini now tells that a man has been missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macron, now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were rescued from the plane by drowning.
Air Niyugini said in a release on Saturday that he did not find a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local officials, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to a request for overriding information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
While attempting to land at the failed island airport when the plane went into the water, local boats helped save the other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and how it happened is unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not even land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come very low.
Jane said, "It's a very good thing."
Jane said that she and others drowned in the plane and were pulled out of the deep water by the emergency exit.
He said the plane's employees were frightened and screaming and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working around to improve the gorge also helped to save people by using an airborne boat to bring people ashore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
The data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of a PNG-registered airline in the last two decades but none were involved in the air crash.
The analyst said the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution reopened its case on Saturday for retrial of a man on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used the cellphone record to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Roulette said it obtained location data from several cell phones, which shows that the deceased was with the talisman chambers on the evening of her previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Missile Sanford, at the time his cell phone was near the chambers, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented his speech and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by prosecutors if Tallis is telling the truth, when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "speaking a lie because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tallis said he already knew the chambers about two weeks before his death.
The cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Roulette said that some time after the Chamber's death, Tillies has removed all of the Chamber's text or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hal said.
The defence parties are ready to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to go to the jury for the hearing of the case on that day.

The other black man?
NY Naini sues the couple after firing after the "anti-fascist" text
When a New York nanny complains by a mother that she is "the other black person," the deceptive text follows a biased lawsuit against a couple for firing.
Couples deny that they are resisting, prosecuting for "attraction."
Lincey Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, finds out that Gisselle Morris, who takes care of the new children, expresses her badge, which was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York post, after realizing her mistake, an "unreasonable" Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing nanny who was African-American had done a bad job and that she had done one instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Ubar by paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris seeks compensation of $350 per day on the job on the couple and for six months, though in live-in gigs he was hired to start work without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do such a thing," he said in a post on Friday, saying, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple said on the claims that they are casteists, stating that after insulting him they could not rely on him, it was appropriate to end Maurice's employment.
"My wife sent me something that didn't mean it.
He is not a casteist.
We are not casteist people," the husband who told Plasco the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
What's your new baby?
Let it go."
Similar to the "attraction" trial, Plasco said his wife had only been having a baby for two months and she was in "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going after someone like that?"
It's not right to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal process is still ongoing, he has given a quick response to the couple's accusations on social media, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Padiston publishers fear that the reader will not associate it with their own ideas and opinions, the new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone's own place on reading it for the first time before it's published.
It is amazing to know about the success of Pennington.
Talking about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by the toy of a small bear, he was optimistic about his work being rejected, he said that both Gauchi and the 60th anniversary of his book's publication were on the eve of his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family," she says her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a cool guy and he wasn't proud at all," she said.
"But because Pendington was very real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it."
I think they've seen Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his imagination and composition, he always credited Paddington for it.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where work done by doctors was in vain.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, there was no such expectation from him," Ms. Aden-Lappus said.
"Then Nade called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son."
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine given by the doctors to beat his heart was slowly ending up leaving his system.
He had died a while ago and it was all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, even knowing that it's all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything screaming, screaming or crying, because I was surrounded by my family’s people.
I had to take care of everyone.
Finally, Mrs. Aden-Laparus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of what situation they were going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I put my head down and cried all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see a sense of extreme sympathy for Nade on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Women's postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide, they want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the bridge of Wales with inspiring messages, on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis’ son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like the parent I feel every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in London, said his son was a hon. chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could light up everywhere.
Although he had quit work before he died and he was living in a "very dark room."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother who was searching for his lost brother or sister at the age of 11, then committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly concerned that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms. Davis created the card, "To tell people that there are people out there who you can talk to by going, even if he's not a friend."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he couldn't find an eye for them.
He said his death was a big pity for him, but he had to get out of it: "It ripped the family apart from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to move forward.

When the FBI investigation began, Kavanaugh's future was in jeopardy.
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for - a limited time and limited scope of investigation - maybe we'll find a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and also that he feared that the alleged biased gridlock was "between the committee."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of their unwillingness.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 – as the Republicans are expected to perform very poorly, they would be severely weakened in the efforts they wanted to win in the High Court on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and meets his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sitting.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuwangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which was to be confirmed by Mike Pence, the Vice President, by winding it up and the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Kim "died" by fugitives
North Korea's number of fugitives to South Korea declined when John-on came to power seven years ago, a South Korean manager said.
Citing the Ministry of Southern Integration, Park Beyong-siyog said that 1,127 people have fled their duties in 2011 compared to 2,706 last year.
Mr. Park said that the strong borders between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and extortionists were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of fugitives from the north are eventually proposed to become citizens of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum China has fled, which is the longest border with North Korea and is easy to cross the heavily protected uncivilized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly sends them back to their country.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocked nuclear talks.
It was activated in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to terms of working towards the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yang-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in the United States, our national security will be unreliable and in such circumstances, we will have no way but to inflict unilateral harm on ourselves first," Mr. Roy said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelori called Brett Kavanaugh "funny" and said he was not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brat Kavangua "fun" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think a month can do such a show, they call it 'funny'," Pelosi said Thursday, reacting to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kawangua emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly penalized the Democrats on the committee by proving them to be falsely accused of "controversial and coordinated character guppying" by liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he feels that Kavanaugh's witnesses have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as this shows that he is acting against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he went to Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt that even if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, would he blame Kavanaugh?
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kawangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential rules of Kavanaugh against the lucrative care of the Act or Ro V. Wed, as they are known to do conservative justice.
In the course of his acknowledgment, Kavanaughua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaughua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious objection, the anger of months and years comes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamin told me 45 years later that "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She was saying, "A woman who helped me a lot when she worked for an officer somewhere, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, I can tell you that she cries because the person I was talking to is crying," she said.
I'm angry.'
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was very good.
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An initial job, one of my sharpest memories of a man's head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, I found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from behind - a sharp manager I had always been a little afraid of in the neck.
"Don't cry in front of anyone,"" he said."
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them.
A woman president of the Democratic Congress from Patricia Shroder, Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught making a connection to any party other than a boat or a name in a boat called Monkey Business and his name was taken back from the race, Mrs. Shroder, who was extremely disappointed, she herself did not want to take part in the race of the President.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” he said laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Consumables."
Since the campaign had been delayed, she did not have time to raise money and so she swore that until she raised $2 million, she would not participate in the race.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give him $250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" she wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was unable to control the emotions - thanks to those who gave him support, disappointment from the system which made it difficult for him to mobilize money and defraud him on bail - and aimed at deputies
"You would have thought I would have a nervous breakdown," Ms. Shroder recalled how the press would have reacted about them.
"You would have thought that Clanex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samurai.
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade could be good for Beijing's war
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was slowing down and while the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With the new tariffs hitting items of up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), the most significant increase this week is effectively taxed on all the more than half of the goods that came to the United States from China.
Beijing has resisted in its own way every time, most recently a five to 10 percent slapping tariff on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to thaw soon.
Getting Washington back means opening up the demands, but publicly beating the head in front of the US would be very embarrassing for the Chinese president, Zee Jingping.
Still, experts say Beijing can go its own way, the U.S. trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"It's the fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either start economic turmoil in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than the spectators have ever seen before," said a researcher at the Center for the Study of Economic and Social Sciences, Abigail Grace.
"We are ready to return the Syrian refugees," the foreign minister said.
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulam said the situation in the country was improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and safe due to the progress made today against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to resettle in areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore the normal situation.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the uprising.
The rider wins the European Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup against the USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The US has now faced defeat on European soil six times in a row and has not won the Rider's Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Denmark's captain Thomas Jorn reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water on the 16th hole, accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 so far since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Speed was beaten by Denmark's Thorbjohn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player on the European team, by 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Dunson, lost 2 and 1 to Lane Polter of England, who had probably played his last rider's cup.
An experienced eight-rider cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European winner every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It has been a difficult year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I was able to help," Greece said emotionally after Europe's victory.
She beat fellow golfer John Ram, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of defeating Tiger Wood, I've grown up seeing them,"" said 23-year-old Raham."
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now he has 13-21-3 career rider cup records.
One of the greatest players to date has won 14 major titles in second place only after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finney, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
After his squad's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furk said, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe.
We have defeated them.
Congratulations to thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and the Rider Cup Committee of America and move forward with Thosm.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to greet them.
We played better.
