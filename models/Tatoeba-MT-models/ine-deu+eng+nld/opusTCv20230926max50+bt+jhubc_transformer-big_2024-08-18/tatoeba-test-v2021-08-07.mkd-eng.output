Fortunately, I hit him.
I made a phone call.
I've made up my mind.

I've really pissed Tom off.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I don’t have enough money at the moment.
I'm sorry, but I poured coffee on the flies.
I have a cat swim.
It violates all the rules.
Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate formulation of the question.

I'm dying of thirst.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
That's what I mean.
I thought I'd tell you.
Applauded.
We met around noon.

I met your girlfriend.
I expect a call from them.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
I'm fat.
I'm feeling better.
I'm feeling great.

I'll see you later.
I'll take Tom's place.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
I'll make sure I get there on time.
I'll wait here for you.
I'll go with Tom.
I'm so grateful for you.
It's my fault.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I'm happy these days.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
I'd be happy to help.

I'm shot!
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
I'm fascinated by your design.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
I'm stunned, Tom.
I'll be in Boston all week.
I'm in charge of the propaganda.
I'm inclined to trust you.
I'm in love and confused.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
I'm in.
I am irreplaceable.
I miss Boston.
I've missed the game.
I'm jealous of Tom.
I'm just a farmer.
I'm only calling you as long as I can hear you.
I'm a little sick.
I'm just finalizing the report.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
I'm just glad I can help.
I'm just having a little fun.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm just so proud of you.
I'm just starving.
I'm just surprised.
I'm just thinking out loud.
Just try to find him.
I'm just watching TV.
I'm keeping an account.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I'm lazy.
I'm learning the piano.
I'm looking for them now.
I'm looking for you.
My hair's falling out.
I'm blaming myself.
I'm making a movie.
I'm making a snowman.
I'm making a jackass.
I'm married to Laurie.
I'm married to Laurie.
I'm naked.
I'm not good enough for you.
I'm not your equal.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
I'm not a monster.
I'm not an expert.
I'm not a patient.
I'm not as fast as you are.
I'm not a student.
I'm not a truck driver.
I'm not a whore.
I'm not calling them.
I don't curse their children.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
I'm not sure.
I don't like this.
I'm not digging your wells.
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
I'm not even tired.
I'm not that hot either.
I can't find the equation.
I'm not a local.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going, so let it be what it wants.
I'm not leaving.
I'm not coming back.

I'm not taking that chance.
I won't wait for them.

You're not gonna command me, man.
I'm not here to hurt people.
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm not incapacitated.
I am not misunderstood,
I'm not judging you.
I'm not going with Tom.
I'm not like you!

I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
I'm not sure where to put this.
I'm not talking about him.
I didn't hurt Tom.
I'm not smart.
I'm not unemployed.
I'm not a scientist at that.
I'm usually not at work on Mondays.
I won't wait to find out.
I'm not your runner.
I'm fat.
I'm going to help my friends.
I'm no use to you here.
I'm one of your students.
I'm only 18 years old.
I'm just here to help him.
I'm on my way right now.
I'm open to everything.
I've motivated you.
I was out of breath.
I won't be in town next week.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I overcame the shock.
I don't mind waiting here.
I'm thirsty for him.
I'm kicking him.
I'm pretty hungry!
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm pretty bloated.
I'm insisting.
I'm quiet.
I'm pretty proud of that.
I'm reading it now.
I'm ready for him now.
I was ready for war.
I'm ready to do that.
I'm ready to make up for it.
I'm very confused.
I'm very good with animals.
I'm relaxed.
I'm late for school.
I'm sad.
I'm safe.
I'm keeping him seated.
I'm looking for food.
I see ghosts.
I'll send Tom home.
I'm shocked.
I'm lower than you.
I'm sick of being called a liar.
It's in my head from the French language.
I'm getting out of the war.
I'm sleepy.
I'm so scared.
I'm so glad I'm home.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm sorry, but I'm not up to it now.
I'm sorry, but my answer was denied.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm sorry to fall like this.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'm starving.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm still at work.
I'm still thinking about her.
I'm still thinking about him.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm stronger than you.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
I'm learning French.
I'm studying music.
I'm such a coward.
I'm so retarded!
I need to help them.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming up.
I'm sure I can find him.
I'm sure I can find them.
I'm sure I'm right.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
I'm sure Tom was never in Boston.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do his best.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it this way.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
I'm sure you've seen everything.
I'm sure.
I was surprised that it was so easy.
I'm surprised myself.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm gonna take a break for lunch.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I'm taking you to school.
I'm talking about him.
I'm wearing a haircut.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm the crazy one.
That's who I wanted to meet, Tom.
I got kicked out.
I'm the one you love.
I'm the only one here who knows where you've hidden Tom's jewels.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
I'm weak.
I'm 30 years old.
I'm 30 years old.
I'm three hours away.
It's over between me and Tom.
I'm all right.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
I'm tired of your constant grievances.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
I'm too low.
I'm too young to die.
I'm dead serious.
I'm hardened.
I'm doing my best.
I'm trying to avoid them.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way you'll understand.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I'm trying to help Tom.
I'm trying to work.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm not armed.
I feel like it's raining all day.
I'm worried.
I need to put water in the radiator.
I must be losing my hearing.
I have to go home.
I need to find a way to help them.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
I need to rest.
I have to go.
I need to talk to you.
I must have forgotten.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
I'm very busy here.
I'm very confused.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I look forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunglasses.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
I'm waiting for it to turn green.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
I'm walking with her.
It's warm.
I'm a tree.
I'm wet.
I'm willing to help.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
I’m with the person I want to be with.
I work in Boston now.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get lost.
I'm writing my will.
I'm your new partner.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
I did it.
They probably won’t pay the money.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I almost had a heart attack.
I need a box of kids.
I need a clean shirt.
I need a musical instrument.
I need an ashtray.
I need an envelope.
I need a secretary.
I need dinner.
I need permission.
I needed the money.
I need food.
I need to be proud to transfer them.
I need the internet.
I need new speakers for the computer.
I need peace and quiet after a hard day at work.
I need a walnut.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I need sunscreen.
I need three markers.
I need to be alone.
I need to call him.
I have to admit something.
I need to feed them.
I need to paint my house.

I need Tom.
I need to spend more time at work.
I need to figure it out.
I need some.
I need a second.
I need you more than you can imagine.
I need you to find them.
I need you to open my door.
I’ve never changed my sleep schedule.
I didn't even doubt it.
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
I didn't get an answer from her.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I've never been caught.
I didn't hurt them at all.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
I have not learned to write.
I never lied to you.
I never ask for handcuffs.
I didn't say I trusted him.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
I didn't touch him.
I didn't want that at all.
I never meant to cheat on you.
I never wear a suit.
I never win.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.

How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is it all there?
He's breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I nodded my head.
Definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I have to pack.
I have to go change my clothes.

I should sue him.
I should take a look.

Is it far from here?

I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a slayer.
I was sleeping in the slumber.
I slept on the bus.
Nakoso cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? - No.

Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't that great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've lost something strange.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there a word at all?
Is it Necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that enough?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that's what happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?

Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?

Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it yours on the radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is there a free place?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do it.
I still don't understand women.
I still have a lot of respect for Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.

Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Are you interested, Tom?
Are you looking for Tom?
Is Tom harassing you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I've stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dungeon.
I'm studying art history.
All of a sudden I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand for exiting the caverns.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to lie down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't have caught you even if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
All of this makes sense.
Seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
That's you for now.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, could it have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's disappointing.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter if you don’t want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Looks like it's not helping.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm teaching Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm fine.
That gave me an idea.
I've got a lot to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too quickly.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cool.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I think about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I might get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm going out to eat.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good point.

I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel is going to be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's insane.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's conservative.

I think Tom's hardened.
I think Tom's futile.
I think Tom is contemplative.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was bluffing.
I don't think Tom will go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're freaking out.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should end this by yourself.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I seem to have made a mistake.
I thought I'd never find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought I was being blamed.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retiring.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a hard time.
Didn't you love the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
You don't hate him, do you?
I thought he was tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you knew how to swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better at chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
It is a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no way I'll get the job done in a day.
Today it is less humid than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Do you mind if I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come to mind.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It’s starting to come into our minds that we can’t ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's going to be Christmas soon.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna hurt.
It looked awful.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
Seems familiar to me.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday, my head's spinning, I'm a great chump.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
Looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He cut me off.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's already too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll turn out tonight.
Maybe it looks weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have been surprised.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he's not welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna be awkward.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I got up.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
I took off my pants.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth the wait.
He came back two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
They're about to roll.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is advisable to check if there can be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the drug that was prescribed to you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything is in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be a little while before it's done.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go a little bit longer.
It's great fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's 11:00 already.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast on foot.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's going to take a lot of work.
They've broken it up.
It's just a pain in the ass.
He's been coming back for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
You'd better not talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It’s better to be optimistic and cheat than to be pessimistic and right.
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees, then why are you still alive?”
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's common knowledge that you don't have a dear Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
Definitely they are.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It’s easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged it.
Looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to be pissed.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That’s what happened and preceded it.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is a lot of fun.
She's getting dressed.
It's darkening.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be monstrous.
It's gonna get colder.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's a good training.
It's good.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
What matters to me is what you think about Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It is impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is where.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's up to me, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It’s nice to have such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just a guess.
It's not an ordinary pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not that we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn’t happen very often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really loud.
Sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's fucked up.
Actually, it's very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complex.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
There's still a prison outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It’s strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's great. It's great.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
Can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It relaxes a lot.
It's too easy to understand.
It's warm in here.
I don't think so.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's up to you to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
It was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a mess I spent the evening with a smart, witty, pretty girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It's been a wonderful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful night.
It was a childlike behavior on his part.
It was filthy.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was nighttime.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn’t easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was very majestic.
That was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He blew a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was nasty.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the jaw.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was a pity.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incomprehensible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a try.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
It's not gonna help you.
It's working well.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I get to explain everything to you.
I need you urgently.
