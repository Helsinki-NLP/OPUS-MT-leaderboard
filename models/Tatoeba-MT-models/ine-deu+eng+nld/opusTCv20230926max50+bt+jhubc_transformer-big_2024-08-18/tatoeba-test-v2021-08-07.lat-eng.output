If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
Thou hast made my heart faint with one of thine eyes, and with one of the hairs of thy neck.
And thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in the strong place of thy habitation, which thou hast made, O LORD, a sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.
And you shall keep this law for yourself and for your children forever.
Thou shalt live by thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake and loose his yoke from off thy neck.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I am the LORD thy God, the jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and doing kindness unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not speak false witness against thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet his wife, nor his bondwoman, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor all that he has.
Thou shalt not go up by steps to my altar, lest thy shame be revealed.
Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.
Do not steal.
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for he that taketh the name of the LORD his God in vain shall not sin against the LORD.
