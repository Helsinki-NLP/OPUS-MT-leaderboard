Welsh MPs worry they will "look like Muppet"
Some Assembly Members (AMs) have been appalled by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentarians from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the subject of a message.
A Labour MP said that his group was concerned that the name was "rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp govance.
The parliamentary representative from the Wales Party (Plaid Cymru) said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to a name change, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh word "w" is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing the law to introduce the change, announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentarians will be titled will be on their own."
The Welsh Government's 2017 law gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that found broad support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to how members of the Assembly will be called, the Committee was inclined to be called "Welsh Parliament Members" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Parliamentarians are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to the Speaker of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assemblies work, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentarians will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its own demise of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its EU and NATO accession process.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zorana Zaev, say the change is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are ringing as churches in Harlem struggle for survival.
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past, there could be at least one church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no one else today.”
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
“People are meeting in a different way today,” he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly stay."
When it comes to churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and “sooner or later it will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so the day will come sooner when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation, which held worship services nearby, took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson had planned its reconstruction, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has taken place in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of whom were brought by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
Sacristy, the leading body of the parish made up of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July over concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injured 13-Year-Old During Scuba Diving for Hummingbirds in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was chasing a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened sometime before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with his friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then drove the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was excitement about the lobster being caught, but then he realized he was shouting “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire keybone was torn.
“I hoped everyone would come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigations and bathers' safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition with chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic countertops in the style of department stores and by engaging specialized retailers.
As part of a large entry into the UK beauty market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn, which continues to grow alongside a decline in sales in the clothing and home appliances market, larger cosmetic countertops will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year.
Investing in cosmetics is one of the ways that supermarkets seek to make use of the shelf space that was once intended for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique range of decorative cosmetics, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
Fragrance Shop will also use concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first to open last week in Croydon, South London, and the second to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Network shopping and returning to daily shopping of small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles to resist favorable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, because two years ago it bought both chains, which it claimed spurred the sale of groceries and made those acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to refresh their departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals was not successful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmacies in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Celesia, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skin care products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the special training of colleagues who will be at the customer's side and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in the old buying habits."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon's Day star Peter Jones left to "cook out of anger" after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks & Spencer and ITV chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and Truly fashion accessories.
Their brand is compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning (37), announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Day star Peter Jones to cook with rage by stepping out of her lucrative joint business at the last minute to focus on her own brilliant new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to dedicate herself to their brand home.
This work was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have secured it for the next few decades.
Her decision to resign has stunned everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the show's host, This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home apparel.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones joined them as chairman of the board in March.
Couples spend vacations together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Difficult conversations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get in the newspapers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
Trump said, mimicking the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have been stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not notice the "appropriate reaction" of the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. has still not lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results — interrupting missile test launches, aiding in the release of hostages and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena for entry, we would have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for using international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it’s all a bit problematic,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Given the constant shaking of the ground in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the anger of nature.
Although shelters in the event of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a siren for tsunami warnings in Palu, although the warning was in force, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time traveling between the numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s decayed structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Jokoa is struggling with a lack of financial resources, and new elections are being held next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal for a draw against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal in a 1:0 score for Chelsea.
He shifted the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite rack.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped from Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped towards it and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half time with 1-0 after scoring Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blues forward forwarded the ball back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that game before turning somewhere on the half of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he pointed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and left footed the ball into the net on the opposite stand next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster office said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference that a large number of people were reported to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 quake that was felt on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters in height.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after his wife was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stabbing wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like to hear from everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived on stage who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway, and police said the process of informing the victim's closest relative was underway.
The taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take a few hours before they can return to their apartments.
The police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He kept saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed in the fenced area, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of policemen stood inside the fenced area and supervised the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, citing Minutes 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of a debate on the "transformation of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society called Mr. Crick's attempt "foolishness" and "an attempt to cross history."
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently underway regarding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Westminster Palace would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the historiography of a person that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament from outside pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this opinion is completely credible is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honor and recognition."
Swine Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead from a cut artery and covered in blood near a stop at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning News reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead, and the neighboring pig's door was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stall with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig bit the breeder to death.
Evening news of Guiyang says that a cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
A security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, swine attacks on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had snatched a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains over the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 am, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is being created above the Pacific and is moving towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northwards toward the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the formation of strong precipitation in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential flooding, mudslides and possible desert landslides.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation to occur at about 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above much of Arizona.
Turbulent floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go on foot in the desert because of the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust storms.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains on parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation in quantities greater than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less muddy bushes and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical rainforests will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday late in the evening and on Monday early in the morning before reaching the end of the day on Monday and covering the wider area on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread into the area on Tuesday, touching the borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, and last for the entire day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the retarded summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm from 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political reckoning continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to announce a turnaround at the last minute that Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, that the FBI would conduct a week-long indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a heartfelt testimony that he was absolutely sure it didn’t happen.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to a Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better idea, this is an audience that is similar in number to the one watching American football play or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained great even after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded him being yelled at by demonstrators as he was trying to take a lift to go to the Justice Committee's hearing.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes peeled off while the demonstrators exposed him live in front of CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to this country?”
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement even before the elevator doors closed that he would say more at a committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on sending Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigates charges against candidates over the next week, which were demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After conversations with Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview in the same issue with her on the headlines, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties was "complete nonsense".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on charges of absconding murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Waydeo and killing him.
A security deposit of $350,000 was requested.
The office of the coroner of the Eastern Baton Rouge municipality on Friday published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratories, Southern University Police, and citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for enforcing the law on "persistence and the search for truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 183-cm-tall wing player grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash at Mexico City
The ash that ejects the volcano Popocatapetl has reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists note the increased activity of a volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 quake in 2017 rocked central Mexico.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The clash between the Catalan separatists and the police coincided with the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators clashed with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined protests to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began shooting police officers with eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting broke out later in the day when police used the sticks to calm the fighting.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiveness” and Unionists shouted “Long Live Spain” against them.
Fourteen people were admitted to hospital due to minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.
Tensions in a region striving for independence have not subsided even a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal, and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the exit was small because those who opposed the split mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Groups advocating for independence spent the night on the streets on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a key, albeit close victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties are struggling to keep pace this year as their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention where they are not awaiting trial for their role.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was sparked by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has announced to the investigative prison since the end of last year that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidates for the European elections are the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being stabbed in the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving into a Londonderry home several times.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the courtyard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point an arrow was fired from a sniper rifle on the car.
Lots brought Livingston victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought victory
The new club of the Scottish Premiership league Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat of eighteen games at the head of the club from the Ibrox stadium.
Dolly Menge's success proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberians in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a Premiership guest win this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league behind whom they are eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Missed Opportunities Against Dead Guests
Holt's team had to lead even before they hit that shot, given that their directness in attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but it was too late on his way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only broadly point the ball after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's headshot to the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the guests
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi who hit in the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs thwarted Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent a wide shot from another organised attack by Livingston.
Long additions failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two elevens were not convicted - following Halkett's clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
"Glorious" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent game and the result of Livingston.
All to one were excellent, so they continued to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return among the big clubs, but a big credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading a well-organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to take a breather throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards they set for a good game under Gerrard.
They failed to reach the ball to the end. They only opened a hole in the home team once and it's a kind of call to race for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomes mixed feelings in Cologne <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was full of smiles under the bright sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They differed in their views on issues involving human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a mass gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of the president's supporters appeared nearby who came to see him.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – including a large number of Kurds – raised their voices condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor who is celebrated as a hero by some German Turks, while others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist fatally injured in car crash
The cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist was killed after a crash and a driver fled from the crash site on Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
The city police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Roads have been closed due to the accident and bus traffic has been diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in unrest in a male prison of a closed type.
The riots erupted at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special "Tornado" units were brought in to counter unrest involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were given help due to minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of staff received assistance due to the injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they will be able to spend a long time behind bars."
Long Lartin Jail is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were summoned to prison to solve a serious situation in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with storm surges (possible benefit for drylands)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest with the rest of the force and poses a risk of turbulent flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the area of western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross right over it on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Hydrometeorological Service said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the edge of the Mughal region of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin there is a probability of rainfall of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of storm surges, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these precipitations could be useful as the southwest is currently under drought.
"According to the U.S. dryland map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," the report said.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the force of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and was moving northward at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening, the coast of Mexico will be approached by the force of a tropical storm.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be strong and poses a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm," the report said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California Peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempting Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stabbing wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton was found an injured teenager.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
The Avon and Somerset police department said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials have called for anyone who has a video of the incident to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered the Anger and Anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charges she brought.
The president said on Saturday that on that day "the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to uphold Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with a flawless career in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans going to mid-term elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said it was the mission of the Democrats to “create resistance and obstruction.”
An aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed, a large number of whom were dragged by huge waves hitting the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday as twilight waves up to six meters high hit the coast, dragging many of them to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed after a magnitude 7.5 quake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the double power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had moved to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get very worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building panicking to warn people down the street about a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications around Palu to be disrupted, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military said it had started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggale successfully arrived in the city of Palu where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in the backyard of their office, they passed on scenes of destruction en route,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a number of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched the aid wheels in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply and engagement of personnel from other countries can only be started if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but such a state of affairs has not yet been declared.”
When Palu fell on the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who still consider themselves missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that alleviated the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's state paraglider team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those held at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagius, were his disciples.
“Given the many years I’ve spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the demolition of the Roa Roa hotel that had spread to the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitions from Palu that participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray checker instead of two blue checkers.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging ATMs in Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from Brink's employee who loaded an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, the other man “came in a race with Brink’s employee behind his back” and stole a bag of money that was to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, who canceled due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously stated that this word had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in a talk about the title of his album with Big Boy radio host.
“So, I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It started with Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, in just Ye – it’s a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use its military against its citizens.
Mexican Presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements began spreading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in that area,” said AI investor and AI expert Kai Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy in principle.
China, meanwhile, unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Doubling the investment could double the chances that by the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, it will come to the United States," Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI is great: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American game player Othello, and later served as director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that leads academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China announced the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations providing funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve business and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Saturday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." This is a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has led to Greece blocking the opening of accession negotiations with the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the abrogation of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments in June agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU while accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko joined the referendum on changing the country's name in Strumica on September 30, 2018, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov stood in front of parliament in Skopje, putting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of a tent set up by those boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required response.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be a success, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke into Brighton's defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday, winning 2-0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely easy, scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through the three players of Brighton's defense and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender, and then overtook a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero, who threw the right-handed dip ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are very happy to have scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League.
That shot was scored in the 29th minute.
During that game, Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton field.
Beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sanea along the left side.
Dreams pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
Manchester City are battling Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop Rockies from advancing
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's win over the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, make it into the playoffs.
The Rockies on Friday night won 5-2 over the Nationals at least securing a spot in the wild-card playoffs, but still hope to win their first title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I’d witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but are reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching room on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-hander from Washington this season scored an 18: 7, the average winning run (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters going to the general election, the president commented on his election of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's another five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big ones — I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race, and that’s why I’m everywhere, to fight for great candidates.”
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control. We won't give them."
The Democrats, he says, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen this over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and lying.”
He hailed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of the Senate, which caused a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer considers different opinions.
It does not tolerate the expression of personal attitudes
I wasn't too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome – and all because we have said what we have in mind.
In my opinion, Joan Ryan's deputy collaborator behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the motion for censorship for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For the greater part of the eight years during which I have worked as a local Labour Party representative, the meetings of the General Council on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings are held in a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
It started not long after Jeremy became a leader, as the collaborators I thought we shared similar political opinions started demanding from me a drastic change of mind and taking positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was a single market or a single EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a whirlwind of insulting words on social media calling for my resignation, waiving center policies and telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been sent to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the toleration of insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every proposal of distrust or change of election rules we become an increasingly narrow-minded party.
“I’ve been advised many times in the last two years to keep my head down so I don’t get so loud and tell me that everything will be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government, which left my multi-purpose school classroom in ruins, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or a minister in government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grappling with Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire that time and energy be wasted on my allegiance to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of repudiation or political gain will deter me from acting as I see fit to be in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership league.
They have now reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of ten teams.
After all, the top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Every honor to Ayra, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunity better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frazier Climo put Ayr in the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by an eleven-pointer before, in the half-time alone, hit a goal and made a stand-alone attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot made, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to the serious injury Ruaridh Knott was carried on the carriers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued the good game by trying Stafford McDowell who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, with Bruce Colvine's unrealized attempt at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to demolish the Clima that didn't have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson made the lay-up behind Ayr in full swing of penetration.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe received a high kick from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of the company's licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a favorite BBC series whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with his longtime comedic partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and it seems Kiernan is planning to dedicate his life to after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though one source for Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the naval center filled with cranes in La Paz.
In public buildings, the flag of the color of the ocean is reported.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are crippled: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of Chile’s lost coastline during resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for re-navigation of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice ruling expected on October 1 after a five-year trial, hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistic about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Plenty of Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit at sea to Bolivia.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will judge in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
A U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “was not complex,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have pushed them back.
“The issue of access to the sea has taken over the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has buried Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the court's view that the decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “an unexpected opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreement,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s favorite presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to go through the past.”
North Korea says it won't have nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would never be nuclear disarmed if they could not trust Washington.
He addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "empty fantasies" and that the US's opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Last Line Of Big Headwear Is On The Road To Luxury Shopping In Your Neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion show presented a line of ripped-out giant headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and thrilled style fans at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats this summer have overwhelmed Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the track.
The outstanding specimen was conceived by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide circumference resembling a feather that completely "taken over" the heads of the model.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to heat your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a windshield and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a big fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of about 60 cm that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that stands behind the extremely impractical hat that subjugated social networks on the fashion track has sent another great creation – a straw bag for a beach almost as big as the model in a bathing suit who wore it.
The faded orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia resins and a white leather handle, was an exhibited copy in Jacquemus' La Riviera's summer collection for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and famous stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer. Since the designer has left such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The language skills that the world's citizens need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and additional weight is given to individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the above school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and preferred subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use the English language if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language learners received excellent grades.
Data collected at 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received an excellent grade for Mandarin, while 72% of pupils learning German, 69% of pupils learning French and 63% of pupils learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of work force with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require knowledge of the language, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, which gives them an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults, 75% of respondents in the UK do not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a bilingual percentage of respondents, or more precisely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their programme, while others will opt for languages considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in this area.
Scottish independent schools provide an environment for children to prepare and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for us.
We cannot ignore the fact that, in today's global business, knowledge of the language is very important for the future of each country, so it must also have an impact on education.
Thus, the knowledge of modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Scottish Independent Schools.
LeBron will play in the Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans will soon welcome LeBron James's first performance for the Lakers from Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes it will play.
“More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans for the Lakers, which consists of six games.
“I don’t really need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins campaigning at numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned gatherings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after a vote in November.
What time does Trump’s meeting in West Virginia start tonight and how can you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be watched online via live streams on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s affirmative decision has been pending for a week before the FBI’s investigation ends.
But the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans gain a lead in November's election.
Trump's campaign headquarters said the five meetings scheduled for next week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"A majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that it will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the tumultuous campaign," an anonymous spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media,” reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the rankings in polls," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left heart on the field before individual clashes on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the Sunday afternoon couples' fight may be just what was meant to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a saying that is especially valid in sport and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Who is the wheel of happiness now favored?
“They had six points advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side right now,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in the lead with four points, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in the back and encouragement from his play in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a full-day game.
Spieth played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering cheers became louder as Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in Spieth's key path to the unresolved result.
After the road that won the game with 15 holes followed a similar cheering cry in which one can recognize the hope and faith that Americans can turn everything around.
“You just need to focus and think about your game,” Spieth said.
All that's left for those players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The European odd, but irresistible pair has a maximum number of points and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, show that they are exactly the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both win at the same time on different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took on Alex Noren and Sergey Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's pairing game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the pitch buried the Spaniard and Swede in a hole from which they were unable to dig.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig themselves out of their holes.
It is fascinating to watch the games of couples close up because you can see the interactions of the players in the pair, hear the advice they give and those they do not give, as well as study the strategy that can be changed in a moment.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs also showed that the US team has the necessary combat, in which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans in the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's pairing games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the US from 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points difference at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy she missed in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the American team in the morning games in pairs, achieving a score of 3:1.
The American team showed greater combat in the pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the Jim Furyk Trophy, eight points must be collected in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood, are only the second pair to win four points in a pair in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and U.S. debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some ingenious moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to get back into the pairing game with partner Henry Stenson and suffered a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkie, the world's first and third best players.
But for Europeans, not everything went smoothly on a pleasant day south-east of Paris.
Triple-winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, putting their U.S. team high.
First they defeated Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in the fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4&3 in the pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was behind four points managed to return to the individual games, although Furyk's team only needed an unsolved result to retain the trophy.
After two days in the rear, it seems that their Sunday counterattack will be difficult to fall.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase distrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant goodwill measures" last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear testing station, and taking a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security. Under such circumstances, there’s no way we’re going to be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current US president and leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work on "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the U.S. has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction in tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on denuclearization and increases pressure with sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes the 'proclamation of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just the delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there are plans for a second meeting of Kim and Trump, which the US president discussed earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the last five months, adding: "If denuclearization had been requested by South Korea, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill."
Despite everything, the tone of Riy's speech differed greatly from that last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said targeting the continental U.S. with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to disarm at the United Nations this year, but added that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea performs denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearization and added: “It doesn’t matter if it’s going to take two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Rio at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands."
North Korea has agreed to a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex that will be realized if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps toward stabilizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on how to get a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I only learn this now, in my last year of college?”
She said that no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at Paul Barreira University said the university decided to introduce a course after students noticed a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During classes, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in full-time learning before exams still exists, the professor says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeat to Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's hit knocked out Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and finished the game with a 1–0 win over Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first host victory after triumphing in February and scoring 4:1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the lead.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to be left uninspired and didn't seem to match the result.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only a one-off difference behind the Hibernians.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on the sides and so countered next to Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same line-up of Livingston as the Hearts last week and would be thrilled that his well-designed line-up had stifled every opponent’s attempt.
The Rangers may have had more of the ball in their possession, but Livingston achieved more with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after Menga was kicked out of the game for the first time, which opened the door for Scott Pittman to move on to Allan McGregor's goal, but the goalkeeper missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an inaccurate blow to the rear ranks.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to eleven in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider the Colombian's request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to direct only two balls to the goal, but for former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, one blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and a pittance shot to Ovie Ejaria was not a big problem.
Although Livingston's 34-minute play slowed the game, no one can deny their effort.
The Rangers again missed to use Jacobs's deep returned ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who retained his presence and chose Menga for a simple end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had an instant effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long shot after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide influx from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again asked for an 11-year-old late because he had a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his gaze this time.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now there's a page from our Almanac on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago...the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The main pillar of science since that time, Geiger's counter has also become the main pillar of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado", in which the main roles were seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it, my God?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look at this, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Bad Cells and Destroy Them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of its treatment.
The procedure involves the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
The cells are treated to “recognize” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer retreated for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting the cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from the patient and their “learning” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
After hosting Saturday Night Live, Kanye West took part in discussions about Trump and backed him, wearing a cap with the cap “Make America Great Again.”
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whistled into the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a show with interruptions in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great Again,” he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they say to me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’”
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech on social media was broadcast by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was trying to screw West with the release.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had been beaten behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
“I was tortured behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that cap."
They abused me!
They said I sank," the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued, "You want to see the bottom?", and said that he would put on his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused at least twice the public's displeasure, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio is silent."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who posted on Twitter: "One of the people with the bravest spirit: Thank you for standing up to the mafia."
But TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “his own and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now be "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of Attempting to Kill with a Knife at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempting to murder a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The indictee is due to appear before the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington leans towards toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jonah Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor leaned on the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be firm in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old co-star from Game of Thrones, has admitted that he wants to "very decisively" face this problem.
“Personally, I feel very determined right now — where did we make a mistake with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, in relation to the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine characters on screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is being taught through TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they have to have those particular traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming sequels to Game of Thrones after it ended next summer and said he had “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November onwards, Kit will star in a new performance of True West by author Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that getting to know his wife Rose was the best thing that had happened to him while filming Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife while filming this series, which gave me family and a future life," he said.
In an Emmy-winning series, Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases of infection are transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that there are almost no people infected with HIV in this way.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be large.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public gave away information about GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had disclosed personal information to three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic lawmaker from Los Angeles says these claims are being spread by “ultra-right-wing” individuals, as well as websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The data allegedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was made public by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosures belongs to Waters’ office, as well as information about the employee representative, The Hill newspaper reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters said.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking that information.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
It has to be calm and steady."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters's reaction to the criticisms Democrats are referring to Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also tweeted.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities” of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Johnny English: Again on a Mission: Rowan Atkinson Fights a Spy (Review)
It is now customary in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems so in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first installment called "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screens in 2011 with the title "Johny".
Will the entangled satire of our own about how obviously worthless we become the new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his ripped eyes and rubbery face is once again allowed to complicate the situation, while his name says more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a vicious secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to the "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a hint of Mr. Bean's character and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song of the 2012 "Chariots of Fire" and the opening ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and which is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's twisted incidents are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's mute gegs embodied in Mr Bean's character.
The presumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker has entered the UK's most secretive spy network and uncovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who is unfortunately briefly portrayed by Kevin Eldon.
It spilled a glass of prime minister’s patience, a superhuman and warlike character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character that should represent Theresa May, but she didn’t really get the material to do anything with.
Intelligence advisors reveal to her that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as a director of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here there are a few handsome gegs because English teaches espionage in the rocker style.
English is quickly taken to government premises for an emergency meeting, where she reunites with Bough, her former partner and her eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential has been largely squandered.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who was portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, a villainous Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: disguised as waiters, a chic French restaurant burns, they challenge a huge mess by smuggling themselves on Volta's luxury yacht, and English challenges a complete anarchy of how to use Volta's virtuality.
Everything was done properly for this last sequel, but as attractive and diffusive as the film was, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a central achievement.
And as was the case with other films about Johnny English, I wondered again, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
Labour denies working out a plan for Britons to work four days a week and get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week and be paid for five days’ work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
The sources say that the idea could be "included" in the party's economic program and plans for the country to favor workers' interests.
The trade union congress has backed moving to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it represents a tendency that fits in with this party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as with this party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to give its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this trend.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from the hands of "innocent directors" and "profiteers" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to repay their full stake as the Labour government could make “deductions” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of private company capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put off a final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s conclusion could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they brought you the quotes, and asked, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved into stone.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should have a strong charge to change that," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has resolutely denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see that anything has changed."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goals.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually considering that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to call for action, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters that have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He says these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the insured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and implementers in the United Kingdom that advocates for “helping children to develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world’s citizens, the targeting will provide a $35 million per tom for aid.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes just a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition Foundation’s ambassador, told audiences at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project that will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds, “It’s going to be a long and hard road and sometimes we’re going to fail.
But we will succeed, as the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us have done, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the performances at this year's New York event that will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russia's energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria “particularly where it acts on the call of a legitimate government” is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why Russia in the Middle East wants to sell energy in the region is because it wants to sell energy in the region, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
But, in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"With the help of the Navy, the United States can ensure the openness of sea routes and blockade, if necessary, to make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the US is portrayed as the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, and for Russia he says it is "using the same trick" in fossil-fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made simultaneously with the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In that sense, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s vehement opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to shun EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country gets involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the senator from the state of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" her candidacy for president after the mid-term elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means the woman in charge,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is going in the wrong direction."
“I’m terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think they should run in 2020.
According to a study by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent voting for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence that took place on Monday evening.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is comparable to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back from,” she told audiences at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem, and for her son and other war veterans, she said that "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the army, gave about the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the city’s police administration.
18 U.S. states and D.C. support review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties submitted a friendly report in Washington on Friday to provide support to an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 that allowed immigrants who have no documents and are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the action, and such obstruction violates that principle,” the court’s friend’s report said.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny immigrants entry harmed the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems—even all the serious problems—that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was more difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she consoled her boy who was shaking in a fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles are coming in every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree quake, were crippled.
Some of the injured, including Dwija Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rested outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continued strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Mistreatment' Through 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday turned to a paid addition to the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "is now doubling this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory because the media is under strong pressure from the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to make an offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle: Republicans push voters away ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
With many Republicans standing alongside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn it will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were extremely upset, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University in Syracuse, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, “November is Coming!”, protesting in the Senate hallway as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court justice’s nominee, analysts hint there could be a negative reaction if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real mess for the Big Old Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but how the Republicans approached and treated him,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats in the election.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with them leaning a little more toward him.
A new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe the truth of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her candidate for Supreme Court justice showed her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing based on Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location where their data is stored and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of commitments, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online storage of data is that it is a decision about who can access which information in full the user.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they will introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would turn completely overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solida."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts State Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War Priests with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honor of the only Anglican priest who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's venture for which he received this recognition.
According to a report by the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal “through a very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and the machine guns.”
He later rushed into the front rows and with "incredible courage" led the squadron forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without anyone's help and mowing the three from the military squadron.
Colonel Vanna was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never achieve, and it arouses humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Pig Peppa
Imagine this <0xCC><0xB6> you will stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches so that you will eventually be unable to track the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other’s match, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig interrupted the broadcast.
Many were not at all impressed after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the interruption of the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Jupi, 'Peppa'."
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about reprisal, I think we can probably fix something,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to implement anything until Sunday starts, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there was a lot of correspondence circulating that wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a problem of a state nature.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to have five fights instead of six, which we're going to do, and we've tried to give our fans more, but we've gone too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ to Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to high school, he wasn’t aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, run by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, took a few months off because of her illness.
Appearing as an apostate on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity in relation to others have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He says he wanted to prove he was “someone and something” so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist has become a prominent person who advocates for LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believed he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re so young you’re going through so much,” he looked back at his first Olympic games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, saying it was hard to find someone the same age without experiencing similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, all the stories would be about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he exhaled, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally became aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
“All I knew was that it was what I’ve been dreaming of all my life of jumping in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0xB6> "Proud" by singer Heather Small <0xCC><0xB6> which echoed in him during preparation for the Olympic Games and on which he always sings .
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to fully return to form to avoid an inconvenient milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing a record 12 times in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and crafting his game on the court in the hopes of correcting what torments him.
Never the most precise player, even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the challenging Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate hits.
And if the field itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who won all four games with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man more than that and could not say.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he kicked me in the back, he hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I figured there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for that,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage in the last day of individual matches of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Danac made his debut in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after observing the result of the 2018 National Team, who won with a score of 10 and a score of 5.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will play with full power.
Get on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is finished until the flooring on the board is answered.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
"I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who is facing us, the biggest players in the world."
Excited by the performance of his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of the ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and it's something completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, you’re on the ultimate test of your golfing skills.
This is a message you have to convey to the players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they have played with fellow players, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those major upheavals last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question as Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this feature moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
So we organized our lineup and set up the boys like, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face other Europeans in the top half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship put back on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The release of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of all-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad, will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached all the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important because Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors <0xCC><0xB6> less than on older Bremen-class frigates.
The ship has also been shown to be dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to weigh 7,000 tons twice as much as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project <0xCC><0xB6> including crew training <0xCC><0xB6> also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the navy actually “does have ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem had increased over time as the old ships were put out of service and there were no replacement vessels.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Foundation is listening to the secret life of a bat
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help lead future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow common and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-tailed and river bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile screenings using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of voting of the bat and what kind it makes.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and arrangement works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as fleas and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says that having an estate is the ideal area for them.
“Here in Threave, we have a huge space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress.”
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Mosquitoes are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Bat Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their populations are progressing.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
An attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video he posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” a five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” added the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at an apartment in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was a "good guy" who was let down by that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he had agreed.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of revenge" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million move.
Brexit: UK to ‘repent forever’ for losing car makers
The UK will "forever repent" if it loses its status as the world's leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, should Britain leave the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston engine, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My position is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production stalls at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Miniy plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just in time” principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not hold more stock at its factory in Derbyshire than it needed in a day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those border checks".
"We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful range of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unity union, said his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go away, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's meddling in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia's possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire a deputy state attorney, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been rife for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing the wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the midst of an announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed much of the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a consequence of a rejection of the TV reporter's "theatrical behavior," though she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are different."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president organizes more meetings to answer questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers."
Short addresses will continue to happen, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you have seen that in the last few weeks, and it is precisely that you can talk to the President of the United States that will replace short speeches to journalists."
Trump regularly gives answers to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff employed by the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a Saturday loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>27, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the line of the playground and just crashed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "detailed details about the type/severity of the injury" and that the Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year playing internship, plays his first season for the Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five downs before leaving the game, achieving a total of 18 downs in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK
Under the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This step will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters to promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and target those with high wages.
The tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will contribute to the Government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional tax <0xCC><0xB6> that is added to the current tax, including the increase that was introduced two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for issuance <0xCC><0xB6> can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents who do not reside in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to join the society of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "towns of ghosts" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs May to renounce quotas on affordable real estate to fix the "shame of the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced proposals for a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-depositions.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to rebuilding the British dream that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable Britons.
The dream of owning a home has gone too far for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
<0xC5><0xA0>kot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading ones.
He moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after leading St. Mirren again last season at the Scottish Football Championship.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only be realised if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
The former head of Alloa Athletica says he did not feel afraid because he inherits such famous names at such a large club, having previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross only completed the third year of his managerial career, after a period during which he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the falls to the champions' title winner next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real cross,” Alloe recalled.
“I really believed that managing is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning solidly, and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of work stress and pressure, but management seems like a real thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

The summer heatwave has increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw an increase in revenue in July by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from a business consultation of the Office of the Chief Accountant, which collected the data, said: "The continuation of the good weather and the participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be more like the previous month of June, when the revenues were even higher than the previous month of June.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much higher profits under the same conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also been hit by the heat, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed breweries and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, while food sales declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the managers of food-serving establishments, and time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand share growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pubs, bars and restaurants industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and an industry benchmark has been established.
One in Five Kids Has Secret Social Media Accounts That They Hide From Their Parents
The study reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news heightened the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, open secret accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake insta accounts” referring to a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a cleared "main" account to show their parents, while at the same time having private accounts.
One mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage boy who was inciting others with the words “force me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that many teens are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice Athlete' at Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her broad experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, out of his total of four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC expert, after a transient ischemic attack he could no longer walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement."
Shared opinions on the Internet about the ad for a traitor that compares mothers with cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who are breastfeeding their children with cows that the husband is aroused by divided opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable traitor,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stall filled with hay and cows with music whose lyrics are: "Yes, I can see myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a rime, these are my breasts."
Then there is the refrain: “Pump out, pump out, I feed the baby with it, pump out, pump out, I man my lady.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "threats" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie's Traitor Discreetly Fits in a Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
The second person comments: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: "Completely unaffiliated advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that her song was “smooth.”
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The release of milk made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit crazy, but I figured it out the way it is.
“It’s a brilliant product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who give out milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who give milk say they feel like a cow.
The Elvie traitor, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the trait.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Elvie’s traitor is so revolutionary that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to focus on betrayal and all its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that Ellie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed in the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their own possibility of staying in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had filed for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor household in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to the shelter workers, with the aim of speeding up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not in person, to bring their case to the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for aid will be deported quickly.
According to statements by shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and that "in accordance with this, they will be dealt with".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of terrorist groups and “any illegal presence of foreigners”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed “some Western countries” for the “spreading of irrational fears” that encouraged the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russo-Turkish agreement has prevented a mass attack by Syrian forces with the support of Russia on a province that is home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda, "who will be eradicated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, the revocation and scandal prematurely end his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There's no sign of spectator murder at the moment.
Since 2014, the number of hits has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama Designated Survivor, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs Scovell said.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch that for six hours you've been watching a group of Trump experts discuss how Bob Woodward used "deep background" sources for his book "Fear," about Paul Manafort's leather jacket worth $15,000, and the impetus of the Post.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
“A part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Zalagaonica,” about the rotating cast and the day-to-day intricacies of Trump’s show.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to be late.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of Kauai Island it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27°C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He could not be separated from television, not until Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung over.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside is pouring into the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently revamped suburban district of Pittsburgh is highlighted by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a second-district seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally curbed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a fight to fund the campaign between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts gave a slight advantage to the democrats.
The U.S. should punish El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraw
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials have decided to invite U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent the movement of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively halted any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History (disambiguation)
The next thing on the table could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
“Mr. Mueller also reportedly focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our election.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to stand before the electorate again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of equals.
There are many 'ifs' and I do not want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr Trum - nor of those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or delays.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that he secretly proposed filming the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?”
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we'll fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewess from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once sat at my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a sabbat candle on that table with a hipped cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing Rapido from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrell earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2 <0xCC><0xB6> 2 rematch with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game believing we could achieve something and we got a point.
Maybe in the end we could have stolen the game, but overall, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday, there is another big European night.
Hopefully we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
"Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Engage health representatives to identify a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider giving you the authority to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure the payment of your bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Keep that plan at hand.”
Man shot multiple times from Ilfracombe air rifle
The man was shot several times with a shotgun while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were disrupted, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggali.
The tsunami also struck western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree quake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree quake hit one of Mentawai Island, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of the building.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on family violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sara Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "innocent of course" when asked about the statement of guilt, the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the blow.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed off pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal grand jury struck a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and blackmail, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and counts of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “abominable, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Dieg Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Dieg Mendoza and Alejandra Seccan nav.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was the last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching an ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting the guilt of life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a rally at a Conservatives conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of a Eurosceptic as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Bone told reporters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been “out” by now if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is underscored by Tories prone to a remnant who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan "Chequers" amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of the remainder and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was the boss, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers.”
He said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone rejected the statement that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely inaccurate."
Conservative and Brexiteers Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, addressing reporters in words: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message, Mrs May added: “Premiers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told rallies that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are to betray a decision made in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘you’re not going to get through this.’”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not settle down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remnant marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Many activists waved "Torijevic against Brexit" banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for the undisturbed border situation, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s all a complete farce.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday in a live chat with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time now that it could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means the woman in charge."
Arrested for murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the fatal outcome of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET news conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, seeking help in identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene and owning a gun and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the top 10 teams last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a big role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into circulation at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action wheel-to-wheel, which left the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the interior at risk of falling behind after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race while relying on his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it to the 44th round of boxing, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and it was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really great job to achieve a formation finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianna Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence on not releasing a letter to the public by Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “evil and ugly and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the publication and leaking of information to the public, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document to the public – ‘aa, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let ... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t let her story go public,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep her a secret and I kept her a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "To tell you something - that was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars acquitted themselves for a loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a win in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5 <0xCC><0xB6>3.
The Giants took advantage in the early minutes of two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's game opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaull, assisted by David Rutherford for doubling the lead by Beauvillier four minutes later.
In a rushed opening match, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a draw in scoring power by goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time at the end of the second third, and he took care of the win when his team was already halfway to the win in the last third of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are the hosts of Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of planes with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are reported missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport’s control tower, which was rocking heavily.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air on Flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken for that,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sighi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing, as many bodies are still under debris and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached heights of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles are bringing bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it was unable to track a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were held in hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waists to the exit in case of a plane that sank.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank to about 30 meters of water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst exposes weather survey of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used mobile phone data to compile a plot about the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The data from the cell phone indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense should begin its final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Awareness?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based singer-songwriter group The High Breed claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are born again in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York-based nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “another black girl.”
The couple denies they are racist, comparing the accusation to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned on her first day of work in 2016 that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"No more black women," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "unfortunate" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice, she claims, because their former nanny, who was African-American at the time, was doing her job too badly for the New York Post, and that instead of her, she was putting up with the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then she went home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a termination fee and seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month period for which he was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The pair responded to claims that they were racist, saying it was reasonable to do so because of fears that they would not be able to trust her because of the insult afterwards.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in a situation like this.
“That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in a letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will read the book for the first time before publishing.
It’s very fun what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC recorder before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with years of happiness and sadness after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important member of the family,” she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a braggart,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was all experienced as a kind of achievement of your own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited Paddington exclusively."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye over the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad and that they believed he would not get away with it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart working slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then everything turned off.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were not aware of the temptations she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I dropped my head, and my tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who are left without loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill any room with joy.
However, before his death, he left work because he was in “a really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I am constantly worried that it will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with cards “so that people would know that there is someone you can go to and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies's, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom, when the children opened the presents, he didn’t look them in the eyes or want anything else.”
She said that his death had been a major trauma to them, but that they had to get through it: “It leaves a big hole in the family.
Kida us.
But we will continue to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs over as FBI investigates
“I thought we might be able to bring a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was looking for in a timely and scope-limited investigation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” amid a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness is prompted by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, on November 6th, if Republicans are not expected to pass well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to get the man they want to lead to the election of the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Referring to data from the United Southern Union ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of refugees from the north eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks that focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work on liberating the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it is not considered that under such circumstances we disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical,” says he is incapable of serving in Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidate "hysterical" and said she was incapable of serving on the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like that, would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the recital, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "gross and coordinated slander" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved she could not participate in the Supreme Court's work because it showed she had prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Asked if he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi stalled.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a federal appeals court judge in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade lawsuit, as she is seen as a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about whether he would alter some Supreme Court rulings.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’”
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years, all of this cannot be removed without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was once the CEO and who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique that, when she gets angry and starts crying, says to the person she’s talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, once when I was crying over an unspeakable rage, an elderly woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason not to consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
They were called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already overdue, it lagged behind in fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she said she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions—gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism—that she shook her head.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” said Mrs. Schroeder of the media’s reaction to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what I was going to put on my tombstone.
"She was crying."
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the US and China has resounded loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing has somehow retaliated, and recently a tariff of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods has been introduced.
China has promised that the United States will respond to the blow with a blow, and the world's second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by easing demands, but public subjugation to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for launching an economic collapse in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers thought,” said Abigail Grace, a U.S. strategic think tank focused on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence are now fulfilled.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would benefit from assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, on hole 16 par 3, sent the ball into the water in the first shot, leaving the match to Frances Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was knocked out by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop my tears today.
The year was tough.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
It’s all up to the team. I’m happy to be able to help,” said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in the individual games on Sunday, with a 2&1 result.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is immediately behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain moments, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to overwhelm ourselves, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take people's hats off.
We're overplayed."
