Austria’s right-wing populists have a 29 percent share
The noticeable weakening of both sides of the large coalition so far and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Corutan hero Jörg Haider, is planning a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democracy Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last election of 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who provoked the early elections, a literally catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP withdrew from the coalition, the people had a significant lead in preferences before the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
Voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party's chairman and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's presidency.
Such a development would seem to facilitate the path to the increasingly likely outcome of the election, i.e. the resumption of the grand coalition of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) gained provisionally 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition in 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united, and in 2005 the European Union voted to join the BZ<0xC3><0x96>).
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously betting on this development.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it lost slightly and fell between Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% limit and did not get into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India could cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused of illegally collecting bugs in India could not be solved, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg.
The minister said this in New York after a meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
After the meeting, Mukherjee said that the executive power could be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>chy, who was acquitted and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the case falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>er, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He can then ask for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same during the meeting.
"He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter the whole matter is to provide the convicted persons with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance to them.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize that as well," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider it a profound mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
Answering the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters, the minister avoided.
"I've got quite a few promises," he said.
The Czech Republic judges the fight for the seabed
Access to a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjoining sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small dot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally supplements it.
There is a spirit of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Petroleum, ores and other minerals can be found here, as well as previously unknown living organisms that carry the key to the development of an anti-cancer drug.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to vehemently apply for new underwater territories.
Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, they exercise their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
It has exclusive rights under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
“Simply put, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often beyond two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far examined five requests, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
A recent global outcry noted the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater countries.
But New Zealand has also won - the size of the seabed that the commission granted to it last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits they will make from the exploitation of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will submit their applications as well.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, declared by the convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
No state has an exclusive status here.
The right to mine in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is no Klondajk," says Director Mikulka, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it, as well as the investors of a few other states, gained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is split there, it's some kind of underwater replica of the Tater.
"It is possible to mine there on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such specificity to the sample.
It resembles a small potato or, with a bit of fantasy, a fabulous sham that, according to legend, revived Golem.
German Special Deployment Units Were Released From Hostages
The Egyptian government asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts arrived.
When the situation deteriorated, special forces were prepared, but the deployment did not take place.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven abducted European tourists in Egypt are gradually being released to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
According to the statements of the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the German counter-terrorism group GSG9, aircraft of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the site of the liberation.
However, according to a further statement from the two ministries on Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the interior ministry's spokesmen.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages moved in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At the moment, they are rescued in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
There is no information available in Berlin as to when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should depart with special forces from one of the Airbuses of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress dropped a $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones Index fell sharply.
By 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program to alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
With the dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for a vote of approval before the MP, although, he said, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors feared that the state bailout could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to drop sharply once the package failed.
Experts are now anticipating further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel Agents Record Growing Numbers of Bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, bookings for trips in the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent even in the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans’ desire to travel remains undiminished.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded an increase of 31 percent in turnover compared to the same period last year, according to the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased bookings available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover was thus about eleven per cent higher in October compared to 2007.
The results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included bookings of trips that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is mainly requested, the DRV said.
For these routes, the increase in bookings is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly sought after by the Germans.
Above all, the organized tours are in course, said the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing expenditure on energy and food, the costs are "easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that, among other things, consumers can save money by using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so there will again be higher turnover compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endless repeating beer, beer from tumblers and prominent in cuts from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer garden.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: we are not even three minutes on a beer meadow, and photographers are already throwing at us and filling up memory cards - that's what makes me cringe, because I'm at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I am here as a tourist and live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a women's cut or leather pants; no one looks disgustingly or embarrassingly affected - everything is completely normal.
Only my apron picks up the special views at the banana stand in chocolate.
One of the nuns pointed out to me that I had wrongly bound her: "You are now free, in the middle of a virgin, on the right, widowed in the back."
I'll put the sweaters on the back left.
"Okay," he said, laughing.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't do that much and wear simple felt hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and shove on passing naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he is from England and he also came to the Oktoberfest for the first time.
Seems "gorgeous" to him, with an extended "ooo".
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved himself of the maze he's been drinking.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as they are called in Bavaria in public by people who freely urinate.
Others do not have the happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, the Oktoberfest area is crowded with health professionals who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Healthcare professionals always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the veil of this coffin of love is not seen.
"It's just the ones that can't go any further," one of the doctors calls in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police release the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a sixty-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was published.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon struck Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish periphery.
On the eastern bank of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1> railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
The tour guides will tell you.
The building sits circumferentially at the end of the platform with a tower on each corner of the front, overlooking the indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gateway the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium of Anatolian-Baghdadi Corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the late game of empires, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East using this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their trains were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1> station, too.
In 1917, an explosion of a munitions train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually squatting and history is circumventing it.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a curling ride on the tracks, which reminded the old-world rhythms of the well-known document Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to go back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
There were suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, purposely built on a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-developed department stores and power shops, where middle managers in business dresses - men and women - meet to
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
“The party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey was cut off from its ambush.
Today we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He must have done both.
"But there will surely come a time," I asked, "when will Turkey possibly have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not wish that such a decision had to be made."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea area are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey is.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go along these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, after another mostly waking night, I thought of the two German lords Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were watching this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited at the port for a ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded an excellent youth choir Proteus for the year.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, a few of us were nearly 30 —we simply refused to give up that choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape-changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to engage in any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astounding, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the passion for music that remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it then! "
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor majestic.
No matter where the standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “pulled one or two suckers around the world.”
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's commentary in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition Flamenco and Life because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was fascinated by the simplicity and the powerful charge with which he acts on the viewers, and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resin can capture magical moments."
Honda will attack for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-seater vehicle already had a lot of space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is complemented by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution, rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-space car.
We should mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time than other manufacturers to rejuvenate this model.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in sales in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with about half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda is aiming to increase the sales of the new Jazz in its category.
While the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz in 2007, in 2009 it estimated 100,000 cars, which would represent an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz model since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish branch expects sales of 2,000 units throughout the year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The company’s management thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid compact with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units worldwide per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will split the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year, when it will be unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all the dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), its width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and its axle spacing to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also led to an increase in interior space.
This advantage was achieved on the one hand by using a new platform, and on the other hand by placing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4-engine version, as the luggage space of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a panoramic glass roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of the Honda Jazz also has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and delivers excellent drive system enhancements at the same time as high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, the current one will reach 100 hp.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
This time around, Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically by bees, to make progress in the development of accident-protection technologies.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the model of flying bees, and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Robot Center for Technical Progress have developed, in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, CEO of public relations for technology, research and development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-zone safety shield.
The task of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are the folded bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles up to two metres in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of an object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and in a direction that is possible by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to preserve itself according to this data.
It does not require information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but we’re not talking about the gig or the mega.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage
It should be recognized that the US Department of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack inventiveness.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with dubious solvency, she created a popular online science game "Bad Credit Hotel".
Not a bad credit hotel... or a messy hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look gloomy to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there is a dream room.
At least something, because I prefer not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Bank House Morgan Stanley has announced that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, will spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital, following a sharp decline in its exchange rate.
A week after they unveiled their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing another $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and a foreign exchange price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation will be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley’s shares, however, lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 at around 17:00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest ace on Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms introduced on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and also cover up.”
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their carrying amount.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the share of about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares per year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price above 50 % of the exchange price, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the group’s spokespersons refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15 %, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "substantially" reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock market rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against default risk associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs were reversed on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” from major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establish a republic around socialism of the 21st century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to the vote, following the example of his peers and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
"No" according to these results gained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted east of the polling stations and calculated by NGOs predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, ranking it in the range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa called for the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, was about a text on 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy by reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly on oil production by foreign companies and on the currencies that its emigrants send.
The Correo-protected proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution, among other things, consolidates the principle of free health care and education that the president began to implement in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it is also counting on a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus terminating the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
Nineteen hostages freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando attacked the hijacker of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive for ten days in the desert, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian commando liberated them in Chad.
The commanders arrived at around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, just adjacent to Cairo's international airport.
They were immediately transported, without the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban residential district of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the hijackers," Egypt's tourism minister Zohejr Garrana said on the runway of the airport.
Since their capture on Sept. 19 during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard director of Aegyptus, safari organizers.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of the special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters fled during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "blitz" unit were sent to Sudan, where they gained the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle with the kidnappers on board, killing six, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were affiliated with the rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Silent majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with inch headlines and is the subject of the current election campaign.
The better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to plunder the poor sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that die of starvation?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organizations, in concert.
In Quebec, a federation of Quebec history societies, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 history, monuments, archives, and genealogy societies seek to uncover history, preserve private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few minors.
Often, it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our monuments, who protest hopelessly as promoters and leaders dump their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we finally going to get to the History and Monuments Tribune?
The Benelux Governments will form the national part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effects of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: three countries will support the billions of dollars and an insurance institution, which has a shareholding in Ma<0xC4><0x91>aru.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to enter a major crisis in the wake of the global financial market crisis, which has been raging for more than a year, and the decisions made on this matter could be seen as precedent in some respects.
In terms of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
With absolute certainty, the bank will sell part of its capital holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares of Fortis began to decline sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it fail.
The company’s securities fell 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, but according to the company’s executives, this is unrealistic.
The company’s management is also blamed for the decline in Fortis’ overseas market uncertainty related to the adoption of the $700 billion US package.
Shares rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, the new CEO of the bank, was appointed to head the bank.
The Monetary Institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed up yet.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank’s clients and the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people’s data on the purchase of drugs, often reject the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescribing data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox," Richard Dick, the author of the drug-prescribing program, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance payments and amounts paid in the event of insurance incidents depending on the health of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as being too large, they will not insure with it.
Previously, they sent those concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacies will easily find out what drugs he has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself derives, what he suffers from the disease and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that it has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately places it in the category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk factor at the same time, so that the insurance company has almost no work left in addition to paperwork, although there are minor problems.
Disadvantages include the fact that licker drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds can be used, for example, against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurance companies, these represent a significant risk-increasing factor, while the aforementioned problems are not.
For the purpose of requesting and processing the data, special companies have been set up to obtain the necessary information from the pharmacies and ask the patient for permission.
The authorities are now forcing them to do so, although they have not been punished for their previous negligence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine data on the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it will be increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which gives the authorities the power to control even companies specializing in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he developed his program so that the transfer of data is tied to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that he can hardly refuse the permit in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are kind of referred to the fleas of good will.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade turnover.
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this topic led, among other, mostly global issues, to the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, with a focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have not yet managed to find a common denominator on the issue of support for New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even further discussed at yesterday's ninth summit, which was held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that the turnover of trade in five years will double to more than a hundred.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In light of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India have been legally agreed, so that air transport will also be green in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy has promised that negotiations will be accelerated.
While the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The Summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, in all its forms, both sides condemned and called for a speedy convening of the UN conference.
They also called for the conclusion of the round of trade negotiations in Doha, although both have a large share in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, which is that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed that at next year’s climate conference it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and reduce greenhouse gas production by fifty percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is on his way to the French capital, where he is preparing to conclude a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that French companies will be given the mandate to build 20 billion euros worth of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries at this edition, who will take 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The wreckage was discovered on a single plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Southern Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dismissed the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure this is exactly where Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) announced that hours after the wreckage was detected, an investigation team was dispatched to eventually identify the aircraft: it is a Bellanca 8kcab, unknown since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their homes in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fosset's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a plane and without landing.
His many records also include flying at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional processing that the communication will be unexpected and unconventional, which will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which accompanies the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will get the impression that the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its trifles, and then re-assembled into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying with this advertisement to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way?
Now we know who the Italians are.
Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never made excessive problems.
She never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc has made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all by name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasl, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had previously committed offenses from the stadium, were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won't go to any stadium anymore.
Well, good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," Viminal said.
So, "well-opened eyes, mainly because of the national game on Wednesday in Le<0xC4><0x8D>a."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio meets, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on even one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of precisely the problems in the stadiums.
"Church Leader-Leader and tense arms during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria it's not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenic Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way), who is a few weeks the director of the Viminal Observatory (he got a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the Quaestor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist,” Osservatory One adds, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far this group has remained within limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistling at the Mameli hymn: neither is it a crime, but if you allow it, it is uneducation...”.
