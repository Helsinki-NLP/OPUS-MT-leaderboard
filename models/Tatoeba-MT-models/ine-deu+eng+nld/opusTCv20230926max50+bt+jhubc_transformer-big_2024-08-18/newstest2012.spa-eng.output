Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the excommunication of the former minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia that was unfavourable for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet finalized, and the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for its approval.
The Victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is about elucidating whether it is moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional Sharia law, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already go forgetting to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably not suitable for the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When victors are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the Sharia don't cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual States have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-on-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer focused only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew year-on-year by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Interannually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but quarterly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest rate on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualifying with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1: 0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that will not miss the European championship event.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Due to the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup event, so the national football coffers will receive an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, a good offensive game was played.
Both teams were only committed to keeping the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon Tuesday in front of the facilities and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred college students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked on.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran is all indications that it is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli sources say it would reach not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity affecting 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where you grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children are fed, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children in families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and almost 900 children of Basic Education from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and enough family exercise are determinants, which make the number of overweight and even obese children significantly decrease.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five diet-based meals a day: breakfast, lunch, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet.”
No breakfast but with built-in for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children consume insane French fries much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet sodas is especially alarming," the study's final report warns.
The main food is the palm pasta and closely followed by the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the study results note.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet soda, where many children would start to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences by three industry professionals, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the show world.
And it'll get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers from overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the Jennifer Lopez type, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so large that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to dress clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I’m afraid that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream from the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained about one hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena G<0xC3><0xB3>mez.
The dresses we have to cut them from the magazines or search them on the Internet and print them, and then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (concrete topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All of this was told to us by the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information about all kinds of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench coat) can be dressed to the classic with jeans and T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just grab it and raise your neck to get a completely different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes on the reservation than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that the image and style alone represent, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it should be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a size very different from their real (smaller).
Then it remains only to glimpse and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the topic, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to be oriented in fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss them, he defends their opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her dressing room and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t take and throw away everything that was and say, ‘There’s some horror.’”
“Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have there all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, hair clippers, or must-haves. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or caps), special clips for hooking clothes in front, if this was larger (pins and other kind of hooks are not allowed), as they could cost a lot of money.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to put on the sole of the shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the outside could be damaged.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to accidentally damage them.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to professional stylism is not a pink path, but it does not matter what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is a race across America.
Rese<0xC3><0xB1>a
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated due to a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during tomorrow’s shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but that was of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, aroused high expectations already before its premiere.
It promised to give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, after all, it appears as a game that should not end up being again a genre of action without more.
We are also curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is usually the case in the NFS series, the results don’t vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called mistakes, but rather it is the incomprehensible ruse of programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to get ahead of a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to win time (timed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you might expect (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But to a race conceived with enough action this style of driving is quite suitable, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Games like this can not be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled wheelbarrows.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no major problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled in such a way that when you have an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, not even resetting helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrived five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It doesn’t matter when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
Opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it is in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at the beginning you can make the car papilla.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t beat the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because that is where you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog online feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
By car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start to run in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the subway convoy arrives behind you and takes you straight ahead.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be liked by most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is rather confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks.”
"It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, said in a statement.
How not to take seriously his motto "clear and open about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers of the U.S. Carolina Law School.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also considered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if it's insulting, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them, and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of representative of Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union in the face of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> has also taken care of the agenda that follows, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good riot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU budget for seven years has to be approved, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will receive more support and which will receive less, something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreign language or jargon that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels – curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, you've already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?' and it turns out that he doesn't make any fun of it."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, is waiting for new tough fiscal policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of two speeds," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated among member states, not just among eurozone members.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to search for a term that would very accurately define IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has already been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prosperity in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared for his employees as the entrepreneur of Bata in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms, and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded top inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.
From the very beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, I could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, with which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, a rain of online ideas, from which a myriad of future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are ideas, since almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, IBM has maintained an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both computers and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include ATMs, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM has become the second-largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on progress, you cannot emotionally anchor yourself in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And this is the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily engaged in services, of which approximately one-fifth is programmed and one-fifth is equipment.
However, even in 1990 the equipment accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM is acting on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Economic Crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that until now the company IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratospherically to 120%, the company's net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "ticking clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM’s founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and began the company’s great expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which introduced the computer standard of the time, came on the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive, high-value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e., “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not improved, for example in terms of transport and city management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently unveiled the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. Also here there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45) but also her mistress, Darina remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from her pink sleep and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even bid him farewell forever.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live not as my dear old Borrico who was mistaken, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that she had already disengaged herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Joseph does not care that his wife has closed the back door for him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
“I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible.”
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
“The company is still in place, I make the arrangements at home, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.”
“Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is we don’t share a bed,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are mentioned that manage to boil the blood of men?
Going shopping
Do you blame your average orange for being dependent on shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one traipette a week?
Do you like to buy often at auctions?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should soothe their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores without further ado, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a pastime, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear those phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean windows, vacuum, rub the floor, remove dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for treading on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make nasty comments
"Used panties are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you do these comets to your partner more times a day, know that you will be able to get him out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything bad, you just want everything to be in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Defamation and gossip
Some women also get the slanders, the gossip, but also the insults and the conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes misses a small and harmless gossip.
With a hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and often do it, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and took one more step and was declared the best player in the game.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jagr's partner, Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jagr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a big night.
"Before the game, I told him I'd make a triple."
"Introduced him."
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," explained Jagr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal after the Flyers first draft.
A little later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek made the record behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first pause a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Particularly for Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds's goal room.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t mean to say he’s the best player on the court, but he’s definitely in the top three,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said.
“It never occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very satisfied with it."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results,” J<0xC3><0xA1>gr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, penalty, until he got to a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, although they were outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He unleashed the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired by an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
“Finally, but there’s nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“So much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time in most cases sold travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a currency exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the currently favorite destination, Croatia, could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighboring Western European states, causing a huge surge of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or board.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned, sausages, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel, agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare for travel using charter flights, which made the prices of travel incredibly low compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, and it went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart every year. This winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15,000 Czech crowns per capita have been spent on trips abroad, including spending on the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up again at a dead end.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hasek era, a controversy erupted between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that point on, and because of this one point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning from the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian part, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pack<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all the candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted on as much as possible in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who is directing his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk will be decided on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and in this way it will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
“In any case, I hope common sense will prevail,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian Sports Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the lotteries house Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k will struggle to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, knew before the extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), nor would he present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I wouldn’t run for election.”
"But to this day, no such person has been found," Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Packl to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, in case of victory, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say they don’t even want to identify with Czech football right now.”
“I’d like to change that view,” he adds.
What allegedly annoys Pack<0xC3><0xAD>k at this time is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general assembly.
For Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will take even less advantage," Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a telephone wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
“I don’t know what prestige football could bring to Pelta’s victory.”
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that "I would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In case of winning Thursday’s election, Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as head of representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel capable," added Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September raised a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrator Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He relies on his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k said without hiding his dislikes towards Spartan President Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it was putting pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues the new president should be dedicated to.”
"If they raise taxes on gambling, as advertised by political parties, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to end up," he said.
In addition, Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R President must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically ceding my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general meeting, so this postponement of two months could do him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president this Thursday.”
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta warned.
Precisely the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to answer in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, try not to mess with your opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It has been a long time since Thomas Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k was attacked, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with his head.
“It’s been over a year in the world of football, and it’s already achieved some success.”
“Their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“Also, I would try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately after that I would be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not involve any personal change to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly manage to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the Fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to solving the Bohemians’ case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, raising more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"I don't mean that I would do it all by myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies so that each member can engage in a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.”
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and obstruct me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
“A lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith not to give up like that, no more,” he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that he has already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose now is over.”
"There are processes that have been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to what it was before the time of Hasek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are mostly all those people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few elected people."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
“I want to make a football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I intend to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and another morava part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It wouldn't be the current situation where we only have three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which has elected me as its vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl said, whose successes include saving some tens of millions of crowns from disadvantaged contracts, televised contract negotiations and negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Packl<0xC3><0xAD>k, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already begun and would not significantly change the staff on the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being in the water is found.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Leaning back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathroom culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that bathroom enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine odor, while runners can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful trios of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools have to always be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the essential sauna oils. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are attended to, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of flooring, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything folds optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it wants to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, the waters with nitrates are located in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of a bottle.
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The <0xC3><0x96>tztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while from the bottom the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas-oil plague is so severe that people think it has reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose ligament sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for the bath, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschauitz, she found a landlocked.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the red, white, and yellow Modernist building, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
Decadence was counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the style of the Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural in the Black Forest.
“It has much merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw material business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate’s campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, betting on commodities was designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The top experts agree that players have decoupled from the offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: “Wettes at rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann is the largest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price wagers,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of people who go hungry or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will change something different from what was unplanned on the board.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And you just need to care about potential losses, that’s what your successor will deal with.
Two-Thirds Would Cancel Investment in Raw Materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that would bet on food prices.
Many of the bank’s clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, stood empty and collapsed.
It now reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern post-gerra architecture is passionate, clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is still considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's South Station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the museum belvedere, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, ice skating artist in her youth, later in Sotheby’s, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public and private funds.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookshop and an office building should also be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the contest, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", where he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer," said Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still Schwanzer's pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it used to be.
And all this with strict control on the part of the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says, warning of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion “that came from Brussels” has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical “casual appearance in the history of the city”.
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a stroke of luck urbanism. The completely new and planned "central station district", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck happens: House 21 could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring location in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn Plans Winter Crisis Package of Millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the investments planned until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this, a better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered an axle break at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays billionaire fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems weren’t enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in a deal to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to pay back the losses of millions.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other major banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of questionable mortgage securities, they are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble erupted in 2007, it led to the demise of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, there is currently a tricky wind blowing for US banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or penalize for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
He blames the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also Deutsche Bank has a claim from the FHFA, it is business worth 14.2 billion dollars from the year 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Contributes $10 Billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett recently revealed on CNBC that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing about the engagement so far.
He praised the direction that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock market shares rose by one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that rekindles itself.
The murders of eight small-business tricks and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, this news has been reacted with fear and concern.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost who was thought to have died long ago returns, from the bombings in the form of fire in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, there has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, let alone, predictable.
"Does the bloody ideology revive again?", headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcaster "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the column title of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are very critically discussed.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not searched long before for suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, immigrants are lost here, they have nothing left but self-defense and armaments."
"This will be the best self-protection."
“Germany’s internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then mainly criticized the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen arson attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what contributes to the taxes the Turks of Germany.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country is since then.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Bank of the Lake Zurich Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was announced that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly delighted, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future companions.
"USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am delighted to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all security systems of the bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been expected to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor, and has had a period of adaptation that is certainly necessary.
He suddenly becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it deserves the title of "the biggest bank in Europe scandal" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared in the past so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also handsome, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, at $1.6 trillion, USB handles more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s big banks.
That's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always rated USB as the model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To cope with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, resigned in 2006 at Switzerland’s second highest-paid board of directors.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed to having more or less helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through wrong speculation and in asset management through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was getting quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, that this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Banking.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the world's greatest goods: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks’ security deposits were a symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli’s authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewellery such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy swivel door.
Inside the walls are coated with marble, in front there are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both major banks.
UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was obvious.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" (The UBS crash in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up with it?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank is emerging that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of UBS: a rich but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to take a step from learning at the bank to the summit."
Eventually, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: The delusion came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the CEO meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some of the steps went well.
In forex trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the consultants of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of "fixed income" banking, there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to securitise American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks at its own expense.
And also, like other banks, they have been looking for the down payment for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a bank expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The positions at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job almost impossible.
You need to find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decline a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he insisted: He must permanently run UBS’s business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-nineties.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask right now.
So far he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors early this week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain ineffective.
The slowdown in industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing in its origin a crisis caused by debt.
General relief from the changes of government in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming back to the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed with a 0.6 percent drop to 12,078 points.

Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistics office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe can’t get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from his point of view it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the American technology sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s stock trading and makes it trade against the trend in the market at first just a percentage higher.

Smart Degrees Extend in Cities
In many places grajos are considered "problematic birds": these highly intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors about the dirt and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means has appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The grajos no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on grajos in Lees, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grades; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing buildings and falling trees that house them make it difficult for birds to live.
The grasses are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district’s hordes jumped to negative press headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
“By expelling and driving them out in a normal way, you get nothing,” said Werner Klöver, a town planner and landscape designer for Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often undesirable consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Throwing them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of deterring animals from sensitive residential areas and bait is possible for them to resettle elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against animals in order to treat them in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a spike in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Gravel Teaching Circuit, where signs inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms for the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grajos not only use resources to access shale bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four degrees how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone onto a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall onto the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning grades had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the barrel shooter.
Three of the four grads achieved it on the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 away game, made all five Eurocup appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with outsider Montenegro, after in the away game (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored Portugal's other goals.
Former Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started out perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free kick from more than 30 meters to get to the top in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his talents to score from far away and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not dress up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, leader of England Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Next, Ergolding's colleague Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark called for a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The European champion of 1976 is qualified for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the lap of the front, very just in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper's fender, the forward of FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end ruled the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey has taken advantage of the wonder of Zagreb’s football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was due to leave his third-tier seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim also could not send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the pause, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took over Ivan Perisic from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who won 4-0 in the away game prepared for a previous decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the outset, the defense avoided possible lead goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he advanced.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, achieving 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China

Last year, it generated approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software vendor’s businesses employing 50,000 workers worldwide are doing just as well as rarely in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We currently want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through broad instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story about World War I, “begins with a long personae drama of the kind that can cause one to drop one’s soul at one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelist narrative, and this dramatic personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
“The beauty and pain of battle” combines the wartime experiences of roughly 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administratives.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund’s book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the Western front.
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" expertly moves through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall upon the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intangible problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordita.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
“The absence of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters, and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivations and fixing them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl, she says, "Succeed them, everywhere replace them."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peelings of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 allowed meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian tabarian behind that."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to “a convicted man being strangulated in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in fine clothing who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both noble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and soak their genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects how war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels such as No Newness on the Front of Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, ripped from your fingers that page of dramas personae, and burned it with a match.
After a false precedent step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night was chosen from Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “occupiers.”
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking toward Zuccotti.
Officers increased so-called disorder training — counter-terrorism measures involving rapid mobilization of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“To the few cops I know who were called in for this, they didn’t tell them it was to get into Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of demonstrators emerged early after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the city district — dozens of mobile agents who routinely flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with lights and loudspeakers converged at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages ringing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left.
No shops were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen meeting on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Chief Spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated harshly by agents.
Mr Browne said the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of demonstrators’ personal belongings, including luggage and trash bags packed with paper and plastic clothing, Department of Cleaning equipment followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked between them by their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “alteration of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esp<0xC3><0xB3>sito, the head of the department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, “was not directing the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen widening the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air out of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for redundancies
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, the 37th municipal district, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid workers lost their jobs on October 7, in a move union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city’s access to a health care fund in charge of working groups.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, education councillor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in the city’s poorer schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically.
While there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36’s budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school's payroll to a work grant, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in excess.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for U.S. participation to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their "successful rebellion and U.S.
“This resolution is to honor Libya’s brave ones as they begin rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a statement of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed with each other and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to be voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory — with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's leading Republican.
The spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors – especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes – the opportunity to brag that they were the “authors” of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can fulfill, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and filed 66 at the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Knocked but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in the face at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway melody "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he surprisingly returned to the House to cast his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked him how he was feeling, Giffords, 41, replied, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords’ recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, she sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A tingling of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word – “toast,” a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that the music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who undergoes two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been hit.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their posts around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as some sort of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are commended for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, service members say.
The public is acting more and more like those uniformed ones are pitying them.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted in silence and private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to end the rape.
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First lady Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a packet of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, throwing her down and raping her, she claims.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after their trial.
Burke says he's going to the Army's top floor, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the military to modernize too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to give them leave of service - a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Rights Action Network, a group in Service.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the assaults are remarkably under-reported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, it accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial — half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he denounced the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor—a cut in her arm—was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked if he had had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was put in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commanding officer, ""That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was exempted from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that holds it accountable.
And he adds, "The odds are strong against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will queue his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs,” he says.
"Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a killing in Norway in July that left 77 people dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time leading up to his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the UK’s DEMOS study centre.
Facebook’s personal information bias is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way vendors have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and her colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a totally new way to do an investigation,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in Likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is driving a boom in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t get close to with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook removes all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunks.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would not otherwise be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “pushing” its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using information that can be accessed - long-standing digital freedom advocates argue that the site should make research available to others).
However, Facebook users know the site is watching, like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with students’ public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen are still the best research tools that no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social – and a lot of social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes His First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brains of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he was locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill person, and said there is no evidence that he has acted with accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I’d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown in a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the product’s business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flowcharts – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
It had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly reissued archival material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which arrives at Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to move faster toward more important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years in the business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way the costs were recorded — often starting with a “standard cost” that was made in the eye of the beholder, and then adjusted to a “variable” — he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine retail business costs.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the “Blue Box” he built himself with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and yelling through the public phone and going back a minute later to the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About Improvising Innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he asked a client if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working with just 30 credit days, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... I was screaming that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About Big Business Losing Strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of his market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, and what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On Innovation as an Artistic Expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all boils down to taste - it boils down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law rivals as court accepts case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept President Obama’s healthcare law challenge, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit to process and, in fact, a historic five-and-a-half-hour allegation is expected by March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its height by the time the court’s decision is known.
The attorney who will appear in court and argue that the law must be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a group that has long been dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-defying trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and a stated opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which states: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive ethical gap and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“Judges were hosted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they too easily mix court activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from looking at the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial for now.
Kagan has given no indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes goes up to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest ever order for commercial jets for its value in dollars – 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs – is not so harmful, because the country is making money with rising oil prices.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep track of its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the violent state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly outperformed Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who had led the polls before the election.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate from his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently holding the post of governor, was third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive aimed at smugglers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A NAP mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacy out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s election may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, with a view to next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avert a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe’s difficulties in an “unbiased” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s 1 billion two hundred thousand people, of whom as many as 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and going on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in jobs from mismanaged companies, and generating losses such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's Serious Warnings About Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily detach many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage goodwill.”
Cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While funding for wartime accounts in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions to basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
“The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime suppliers, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We strongly oppose this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result that one can live with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing difficult decisions.
At a news conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what could be ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an aerial wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions “generate significant operational risks: delays in crisis, conflict and disaster response time; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter aircraft, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its proponents say it is the next vital step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "pilled" with an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner ridiculed his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lives it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton while lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That’s for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you”, the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, bark, blush or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, make them feel comfortable, manage their own emotions and intuitively feel how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more “self-oriented lies,” while women tell more “other-oriented” lies—usually to protect someone’s feelings—that married people lie less often to their partners than people who are not married (but they tend to be afraid to lie).
We also know that if you are perceived as a villain, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps to provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when they see their feet tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview mood swing” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely suggest that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the time spent while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted after U.S. threat of delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and it is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that it will take a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes to avoid the areas of Nebraska’s Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast groundwater supply, are studied.
“This is a real path of progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the State Department, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project raised only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The diatribe of the "Lady Marmalade" singer scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when tram rider Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to get her,’” he said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
“He said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left your daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He got angry and started to use bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started to throw the water from the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle hovered over her mother -- who still held Genevieve -- and had to be held back by her surroundings and pulled into a car that was waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a supportive association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct," Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when addressing a kindergarten teacher who holds an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-described of change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of impacts by the frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were those of vegetables, vegetables and maize.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, a 6.74 increase in the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since, while from January to March 55,053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise,” he said.
Informalism
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being listed as a worker in front of any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor backs are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
IED contraction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June the state FDI totaled $ 630,697, which represents a fall of $ 87.74 percent over the same period compared to the 5 million registered.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July asked the state congress for the approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be aimed at investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 billion pesos.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 he lacked the harmonization of wills of different sectors, including the state government itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new team of government, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said events such as the early-year frosts halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing far below the expectations we had,” he said.
Re-define vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to lead the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better directs the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
“There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted narco-addict is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by members of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s box and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was made available to the District Judge and the convicted person continues internally at the Center for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
You must make contributions to the works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes effective.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
“It already happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year to be able to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending,” he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the procedures so that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
“There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they have not given us a fifth.”
Valid cut "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree advancing the so-called “analog blackout” from 2021 to 2015, by failing to gather the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concretely transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to reject the request made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
“I also consider that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belong to the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate, the rectory of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the state, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and he has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he assured.
They analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, still without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, still without counting the total votes of 6 out of 79.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As you will recall, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the present electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had omitted his publication of the argument in the planned deadlines.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and called the state president’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal,” since he has no right to “sanction or veto them.”
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the EMI it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not work in the power of the president of the same; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the second signal that the representative of the party expressed his/her request.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the supposedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that are recognizable will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday were held reconnaissances and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the Colonel’s last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the side of the other people killed in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in the Field Mars.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Colegio del Aire in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".

Three bodies found abandoned in Cadereyta farm NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the grace shot, on an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadeyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at mile 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, there was the gate open pair by pair.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow swimsuit with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strap-on swimsuit.
Just a meter away was the body of another individual in a red swimsuit and blue jeans.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth one can see legends that go from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured at 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and to whom they are related to kidnappings, murders, "hawking" and clandestine burials.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the verge of economic disaster.
Italy’s appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government facing a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders in order to regain shattered confidence in Italy.
Stressing pressure on Monti to hurry, the volatility of the markets put the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the election.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should consist only of technicians, an indication of his concerns over a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards’ rue is superior to that of the Ticos.
Of the 22 players named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 convened reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San Jose.
While the world and European champions, FIFA’s number one monthly runner-up, account for an extensive record of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain an intense activity in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated knockouts of the Euro and the World Cup.
Tico footballers, on the other hand, have limited international reach in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is of the archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona’s brain flyer, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA the previous week along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's ram, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and near Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left side Junior Diaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not close to 8 p.m.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var owns only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is on The Nation on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’re going to be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask him because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We’re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they’ve been delivering huge shows with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined that we would be in a great rock band and had it done for more than 20 years ago it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to be a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something uncommon.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange for a band like yours to stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought, without being intrigued by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first ones I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant despite being no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his (1990-2000) government, suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kg to which have been added other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the high point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be “appropriate for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations,” the South American presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has an agreement in place with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which hit stores around the world this month, has been designed from the ground up to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to wear glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how spectacleless stereoscopy should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s Spanish press chief, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support" as hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were previously adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook up less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more skilled players will be able to give a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the character's return to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting of that the plumber of the mustache will have to go through mining platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom backs Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has issued the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was due to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered the extradition.
He stated that during his tenure he "did not get his hands on" judicial decisions and processed all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s actions were an executive proceeding after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has settled his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process leading up to the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary was held yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with problems of graduation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall, and the current mayor and ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0>.
The current councilor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of the Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Eviction of an occupied farm where macro-partying took place
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 de Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the property they were illegally occupying, and where they organized macropartys that were desperate for the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited-, took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass festivities, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate were unfair competition, as they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had to respond to complaints of noise, while, as he pointed out, the inconvenience was caused not by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, by the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the
The manager of the club explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had claimed last week "to immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the occupants had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
The park or the mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Pasquines promotion of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for so many other access gates to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring issue to deal with when two members of this ancient caste of electors recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB3>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is from the ground up that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": one must not think of them "as access to a park, but the demarcation of areas where one has to act".
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
“Limiting something is setting already the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
More attentive to the question, M<0xC3><0xB3>dol thinks that, simplifying, the Valais side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical issue.
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers to his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduit that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because at the base of the contest a global vision of Collserola is missing: "16 cross-country competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in your case, that you have opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In its opinion, yes, the city should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey the pardon of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After remaining in prison for 72 days, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red grants him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the mayor's brother.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, made public a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regional city council to allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
Following the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother and on September 2 he was arrested and grounded for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecution Officer 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second warrant was issued after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes of co-examination and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was handed an arrest warrant by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was proven to determine Jonas’s guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the bookmaker’s representatives in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the regional mayor's brother; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecutor assigned to the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the file 197/2011 the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and in the following there can be no claim about the process that followed him; besides that he will not be required to repair damages or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the betting house, the immediate release of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered at around 15:50.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be filed.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results cast on the accident where the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people died, indicate that the helicopter was impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone there are no reports of the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and that this happened in an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions: -
Reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advances to the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, low-height cloud layers were presented.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions, the crew sought a lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Scattering of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of debris from the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence remains on the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was presumably disjointed along said path.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by NPI specialists
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and adolescents, called the “Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity” protocol, which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites to participate the population, whether or not they have the right, to go to the participating IMSS sports units in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests for minors are carried out, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Western Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (State of Eastern Mexico).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years old, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary disease history, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (genes associated with childhood obesity are sought to be identified) are applied to all participants.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in children.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity in the case of boys, and 47 percent in the case of girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed," the IMSS specialist noted.
He indicated that the justification for searching for the markers lies in the fact that the country’s population differs from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows detecting if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who could even reduce the number, if the process of construction and maintenance of the pavement is necessary.
In his conference A Technological Opinion of the Baches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge of developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitute the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
As vehicles pass through and efforts are generated, this allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
Over the asphalt folder, abounded, is placed a last layer called rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that is going to be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil gets wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes softening of all layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be attended to at first signals with proper maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to prevent the formation of bumps frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow you to repair the bumps with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Again the Cauca Valley remains with the desire of the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.

Today the big question that many are asking is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that won queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Literary Carriage Leamos.
To the interrogator, the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is 'The Little Prince', it's a pretty deep book.
“Crime and Punishment is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.”
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalization" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>n journalist insinuated that being the preferred, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (gastronomy challenge Oster, public vote for the best handicraft costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit appearance on Hilton Beach and his two parades on the coronation night.
Although he looked confident in both, it was noticed that he lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter on RCN’s “Como en casa” program, said Melina’s nomination as a princess “proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain as a queen.”
In addition, Valle turned out to be very evasive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
Two days before the election, the international jury, Lucy Doughty, said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens coach Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very notorious, lowered her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time presents the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel vatican appeared that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her tumultuous passage through Cartagena, was eluded by the crown.
This was the work of the cale<0xC3><0xB1>o who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lofoscopicist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a lofoscopicist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC leader: "Alfonso Cano", through the intersection of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopics who work in the CTI sectional, that week was Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> municipalities, where he often had to be interned for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear minimal clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be from the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decadactile card of William Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was the chief of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, lophoscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many criminals present false cards or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take out a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint from all over the hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Footprints can also discard or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that on the objects “the footprints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the ITC expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective match is made.
'Indignant' Defying New York Authorities
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignants" to camp again on the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the "indignant" response to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's personal eviction from his camp reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignants" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at these hours and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which provoked "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or applying “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
“The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than they are of American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “lacking respect for freedom of expression.”
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they plan to organize “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", rescuer on "Baywatch", the bunny of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 bringing to life a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears alongside his then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and which is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fool" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data between July and September was definitely a turning point: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the annualized rate.
The record in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resurgence of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with a 0.9% decline in capital expenditures from January to March, the first regression after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to reinforce – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use the shortfalls to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of economic floatation is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, lumped their weak results between July and September to the yen.
While markets continue their siege of the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not lower its guard.
“We need to be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
As it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at the level of 100, as it precipitated eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens rekindles its doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketed and uncertainty re-installed on the parquet floors, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit from the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support new austerity measures planned in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 employment-enhancing programmes, the reform of the civil servants’ disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader was a step further in his push to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still stunned by the impact caused by the order of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay for the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek knitting still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the posed in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" he noted that it lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a horizon of 2015, and, "especially, in the one whose goal is to reduce the income by half the number of people with less than
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest women", and above all for the poorest women.
There are "many achievements achieved" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform from which to push “two basic goals”.
Thus, His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families are expected to have access to these financial services and 100 million of those households are expected to exit the poverty line.
The impetus in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path begun years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the tool's father as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the nickname of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "people".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit is “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, the microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opened its doors counting".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open our way in Europe".
This could be manifested in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country's weight of the European Central Bank directive on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Seeking to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a fund responsible for family subsidies and give a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can take the cut.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of unpaid absence in the event of a layoff (to date, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also raise the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of redundancies.
"The controls are going to be significantly increased and, in addition, if someone is found committing fraud, he will have to repay the amounts," Xavier Bertrand said on RTL on Sunday.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of job cut fraud.
In fact, there has been constant monitoring of this issue since 2002 and a number of policy offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for losses accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of the expenditure on health care.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term discharges were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of losses of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, having as its starting point a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Accordingly, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent tax revenue losses of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies for losses and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos declared before Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," said the head of the government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since the country's stay in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will decrease “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He said he agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policies that prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would suffice and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is faced with such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To get started, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, that is, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons does not give their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, stated yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose deaths are near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
Moreover, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a process against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, they suggest that it should be noted in the Penal Code that withdrawal from health care, if legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in respecting the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered as euthanasia and subject to the same procedures.
Other experts make reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts who signed the report "extreme" because, among other things, the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “manifest in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry building yesterday.
Yesterday, Bashar al-Assad’s diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified, which, with Russia’s support, resists it and denounces that there is a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s relinquishment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has lamented that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country over which Turkey is taking an increasingly tougher stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime”.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died “during bombings and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "progressing towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not flinch,” he added, guaranteeing that “conspiracies plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he believes is "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect," while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, although it did not express its support for the imposition of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italia
Monti asks for time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner debated with political parties yesterday and met with trade unions and employers today.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
For his part, House Speaker Gianfranco Fini has said he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” to form a government and prepare its agenda, he stressed, adding that he is “certain that the markets will have patience and understand it.”
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but then there was concern, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial output in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government will operate until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he believes.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work with urgency and with the aim of having Italy "regain its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new rigour measures.
Italian chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place some 200 billion euros in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its “grave concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Oural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Afterwards, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in his home country's military nuclear program."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a global 14% increase in the number of anti-Liga crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“Following a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these kinds of crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said, adding that “the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s head.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more readable and live the activity of other "Twitters", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poco instintivo operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to resend a message from another persona, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation on the basis of "tweets" with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” he wrote.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter flow,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austro-Hungarian
Introduction of a Budgetary "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The large-scale Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic coalition government that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Vice Chancellor for Foreign Affairs.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government approximates the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
“We will discuss, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility” in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the record highs produced by the Japanese authorities’ intervention on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned to trading on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago, since it enriches products made in Japan and reduces the value of revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when converting them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the hardening of the yen cuts the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “economic bases.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its Treasury Letter purchases by five trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), bringing the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags flak
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges plunged slightly further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions over the yields on loans from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed outlook in Europe and trades will continue to take place in a narrow range of variations, so investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 hours, the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates rise by more than 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the intervenors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the euro area summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Looking forward to the euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favorable than the forecast 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has downgraded the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources must be alleviated to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case either for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or for Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
The Berlin election will mean an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark must be considered.
European champion in the wind sector, of which 30% of its electricity is obtained, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not in principle oppose this type of energy, as surveys show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-localizable jobs.
If France decides to abandon nuclear power, it would mean sacrificing much of those SMEs and losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of renowned professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and to cooperation between the safety authorities, and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electric players who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to including trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove to be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among countries on the positive impact of migration flows on growth and the economy.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular low-skilled workers, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and exercise mainly professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows means an increase in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just has to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as former republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a twofold revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacancy in the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows of effect, but a common exercise, full of law, calm and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is under the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, it is the one who suffers from their impotence and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without further political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
An interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with “non-contact” chip are generalized
The world chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (estimated at 580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To put the upper gear, however, it is necessary that the banks make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the payment medium of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're praying."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers "already has certainty."
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show they are cooperating,” he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis terrorists
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially caught the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we should certainly wait to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support from abroad and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and styled kamikazes or explosive devices used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an illuminated community of little interest.
A Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for Sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is sentenced to death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacks Abuya, in particular the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think it is.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more noisy statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans are spread about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “diffuses” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing with his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capability,” seemingly ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty exit of the “boys” from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
Attacks are not easy for them.
The population is rather positive about Obama’s national security balance, which ended with bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is distrustful of military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the inflow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km tidal tidal that connects the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 that will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube for the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work is in the air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow the supply of gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land passage by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon said at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating how big contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted over its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project managers renounced it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned company to establish itself permanently at sea off its coasts.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted junctions that are forecast to have one leak every 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a vessel, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a puree, it enters the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without any repairs needed.
The circulation of the gas is ensured simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to Gazprom, for a renewable period of 25 years, the entire gas transport capacity.
“Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident they won’t outperform their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back their taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch on the market a notebook of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s consultant, was in charge of launching the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to reach a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has remained far away.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at the beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city center, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the "Detour" exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Desensitizing?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
“The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It should be noted that disabled unemployed people continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the quid of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for la Cité noted that the directors surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabilities," with "excessive representation of wheelchair users, physical or intellectual disabilities."
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We now reach around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forward’s gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," says the Lille forward.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
“I’m in Lille all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, given this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Don’t forget about “pleasure”.
He has been encouraging the Blues since he was seven, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
Certainly, that will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"Pride" also to check, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal has a lot of confidence
Portugal's Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the game back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes are over, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Sele<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which has been running since September 2010, is going to qualify for the Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the 0-0 away game, on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home.”
But at home, in the luminous Estadio de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the party "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home," says Bento.
“We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think".
It’s a good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time.
