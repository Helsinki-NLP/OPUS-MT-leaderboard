Victory of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the people who called these early elections.
As early as July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government shipwreck.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that as early as Monday this could be reached at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the election results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated from 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then the BZO was a unit in 2005).
Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is already taking over his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to get to parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles cannot be solved, Czech-India relations could cool down, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then yes, this cooling would surely be achieved," he said after the meeting, which was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get in.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest courts.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," the Czech Foreign Minister said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already being obtained by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he insisted before his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists to be of great importance.
“We really consider it a trembling mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister circumvented the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbiters a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by sea.
It is not interested, however, in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides until today a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm ground
The countries with coastlines have today begun to fiercely contest the new territories under the sea.
Under the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Shelf.
“Continental Edge” means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the underwater continent.
It reaches to the limit of the sea coast, and often to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continental Shelf must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance commission.
To date, the Commission has processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed surface granted to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in their studies.
The gain that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Treaty of Montego Bay".
Where the continental edge ends begins the ocean floor region declared by the Treaty as "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not any gold mine," says director Mikulka emphatically adding "that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract."
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the capability to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the command of the German special forces was in the place of action.
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus in the place of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany’s help to use it as support on the spot.
“Fortunately that moment did not come,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the auspices of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first U.S. House of Congress failed a massive $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package with 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program that should limit the disorder in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the $700 billion grand package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked MPs to vote even though the plan is not as popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Already during the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for that was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the program requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report an increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tour organisers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the next few months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened juncture the Germans’ desire to travel remains as before.
As reported on Monday by Germany’s travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened dollar course, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The Germans’ preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better computable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the sales volume compared to last year went up again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, beer in one-liter jars and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom Bavarian traditional suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in the tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with photos - it is very flattering especially because I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seem to matter or feel unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A nun draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm hanging from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
The others don’t care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it’s written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their nude ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and he is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after putting his glass of a litre of beer next to him that he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that's a dumpster.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and can not consume so much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, sanitation groups run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitary facilities appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walkways from one tent to another.
That works as with most visitors: they come sober, they come back drunk.
It is not known who suffers from alcoholemia and is on the walks.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ a health care provider answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Its Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers had a desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inland Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to clock the end of the platforms and has in front of two towers, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted door has been overcome, there is no doubt about the company’s greatness that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a "late eater" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munitions train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then, the station has been falling apart and left out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has raised some suspicions in the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure – built ad hoc – in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-sized shopping malls and “power bakeries” where middle-class managers in business suits – men and women – gather early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look both east and west at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
“Turkey,” he replies, “doesn’t want to insult that choice.”
Then he underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had recited to me almost from memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha Station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East would, in large part, be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So there is not much doubt as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (scene, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sung its finale in 1979, several of us were ending our 20s – we just refused to give it up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form-changing being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxable, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical escarding, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by none, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world.”
We'll miss you so much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) he states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research grant... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a Woodruff author’s note on Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention for their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
To all this, refined mechanics are added, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
It is precisely in Japan that about one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
For the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely curb the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders expect the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a 16% decrease.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Also, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once it is made in partnership in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also increases.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the version with the 1.4 engine, as the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will feature two 1.2 and 1.4-liter gasoline engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter mechanics achieves a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which in the past Jazz reached 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous propulsion, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now goes to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s composite eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to make the small robot avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about memory giga’s, not even mega’s.”
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation satellite system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Tremble Before Borrowing
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages at banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or of Trouble.
The tetrical aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but not very detailed.
It’s more of a teenage page than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because of buying a better house we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news story that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after discovering a provisional settlement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28 per cent above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley’s stock, however, lost 6.79% at $23.77 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The terms presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive, explained in Tokyo, “we thought the participation would have consisted only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50 % above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, refused to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan needed to have greatly relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market price fall by half while the cost of collateral against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other only “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimating it between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly ", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution entails an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially on the basis of oil extraction by foreign companies and on the basis of currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can make up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and would seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped in the desert ten days ago arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical tests, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an all-terrain safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one zulu to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
“An exchange of shots occurred, and half of the hijackers were killed, the others have fled,” said this official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blitz" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
“We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, the special forces,” he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an off-road vehicle with the hijackers on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader and arresting two.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Lyrics - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
It's better that way.
But one aspect of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the wretched sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with looking into history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s head of economic competition.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis of the euro area in the context of the international financial crisis that is occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedent.
According to the decision taken in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3> in the Netherlands.
Fortis shares started a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
Shares of the company fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the North American market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had already assured investors that they had nothing to worry about, they are not going to lose their money.
There has been no panic among Bank customers so far, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see data from the drug purchase.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the recipes in all cases joins it to the approval of the given person.
The same should be in independent hands, because if not, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the prescription follow-up program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
They sent the client for medical check-up and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client’s diseases and health status.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are minor difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-use, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for their negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently developed the results of laboratory tests and by linking them with drug consumption data they obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
Already before Congress is the bill that gives the right to the authority for the control of companies specialized in the provision of personal data.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, despite everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trading partners, this issue in addition to the other largely global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, Chief Representative of Foreign Policy, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, that is to increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
In this way, the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonized, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and greenhouse gas production should be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.

A meeting with the print in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse will follow: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of the publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing millionaire a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett’s plane have been found, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the Mammoth Lakes Nevada Sierra area, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County commissioner John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it is the very thing that Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance.”
The commissioner said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire was killed in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) has reported that a team of investigators has been dispatched a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, which has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world’s turn in an aerostatic balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world tour by plane and without a stopover.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv off-the-shelf with an original and well-established design with defined lines and defined angles.
This, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to the out-of-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompanied the launch of the Glk SUV, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will it be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The removal of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the militants’ hometown appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, making them easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what had gone out for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorder.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those from all over Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand in a stadium anymore.
Thankfully!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty others may be added.
"We need to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the interior ministry said.
That's why, "eyes open" especially in view of Wednesday's National game in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is, the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was formerly of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste’s public safety where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics that has been shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - adds the n.1 of the Observatory - the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact occurs.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let us also speak of the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if they allow they are also not of education.
