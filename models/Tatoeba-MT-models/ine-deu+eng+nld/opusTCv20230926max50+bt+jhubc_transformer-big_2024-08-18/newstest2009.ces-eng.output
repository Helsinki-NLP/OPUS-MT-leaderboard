The Prague Stock Exchange collapsed to a minus at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been following its downturn on Monday since the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, there is a decline in Wall Street shares.
This is also reflected in the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of stock in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock markets in Asia, although the indexes eventually cleared some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong dropped nearly four percent during trading, but later cut some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market fell by 3.6 per cent, according to the index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
There is also a risk that other countries will feel the impact.
The Bloody Bath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was expected to cost up to $700 billion (nearly CZK 12 trillion).
Legislators ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw the biggest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent, with a similar decline last seen in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but once it turned out that the bill had not passed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress Resigns: U.S. Government May Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The top U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be held early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen have to complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, the plan could be voted on in the Senate on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there will be a sobriety due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which markets can be helped to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on what the market stabilization package should look like," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund a definitive shape.
It should buy back non-sellable mortgage assets from financial companies that drag financial companies into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect trading on Monday.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can fix the last-minute negotiations on a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still subject to a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is not fulfilling its function, followed by another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
The President may veto this decision, but Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funding to buy bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, has remained.
"We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said legislators had agreed on responsibilities for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding reliefs, timing funding the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee that will supervise the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who are having repayment problems.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of installments for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Mark, chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“And that’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought back.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now, or early next week, is not so significant, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that this week Congressmen agree that they support this plan and that they dedicate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement for approval to take place is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Combat on knife blades: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for a person to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a top-of-the-line expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products on LPs do not come from a qualitative point of view and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues in your racks, you probably at least dream of such a turntable.
It is the same with music on the road, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a fan of Pink Floyd probably has a hard time tasting headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some top-notch music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles don’t even happen to do.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephoning and sesemescing, he can play music and video, both record, has a better, worse camera and maybe he can even navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill, and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest hurdles of energy.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, you should be aware that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and moreover, not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except iPods.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or even the user's rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones are more capable
When choosing a specific device, you should be particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, control comfort.
If music is your backdrop and you listen to it every day for a short time, for example in a tram, you need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
That’s what almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to watch much of what music formats the phone or player can do.
MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you have to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) via mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service in itself could already be a valid argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and is usually limited to fast-drying radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will be dominated by the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their mobiles with them.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you grab your phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music mobiles will be for many price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
However, most of the time you will be limited to the absence of an output on a regular headphone.
The best and technically the most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm port for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the control with a previously common cassette player or, for example, a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet and subsequently a huge account for data transfer.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you can fit in two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach out to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you’re a more demanding listener, go for specialized mobiles – walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and thus the comfort of the operator is closer to a separate MP3 player.
Next up is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price range up to 4,000 CZK, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classics to discount.
Maybe he won't be long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
Moreover, the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, this may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic stay so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and penetration is over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to bet that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classical operator with its own network no longer seems to have too many chances (by the way, it would probably be difficult to search for frequencies).
But there is one more option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, to which then the classical operators had to react.
Even before the introduction of sticks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices sounded in the UK as in our country.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not carry with them relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on an unscrambled target group.
This operator is specifically aimed at men.
“Administrative guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, running this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be grasped in our country.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem too hopeful.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competitors arise.
GTS Novera Group has not been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe he's looking for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no entity has addressed us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 press department told Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds, in rare agreement with the O2 statement: “We have not yet seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build on.”
He added: “T-Mobil’s network is unlikely to have a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we would already have to have a specific agreement on the table in order to be able to consider it in this short term."
Vodafone is paying more attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter?
The fact that when the operators are concerned about something, they can pull a single rope, is also evidenced by the pulling around the creation of the U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> went at the time of the creation of the U:fon from the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
Due to this approach of mobile operators, however, there is a complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just a position of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other developed countries, has no power to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract has been concluded between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
The statements made in this way by the representatives of the operators are probably not surprising.
It is more than a matter of concern to an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
Especially, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are commonly operating, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
Obviously, however, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is not in the interests of the EAGGF.
In truth, shocking to the whole case is the touching coherence of the three mobile operators that results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is offered entirely by itself.
Like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations, it’s certainly just a matter of chance and tough competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have adequate increased responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also available to the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are the single market from a competitive point of view.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not admit this argument, it should be at least a warning for the EEAS that three mobile operators are proceeding noticeably similarly.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all operators.
Responsibilities at the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS hands away from the whole matter.
We have met with him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act with the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s powers to the field of competition in telecommunications, many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This needs to be known more than well by the representatives of the EPA, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's watching
However, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone price lists, but they are only partially public.
It is usually a multi-level marketing company.
Our own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many more.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If there are any cases you are talking about, they could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we are dealing with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered our question on this issue.
It is, however, unlikely that such an activity would not have occurred to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are opposed to such a procedure.
These companies have significant profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not in any way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not kept in their name, so they cannot make full use of it as regular customers of mobile operators.
But that’s what should be weird at least.
In addition, another question opens for the EPA.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the EAGGF has a fairly strong authority to detect such an activity and, if it does not want to, is not satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea of anything and their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
In virtually all the countries where virtual operators were created, the classical operators tried to more or less defend their creation.
The arguments used by Jimi were virtually identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this time that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and another was packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators turn the whole case around like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the ambiguity in competences is more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really soon appears, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain incapable of rejecting (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the shots than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day, presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mj<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The hymn was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vk.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral presentation and instrumental version.
The song was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices, who are prominent and popular, to sing solo versions.
"From the beginning, I was with both of them, and then I also tried to make sure that the choir had a clear dictation so that the text was well understood, so that they could resonate," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where my home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovsk<0xC3><0xBD> Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ek by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl supplemented by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for theirs.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first song became a natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound
Prague’s public transport system will also take you to the chip for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will enter the metro, tram and buses.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the information centers and workstations of the Transport Company in the subway stations Museum, Bridge, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Koby zalys.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers used the service in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the exit windows at the subway stations, where they had to regularly stand in long lines on paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet and upload it to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers are provided with a desk with trained service, which will help the interested parties with their online purchase and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic vouchers to Opencard in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, resemble ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztylya, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are five of them in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," he added.
The coupon checks the driver's seat vending machine
The operation of the machines that will start operating tomorrow is simple.
Simply insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it yourself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which drive to the capital mainly inhabitants of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, with which they determine the time and band validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drapal from the organization Ropid, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's cash register.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and do not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the self-service vending machines where vouchers are loaded onto the card.
Here they will be shown information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Sudetenland wanted a referendum on the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans called for the integration of the Forest into the United States.
This comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This results, among other things, from a letter that was preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the US president not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure that American troops are coming to German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads.
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - only hope for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that he take over the protectorate for the present and future <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
"We can't believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would have given this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and repels minorities and nothing at all contributes to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly fear of the vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president is said to have doubts about the minds of the Germans in Shumaava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in Shumaava County on whether its people want to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some memorabilia it appropriately outlines the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to have at least guessed that this would be their expulsion from the republic, only a few of them admitted to such an option at all.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the wars, he was a Budweiser German assigned to the Baltic navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a detention camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, Czech would be useful to them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver.
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Still, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to deter the driver from dangerous driving behaviour.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should deter the driver from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to tie them up before they leave.
It wants to reach the conscience of especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least also professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mostly human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on a letterhead.
And then there's the word "you'll pay" in the blood pool.
This is meant to symbolize that one can pay for one’s own life in a moment of inattention.
Viewers will be "frightened" by 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip to the driver
"The system of sugar and whips applies to the driver.
Sugar for them is that if they go for red, for example, it will save time.
A whip is a threat of punishment or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
The signs are already less effective, according to him, which alert the driver to danger.
"If a static hazard warning board is installed, it is likely to merge with the surrounding area soon and drivers will not devote themselves to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories will have to be returned," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over a similar percentage to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city that killed several people and killed dozens of people.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" that lie inside the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan,” he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shiite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to terrorism (the Shiite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaida and the jihadi uprisings (the holy ones).
Question after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is not known, walking in a long-distance bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers the coffee or newspaper.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical license.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Distance buses Student Agency have no place for parking; this was confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"We dealt with this with the Ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
“They later called it off and we have come to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their own seat,” he said.
The Law of the Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of the driver of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Director of the Department of Traffic of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes that the law deals with the issue adequately.
"It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces allowed in the type approval.
That's the end," he says.
Buses divide into urban, where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speed, inter-urban with parking spaces with higher permitted speed and remote without parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
It’s like on a plane, says an expert.
BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n sees no major problem in the movement of the flight attendants on board the bus.
"With smooth driving, there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service in planes.
Nor is it certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head."
“But if the bus brakes hard, of course the physical laws apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations," he says, and also believes that the issue is unresolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of flight attendants as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon arrival.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
It has become an immense tragedy
A young flight attendant from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in a plane crash to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the lane without the use of a router and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he was stunned by the right front.
That two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the courtroom, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
In the Invisible
The clarification of the movement of the stewards on board the bus could bring an amendment of the law, which over a year works a thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
“But she didn’t come to any concrete conclusions.
Buses do not solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during driving," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka's spokesman concludes, noting that the control of the safety of buses is in the hands of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
Great words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central institution of the financial group of savers for trading in capital markets," the letter, which was received by the public on Monday, reads.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter into this transaction a “competence set” ensuring long-term returns.
And in general, it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impetus for further associations in the sector of land-based banks.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose announcement to the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which saver customers are aware of for its investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the half-yearly results of the economy at the end of August, Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas made it clear that the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße bank house with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, made no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which consists of one half of the Land Bank and the other half of the Savings Bank, has entrusted the Board of Directors with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be a trade in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers said.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not being talked about for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that there could be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
In the end, there was nothing of this trinity.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other two banks have been linked.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Still, there has been repeated speculation about the connection of Deka-Bank with the land-based banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke negatively about speculation about the merger of his financial home with others.
However, it seems that, regardless of this, it has the conviction that the convergence of the different banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, the connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be drawn first.
That's not exactly good news for Helabu.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, the potential partners for such mergers are gradually lost.
In the south, she would only play the second violin, despite the fact that she has so far faced the financial crisis much better than the bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Association of Hesse-Thüringen Savings Banks and Jurassic Banks, which has a 58% stake in Helab, again banned the connection with WestLB.
That would be the case for Nord LB at most.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much harmonizes the business models of individual institutions.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of land-based banks, the German Union of Savings Banks and Giro Banks has not yet been answered.
It could all end up with WestLB, which of course no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter of the board of directors there also speaks of the fact that they are trying to provide a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components to the Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, the third or the fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be like his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can give out his throat.
Elena licks Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart this evening at 23.45 with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with only Brazilians on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
The three buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with a fur-like lining and glasses with wide silver rims.
He has been with them for five years at the Oktoberfest, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome beer toast with Kaiser, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian beer purity law, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
The buses leave at night, along the motorway towards "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus is quiet, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it makes another stop on the motorway number 8 just before Munich and many other buses with an Italian badge.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, about 50 more buses from all over Europe are already standing there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" cried Marco in the morning air.
"Go!" Go and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to obstruct, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out in space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the spills.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving decently.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Be here again at exactly half past eleven tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a place with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as signs on trees, signs and even on the election poster of one big Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
The "weekend with Italy" is known as the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
The exact number of visitors is not available; there are about fifty thousand who go on a trip through the Alps and enter beer tents, ten percent of all visitors came from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force will reinforce seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics, in which Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) occupy the first place with about 200 medical treatments.
Particularly popular with Italians is the Hofbräu tent.
Sleepless nights for lenders Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word “relatively” and has also implicated in its claim that the German banking sector will not be spared from crisis developments.
Because that one happened last weekend.
The Dax-monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance would go up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from the amount actually spent.
The money is said to come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier refinanced himself for long-term projects on which he had borrowed money in an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible due to a lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve decreased by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and its share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Regular income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, income from increased receivables and from certain securities, as well as from the cancellation of credit trading reserves, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
It was only due to higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and from the intermediation of trade for group companies that the 16 % decrease in revenues was still moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on commercial mortgages, which were then taken out of the service portfolio and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Because of the low earnings of traditional state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private-public-partnership (PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write something off, and these write-offs will have a “fundamental material effect” on calculating the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been uncertain.
The fact is that there will be no dividend.
For 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depf, Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects.
Stronger than other institutions, they depend on refinancing in the interbank market because it does not have any customer deposits.
After the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of Depf's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapable of functioning”.
Other sources have suggested that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take advantage of the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and intractable nature of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appears to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the bailout cannot, even if provisional, calm the passion.
The share price fell 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
On the contrary, the bond rates were well maintained.
While preferential debt has practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This mainly concerns bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less-disabled commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares to hope for now - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, the likelihood of bordering on certainty has now become merely legitimate hope.
This, especially for long-term creditors, will probably prepare a number of waking nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the margin line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the exchange rate yields of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the Secret of Bento Boxes
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to introduce herself to her first day at high school in Taciban, the girls begin to sneer: that German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga. In her new blog about the exchange stay she talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I travel 40 minutes by train to high school in Tachiban.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Taciban is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine o'clock a short session with a teacher begins, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform, I wore my host mother’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue underpants, and black leather shoes.
So, dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nar Wo and Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and in a week I have a birthday.
At that point, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whistling, chirping and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I know that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly stepped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong came back, I was literally stuffed.
They talked over each other and chirped and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the end of the break, everyone packed up their benches.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, lettuce from cucumbers and algae, fruit and some fish in a tofu pastry.
I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste a whole new thing.
I'm sure it's all really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that he gives the girl a self-made bento to the boy, which in this case is especially artistically arranged, and hopes that he will get to know the boy at a snack for a break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause I'm just fascinated.'
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning a little bit of Japanese one day.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And you're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings.
When rats or cockroaches run away from danger, does this mean that they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave the same way as we do?
For several years, contributions from well-known scientists have been published in the online magazine "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, when we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to engage with a different species and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the inaccessible terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the rat gets into danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, fleeing, or attacking.
Humans behave in a similar way, which some scientists deduce to comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share of short-term memory and executive or managerial functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be the language essence of a person: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if language consciousness did not matter, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, due to special hardware, to analyze it on the basis of our own experience, its exploration puts us before great problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides that, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was pursued by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nonfrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activities.
What we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) makes use of operational memory.
Seen from this angle, feelings are closely related to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states so that we can attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to physical sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the sensations perceived by multiple animal races.
In theory, I can’t argue with that, but I think it’s unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans probably feels the same to both organisms: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep says, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, not even the brain of a cockroach.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I’d rather study emotional behavior than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and in humans.
As with rats, I don’t examine language and consciousness, I don’t even examine feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline from grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early completion of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts hesitate.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work now as quickly as possible," said Grigory Surkis, the president of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step has been agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by an independent administrator, Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewieck<0xC3><0xBD>.
There is a “serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not hurt preparations for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced descent only last season due to manipulations, eventually even the start of the league had to be moved quickly.
Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise the new film, talked about private things in an interview — and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's pissed and he's kicking back.
A delayed war of roses with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors have a nasty argument in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, spoke for the first time about the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental stripping was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - which tells the story of a twisted marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: It's "crazy," the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly revamps the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
In addition, it is "politely worthy" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thoughts on avoidance as follows: “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m happy to have an amazing family that’s doing great.”
The prices of flights and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have fallen again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter, it found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising hotel prices, accommodation in many places has already declined.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers the weak dollar exchange rate to be the reason for this trend, which has caused “the declining appetite of American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 percent and even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed a further upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the price of kerosene, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights were up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of Economy class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in the Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9 per cent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
On the German domestic flights, according to the study cited, prices fell even by half.
One of the reasons for this price decline is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable airlines and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single bar and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay still fails to build a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got involved in the game late and did not succeed with a sticky balloon.
His message was precisely worded and sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
'We need a second goal, 'said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
Not much was done in the catacombs, the break between the half-times was over, and most of the people sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys greater respect than many momentary actors.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant pulled in and raised his thumb to mark the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
The execution did not take place.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to be more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the header of Mladen Petric (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbasans could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as a premium.
It'll be a birthday without a party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and from FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but still can not shine.
"We need more emotion and more dribbling," Jol said firmly.
After the defeat in the vote
There is a lot of fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the rescue package sinking caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow added something.
Around 20.30 this most important world stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was in Dow at the time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs has lost nearly 10 percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett, a large investor, had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds should be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive stock options of financial companies, which could be repaid if the exchange rate develops favorably, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not relieve investors of doubt.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly declining and the Dax index is falling with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular exchange rate losses from Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank plunged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of their value despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and, with a minus of 3.7 percent, recorded 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street trade day began with significant losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout may not be enough to revitalize financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the rescue plan, with the Senate due to speak on October 1.
The other European exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 per cent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, Japan’s top Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In the MDAX, they lost after the announcement of the increase in the underlying assets of the share of Arcandor.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism group has announced that it will not sell the shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
The fault of the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threatens her death from the cold.
Among scientists, one mysterious phenomenon has been confusing for years - the anomaly of the gravitational pull.
The gravitational pull is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect according to the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomaly of the gravitational pull.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curving space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and is trying to explain the anomaly of gravitational waves by means of so-called dark matter, the presence of which in space has been detected by astronomers.
"This anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about ten years.
The gravitational force is evident from it, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, even visible light.
Scientists estimate that one-fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of this dark matter.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian foreign minister said that tourists were once again kidnapped in Egypt.
Kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in the shooting before being released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Talks about the ransom are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists dragged into the Sahara seem to be free.
Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media reported the same.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and also their eight Egyptian guides are in order and safe.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shooting remains unclear before the release of the hostages: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the quoted worker said.
It is said that "it was just about the hostages taking over" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six hijackers in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, capturing two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million ransom from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German mediators, said the release of the hostages was being extended because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo has refused to comment on the report.
Abuses by the Fathers "leaded to suicide"
Several years of abuse by the stepfather led to the woman’s murder, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also said that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound her and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was reported in court that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the ghost of abuse committed twice a week on her.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006, Ms. Randle’s friends, who also spent a lot of time surfing and cycling, said she was “emotionally dead” and “gave up her life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she suffocated with a bag of needles.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This nasty story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more frightening is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, the case would probably not have been brought to court at all.”
"I would particularly like to stress the consequences, according to Stephanie's parents, of your crime on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously, she would probably be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police officer be prosecuted on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained al-Qaida’s secret analysis and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Social Reserves Face Debt B&B
British cooperative back-ups may have to deal with more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers at Bradford & Bingley with <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Association of Cooperative Reserves (BSA), said it was "degrading" that reserves and their members must pay.
The 14-billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime will be paid back each year by all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 co-operative foundations are included in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which behaved prudently... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the reserves of this should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
That means the reserves will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the trade association of cooperative foundations, told the BBC that he believes this is not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the boom of the housing market must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent.”
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect cooperative backups and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest payable in 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be repaid for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative back-ups are shareholder-free organizations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is already the second price increase this year, after the two-fifth price increase in February, and comes after research conducted by the consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price increase in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladeshi ex-premier's bail denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajida to release her on bail, meaning that if she returns to her homeland, she can be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court had refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she had received more than fifty million dollars ($729,700) from a certain businessman by blackmail when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalida Zij<0xC3><0xA1>, longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole in order to undergo a medical procedure abroad, under the conditions of her release, it is not clear if she will remain at large until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she is now appealing against the Supreme Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request, saying that he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an investigation released abroad to make an honest statement," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are appealing against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to be able to return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December election.
The High Representative of the People’s League said Sheikh Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held Provisional Government seized power, but was released from prison in June to be allowed abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasin and Khalid Zija both reject all the charges brought against each other.
Fears of measles vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against measles because of violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said that despite the Taliban's promises that thousands of vaccine workers would not be attacked or prevented from working.
BSkyB loses court case over ITV
BSkyB lost the litigation over the review of the Competition Commission’s decision, which ordered it to reduce its share of ITV’s competitive broadcasting.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % to below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share was aggravated by the competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in the 2006 deal, which as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fairtrade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organization and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. attorneys’ case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers, and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to foil justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: “Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their duties in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been released due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissals of lawyers were rated no worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys investigate and pursue lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire for his dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he was "mainly responsible" for the dismissal, "resigned" from his leadership position, and "remarkably not involved" in the event.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The nomination for this year is led by the group Coldplay, which has been narrowly selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: “There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf’s album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the chart for about nine years and has sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name of Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated on due to an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later, it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other dirt roads, some famous, others only useful.
But even many taxi drivers-veterans and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This tiny street is in the East Village neighborhood and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic move.
There are no signs with street names.
It is virtually invisible in the atlas.
However, it has an admirer's street.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants Extra Place to re-paint and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the shortened alley just because it was one of the last remains from before the block was upgraded.
However, the Urban Protection and Development Authority, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal land committee, representatives of the city government and Avalon Bay company outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant, when the street will remain in the hands of the city, and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"Proposals for repair and administration could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to repaint a small street and set up seats, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Preservation of Buildings, said the city really wanted to sell the street, and said his office's job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne’s large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the backdrop of a photograph on the packaging of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“That place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of waste, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the upgrading of the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, albeit modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "Book of Crying: A Bitterly Nostalgic View of the City in the Extinction Process"), hung out part of the story of Extra Place from the rubric "Let's Talk About the City," which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the daytime, and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and rammed windows, where a week-old newspaper roams the streets."
With a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the doorway that once led to the CBGB, where today stands the store of expensive clothing.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers, there was an empty bottle of beer.
A few passers-by said he rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that he might use some kind of perseverance.
Conversely, Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the street’s impressiveness in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, damp, and ugly places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this edition of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of “Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is a daunting matter.
Barack Obama’s educational agenda only proves it.
Obama’s campaign notes that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to study than white students,” which is true.
To combat such performance disparities, Obama’s education agenda especially promotes, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is no stronger than his interest in reducing performance disparities.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in Los Angeles East.
Students of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Yet in the 2008 state tests of mathematics, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade pupils got to the highest level.
Nearly as astoundingly, ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and access without excuses.
Further, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach to those who are just learning English is “complete immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know what it was."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school as a Sixth Street Prep as a model, what should other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English-taught pupils look like?
The results that the school achieves should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase the performance gaps, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule them and trivialize them.
Oil declines sharply due to renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. plan to save the financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Futures oil prices fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and also by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, rebounding in a wave of huge financial market uncertainty.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the U.S. Congressional Presidium announced it had reached an agreement this weekend on the largest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing meltdown, the government announced that the Citigroup Group will acquire a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the furious weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy "prove to be incapable of reviving the market mood."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“Prospects for global equity, interest rates and foreign exchange markets have been severely shattered,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus is spreading around the world, and especially to China.”
Analysts at this bank have cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have cut their gasoline price forecasts for 2009 by about 20 percent.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey over the past eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned pointless play into a spanish ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds above them with their afflicted play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing an afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before halftime.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre told Coles about all his plays.
“He’s a damn good player.
We communicated very well, no matter what people thought.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray shot and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another replay and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal off the field, earning the lead 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
The Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
The rested Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he rolled over his previous time of 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly unbelievably wide - surpassing the world record or at least being a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he feared — perhaps too scared in retrospect — that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish line - he won the Gebreselassia on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on the longer track, the marathon record in the last decade has fallen by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a seizure in his calf two weeks ago and skipped a week of training.
The break apparently aroused him rather than delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He has also been criticized — mainly in Kenya, East Africa’s rival Ethiopia — for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world’s top marathons, relying on conductors as if it were a race on the track, and building world records over a sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors disbanded, two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi were constantly chasing Gebreselassie.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal, Gebreselassie last took and ran away to Kwambai, who then finished in second place at 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race she finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkova, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
A record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Sixty-six-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nek surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
She skipped the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes in the third marathon she ever ran.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape in a big lead and then she reached them after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the scenic amusement parks of greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and demandingness of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred squats, three hundred squats, three hundred good swimmers."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Eatonville Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a no-go, though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tour guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in the year that the Black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate about races, many locals remain wary of the views of strangers.
“We’re paying close attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city’s oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Black rise and a community of almost 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also of oaks, a shadowy example of the southern rural Black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And concerns about Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of idioms such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide turned the city a short distance into Highway 17, which leads through the often-passed center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the blast of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the shop of First Eatonville Mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the roadside," she wrote, "is a white, brown-decorated, modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow of Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in an hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
“She said it the way it was,” says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipping eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she came to the city, she arrived without notice in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is still proud of its dignified dress.
Most of the people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many scoffed.
"The people of Zora have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, hovering on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or major public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood her importance to the world or her legacy at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
Change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Representatives of Orange County wanted to extend the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
Orlando's cruising has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city's western outskirts.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the fifties of the 20th century, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
“At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people who sat on the side,” Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady who killed it.
They got out of the melon car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown v. Chamber of Education case to be "offensive to my race rather than celebratory."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, have helped to create space for many more of Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists like her who have risen above prejudices with light-hearted self-esteem and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the delight of my presence!
I don't understand that."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston's highly acclaimed biography by Robert E. Hemenway re-entered the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
Her former neighbors, the Hurstons, now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to their highway to destroy, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway project.
"The five currents of the highway have resurrected, you would say, a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it simpler: "Tomorrow saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the re-asphalted and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a cobbled alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance, and certain things — like wall paintings in the oldest Eatonville church painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, self-confident teacher who loves the rich red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, not better, not worse, and equally proud, creative, hard-working, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, echoes his sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police, which he says would use some help.
And even younger ones, like the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexie Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon told the church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a look at history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak financially fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and the huge television screens on Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glazed bee hive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still whistling metal trolleys on the sidewalks and transfer muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics still move between the turrets and wear, like human mules, fifty iron-clad shirts that hang from the scales on their backs.
The office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t seem like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task to cover up with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in line.
Not in front of checkouts to pick up or store cash, but in front of a counter where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to shop for Macy’s mixed goods, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason as I did.
But compared to me, they have already taken their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They picked up money from so-called thrifts (a bit like construction savings banks), money unions, and from the types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and who claim to care for their customers as if they were a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been quietly bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The staff of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially in the last week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bank that went bankrupt, and to her exterminated executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity, as if she were teasing a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old housewife of my co-worker, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my food deliveries.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing crackdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian Right Party of the Free, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Party of Vlaams Belang, participate in the demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They bear signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge profits in the general election.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linze were sometimes between Friday evening and this morning severely damaged and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some of the tombs, such as the Star of David, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was in any way linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration that comes as the Muslim fast month of Ramadan draws to a close.
In the meantime, Austria is entering the circle of seeking its own soul after the right wing crashed in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won more than 18 percent of the vote, protested against scarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that have a perceived relationship with Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European fraternity” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right on the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamour star who was convicted of child sexual abuse, has been barred from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials have imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that it plans to travel via France to Spain.
The travel ban was approved by Kent police last Thursday after they handed over evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, by his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend a hearing at the Ashford Lower Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kent police requested a decree that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter has informed authorities that he wants to travel abroad, according to a sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A spokeswoman for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
In our view, it is easier to watch someone stay in the UK because we have extensive systems here that manage the potential dangers more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent Police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual offenders to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass the passport check and eventually he flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Lowest Criminal Court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and pleased that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off-stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no phone calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, detached from the focus on interpretation - this is the only way to achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other hand, a man.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a lethally captured look or the passionate gesticulation of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to get on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer composes a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca program, "reflects the ever-growing international significance of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but if you look at the photographs, you'll find that um is not a typical image.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and completely captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take photos on stage.
It has its own personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it a contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, flamenco mirrors: "Music with very traditional roots, but it does not cease to surprise and develop."
What draws the audience is not the action of the dance, the song or the game itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is a constant of work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotomata.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists form famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in a book containing portraits.
The passion for portraiture brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea on the "Portraits of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject") two years ago.
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "picturing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or shorter, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he sometimes doesn’t even know, or they give him just a few minutes to take pictures.
In spite of similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the Gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is "courage"
Set in an environment he doesn’t yet know and tells of events unknown to him, Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project – he’s just working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and traveled to Amazon.
The eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him "is boldness" and that "everything indicates that I should not write" this novel.
“If I had reason, I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it and I believe I’ll finish it one day,” he concluded his post at the idea, thought, and word exchange festival, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct over four days by hundreds of writers, historians, and journalists, and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for Most Popular Writer - Dickens's old edition of "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romem, who introduced him, he had a well-received audience in front of him, and he was "inspired" by the <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, to whom an hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with astonishing accuracy and a notable dose of humor remembered how in him from the original "incredible literary adventure" to the "pleasure of the passionate reader" and the <0xC5><0xA0>t.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to determine whether and to what extent "books can change lives," but "I refuse to believe that literature is mere fun, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized that according to him, "it is impossible to "exercise" and "exercise on people" and "exercise on them"
Due to climatology, the festival in Pozoblanco is lost - the spears are missing
The performance with the spears, which closes the celebration in Pozoblanco, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement was confirmed by the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, together with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to cancel bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions afflict this festival for a long time, two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second scheduled bullfights.
During them, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were supposed to stand up to bulls in the arena at Castilblanco.
This is how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was rewarded with a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spears for greetings and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than the art of Toreador.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the bull arena of Los Llanos unsalted fatless.
In the second round of hard work, without a single breath, he received sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They took control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza road control in the urban district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Officers stop two people in the van, and they run away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government’s Interior Affairs Committee, members of the group were persecuted and detained by one of the truck drivers, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out roadside checks on the N-1 at the places where it crosses the border of the city district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were going to stop the delivery for inspection, but the driver did not obey the instructions, accelerated sharply and ran away.
The officers immediately started chasing the car, when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped and fled to the wooded grove.
Ertzaintza officials eventually tracked down one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during an inspection of the delivery of the Iveco Daily brand.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packets of hashish, which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "mistaken" and did not agree with the data indicated in the delivery documents, and the detainee was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues his search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was transferred to the police department to handle appropriate formalities before proceeding to further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a California Highway Patrol spokesman told People magazine.
At around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "suddenly stepped on the gas, drove back and forth in noisy thunder, and tried to get out of the parking lot - she crossed her sunglasses several times while backing up."
The witness, who apparently did not know the actress at first, saw Locklear's moment after stopping at a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When police arrived at the scene, they found an actress inside the vehicle, which partly blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," so members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were suddenly ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was apparent to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a more closely unspecified substance, and around 7:00 p.m. she was taken into custody, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a medical clinic, where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and a member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, announced today that the final decision in the case of the former councillor of youth and sport of the city of Seville Francisca Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after he was accused of joining the party in favor of his family.
"I'm too much of a federalist, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares hinted at a move the party will have to step up to in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
The head of the IU insisted, however, that in the case of an investigation into an illegal act committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
'Sangre de mayo', Garci's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de Mayo", inspired by the episodes from Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s' national past, revives the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "describe the eloquence of characters and the analysis of society", which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paulo Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, during the presentation of the film to a large team of performers.
May's blood with a length of over two and a half hours will be released in cinemas this Friday and more than four-hour TV series are planned for Telemadrid in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>se, José Luis Garci claims that by filming this film he has fulfilled a "children's dream", for which he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid commissioned him to shoot a picture of the two-year anniversary of the Epilogue of the 2nd of May.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has completely contributed, means for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a "a unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "a shattering Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom the country was to fight" VII.
The director regrets, however, that he could not count on the financial support that had been given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala sade) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the amount of May's Blood -, so he could not shoot some scenes from the screenplay signed at the same time by Horaci Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel.
The director of the film "To start again" (Volver a comparci<0xC3><0xB3>n) works as usual - on stage together with actors, with whom he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting, because it seems "degrading" to him and also thinks that "to participate in the vocation is part of the director's
Many of the actors he has chosen for May’s Blood have already appeared on his camera several times, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Butterfly, the film is being made by a young, unpretentious young man.
For this film Garcia does not expect any awards.
“At first, you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re only working for earnings, so you’re willing to make one more movie,” Garci, who has been directing for more than 30 years, said in a statement.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, of the Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, pioneering women’s emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me - it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, we're talking about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" evoked a guajira or "snake dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic.”
The performance is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabelle in one performance as well as in "La puerta aperta" (The Open Door), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who has made an exception and joined the collaboration with her ex-girlfriend.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she has accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Pac Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the drums of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who is always in the role of an eternal guide who is in love with this kind, a primalgirl.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at one time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The performance begins today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
The book "Diary of the newlyweds" also closes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the newlyweds" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia" and the celebration of the 2006 Noob<0xC3><0xB3>n celebrations.
The "Trinal of Zenobie and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" is ending with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a repair of the Nobel Museum House, and a traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: That Ray of the Sun" which would have been opened in New York in May of this year, and a revival of the
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the newlyweds" edited by Pedre Tabernera and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and works of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like itself that much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Bad Intention" and, under the weight of the knowledge that Newman has left, reveals his unsatisfied vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew that he was seriously ill.
But he was a guy for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
He died the father of film and country in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at its bottom, when they are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When time is rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those you admire - you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from an anti-drugs foundation based on the honor of the eldest son who died of an overdose to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A complete treasure for the country, which has cost a lot of effort to get rid of the suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has the courage to label Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has put a pretty tall lattice on all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live the way Paul Newman lived, "he's built on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even though he certainly had more than enough opportunities to be absent.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he joked.
May he be accompanied in heaven by the pride that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and his admirers - this is not very common in America.
“Of all the great roles he embodied, he was the most proud of being a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist.”
Imperfect races of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it will be possible in 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're going to run yesterday's race, I say no!
It was said to be the perfect race, and in my judgment, it was the worst race I've ever been in.
Such a mess of nonsense that if the evaluation had taken place right away and I was the examiner, it would clearly have been insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty much one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number, which is why you have to leave first.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent the track from overflowing).
Oh, no, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after standing the proper line) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
All right, well, those are the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the front on it lasted over 15 minutes, he had to give up his backpack there.
The wait time lasted over 35 minutes, which is something incomprehensible at a race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when it did, picking up was much worse.
In addition, the wait prolonged the rain by 40 minutes, which led to a general insurgency and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I guess, didn't record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this one.
So I think we're going to have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on New Technologies, Microsoft unveiled further developments in a new AI-enabled image recognition and human interaction system — not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the company’s premises) and perceiving what they are doing.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can find out how many people are in the room, who they are — even remember what they’re wearing — and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort present people by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that speaks to him, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see anyone, and tells her that he's going to dedicate himself to her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Stunning.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as thunder, considering that Microsoft version from version adds to Windows new features and other "extras".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's the truth.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as the truth relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the internet every day than around windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompanies the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I have a small example here.
I took this photo in a Microsoft employee restroom in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shimmered in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "The Witch", and in addition is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can dive right into the image of a typical musculoskeleton with a pointed moustache that lifts the dumbbells in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's underpants, snug and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all others.
Firstly, for its colloquial name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, according to legend, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost inconspicuous) Belgian flag, which have models of the most emblematic leggings as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
It's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't care who's a father."
Her huge appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Cruz's sisters are taking their new fashion appearances very seriously.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just some pretty, famous girls lending their name.
In Paris, the promotion event organized by Mango in its new headquarters took place, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's heartfelt and daring, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that Sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and at the same time I have participated in the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a difficult but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50s and 60s, and we have drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around wearing clothes, dressing and layering their clothes, I do this very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I liked clothes for a long time, I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, talk in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I walk dressed.
But you know that we dancers rely on how we are adjusted to feel good on our lessons and rehearsals while looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've been in your 30s lately, have you had a crisis?
Absolutely not.
I'm feeling better than I've ever been in my 30s.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want for a while, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know that I will be a mother because my body asks for it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are several premieres of films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course it can't be done.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora" and "En busca de la tomba de Cristo".
Intentionally, how you'll like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the show pier next to Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going to get on the pier as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to attend a charity show for her organization "Women for a better life", and the clothes that we showed - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - were not auctioned off and the proceeds were before this event.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things being said about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's engaged in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but when she asked me to do a stand, I would do it too.
For the benefit of the women of the Third World, I will do what is necessary.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Interior Ministry requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install in his car a system that will prevent him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was announced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to undergo a traffic retraining course.
In addition to the National Office for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists accused more than once of driving intoxicated will again sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permissible concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in this regard in the USA in 2007 showed that infractions were reduced by 65 % in the first year since the introduction of the device.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behavior before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its introduction, since the legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party), which recommends the installation of this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 5.40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City, where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but its rays still had to close their eyes in order to see the next pair coming out of the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, so that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport at that time to pick up people... she's out of here or whatever...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, so it's...
The Mexican press, however, knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just off the red carpet and military cordon, which is made up of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The Prince appears with a smile on her lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very sparsely dressed and with fluffy hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. there is a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and unwillingly pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, they are waiting for a narrated Mexican television reporter.
The best-selling fashion price
I don’t think there’s a better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and I don’t think there’s a better designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation of new talents in the fashion industry.
The price is subsidized by the amount of 300,000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her proposals in the exhibition Manga at the Haussmann Boulevard 54 in Paris and almost cried with a sigh.
Of course, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and was just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is located in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designers Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to finally have a lavish dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The president's table, solemnly decorated by Mango, looked a little more amazing next to Chagall's most significant works.
Nati, who, with heartbroken grief over her brother's recent death, showed nothing, put on the dress of this brand and the ELAH jewels over which her breath was concealed, and hung in her son Luis - a nearly two-metre elegant - accompanied Valentina on his forehead on the table.
Andik, the boss and owner of the Mango company, welcomed himself and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, for they both offered them to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - self-designed - pants and shirts, and at dinner dressed in long black sexy dresses, took a night walk through the Opera with Goya Toledov<0xC3><0xA1>, showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals and at the end of the evening, the ballet rehearsals.
Inés Sastre did not stop for a tour of the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could soak up the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Intercontinental Hotel with his own bed linen and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrance in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and angry everyday life.
And not to mention, they are all summed up in one book, which on September 30 will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm bell rings every morning at 7 a.m. as punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hasty rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat everyday exhaustion and to detach from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing smaller than 1001.
Susannah Marriott’s off-the-shelf yoga position, classic massage and “spa” therapy on the pages of her book has gathered a whole “menu” of options tailored to each individual’s tastes and time options.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers, will bring peace to the bookstore.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may frighten you, but in reality it is irrelevant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke from his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once in a few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is only one reason that explains its origin.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rages, nocturnal enuresis (nighttime assistance) or lunacy, but it may not be so.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or irritable situations.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be appropriate for the child to observe and consult with a specialist to find out if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilokvie appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that he will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Helpful advices
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore he rests.
Remember that if you feel that you are very worried several times in a row, it would be advisable to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from him.
It will be useless because when she sleeps, she is not aware that she can organize her thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he is saying, but you do not know what he is saying, and therefore why he is saying it, so pay close attention to how you interpret the information and to what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not funny.
That's really annoying.
Don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of sluggishness.
Without playing a big game, the blacks created more chances and were able to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were difficult to advance.
After the captain's first attempt to host Kauffmann, who shot from a distance just a hair past the joint, began to have Illhaeusern slightly upwards and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch and left only agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, thanks first to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well placed for handling the ball reflected after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
G<0xC3><0xB3>lman Illhaeusern, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and thus leave his teammates in weakness.
Dannemarie, however, could not recover from this, and the eleven of the Illhaeusern, who had withdrawn only a little to "tighten" the defence, caused no greater trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the ridge after the great turmoil.
Sarkozy goes out to angry fishermen.
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a drive across Brittany.
Faced with a demonstration by fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter have promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "it will come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysee Palace, said: “The president will speak with them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay for sailors.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be an uncompromising fisherman.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out the operation "Hlem<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xB0>" (operations of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of constipation.
The recreational port at Quiberon was also blocked, but the links towards Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
A filtration dam has been established on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, when they burned tires and pallets at the ports of Brest and Lorient just before dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in the Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding to act.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is due to decide how to continue on its path, and to participate in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Fisheries Department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not let go of anything" and "they do not want to arrive in Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the department of fisheries in Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability threshold of the ship is only reached if the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman 's
An unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.

Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that is hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its 2008 supply assumptions with 215 devices delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in the span of eight years.
AIG plans to divest 15% of its assets
An insurer of the American International Group, which has been handed over to U.S. monetary authorities, is considering handing over more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it was given in advance, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, the journal specifies, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG board met on Sunday evening to examine the possible assignment.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities seizing 80% of its capital while diluting it to an appropriate shareholder ratio.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to rescue banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell from 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point decline in its history (by 684.81 points) occurred on September 17, 2001, on the day of the resumption of trading following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq Index, with the dominant technological component, lost, according to the final post-trading data, 199.61 points and settled at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Defunct since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally collapsed after unexpectedly rejecting a plan to save the House of Representatives’ banks, a plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market, which sees that Congress is not able to adopt a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would come "too late."
“If this project is really doomed to collapse, the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks to ignite the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the downfall of one financial institution."
After the collapse of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organised the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not just dealing with the American crisis, but with the global crisis.
The bond market has risen sharply.
10-year cash receipt income fell to 3.632 % from 3.827 % on Friday evening, 30-year earnings to 4.161 % from 4.357 % on the previous day.
Obama Wins Points in First TV Duel
After the first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday, a second debate followed, whose task was to find out which of the two, John McCain and Barack Obama, won.
The Republican-Democrat campaign’s tents weren’t surprised when they both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday awarded Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said at the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent’s “naivety” in issues that formed the nucleus of the first clash.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an attacking spirit, Republican TV spots have been on the air since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't understand, while Obama did," a Democratic spot said this weekend, accusing the Republican of not sufficiently taking into account the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina after a heavy rain.
He didn’t even utter the words “middle class” or “worker.” The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more fit to save the economy on the edge of the abyss.
“Next week there could be a decisive upheaval,” said Charles Schumer, an influential Democratic senator.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “economic foresight” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and endorsed by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy is his number one priority, along with the introduction of the health care system.
McCain plans to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan that Congress adopted last night and which is highly unpopular.
"Did you notice that there were elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening, immediately after the closure of the polling stations in the main square in Minsk, to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the election: “What would it be like if they still did what they wanted with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian sex workers and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential who counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If any opposition MPs get to parliament, it will be by appointing them, not by electing them.
Their entry into parliament, however, can mean space on television, meetings in regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union is necessary.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we are not reforming, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has been monitoring the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has paved the way for all possible manipulations.
"What do you, have you noticed that there were some elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
“There was no foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most suited to the regime."
The silence of the night took place again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on the success.
Conversation - Blood, which is certain again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted that Héma-Québec had become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the light of this drama and public outcry, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations not to repeat such a disaster.
While Judge Krever lingered on the report, some provinces set in motion a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this role was taken up by the Gélinea Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to administer Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the Supply of All Provinces and Both Territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
Through continuous efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area, we have regained public confidence over the following years," he says, proudly adding that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population had already trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "confidence is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At the time, we were witnessing in Europe many cases of human-like mad cow disease, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says the woman who has led the company since its inception in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread with blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, in the event that we do not know this and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain, inevitably leading to death.
Thus, in April 1999, we rejected blood from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in the donor blood directly the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests were based.
NAT tests have shortened the deafening period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and without being able to find out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that before someone gets infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product appears.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe the blood transfusions needed to heal," said Hém-Québec's chief executive.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogenic element may appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
We need to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that Héma-Québec must also expect sufficient supplies in addition to safe supply.
“Needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate.
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer blood are not accepted because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mudslides are common, they are excluded for one year.
“With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network should be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Life today is so untied that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed, and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000 umbilical cord blood into the bank, and we expect to collect more than 1,000 of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the umbilical cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have enough funds to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the USL First Division semi-final series yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarter-final match played for the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 victory (4:3 is the goal balance after both games) over the Seattle Sounders.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
On Friday, during the first of two quarterfinal matches, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured in the semi-finals with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder made up a 3:1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is expected to clash with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed only today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens are ready to start the season.
The team consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plek<0xC3><0xA1>n and Andrej Kosticin last night at the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadiens 3:2 to separate strikes.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one touchdown in this fourth three-color victory from six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling an early election by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party congress ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's by-elections.
"Removing the Boundaries of Our Last Great Northern Border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visually compelling way yesterday at the conclusion of the Quebec Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a picture mill.
On three huge canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the view "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the fall, even though he said he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" the prime minister intends for Quebec, the vision of a "new economic space", which includes a labour force agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has often mentioned in his statements lately, it has never been the subject of a presentation before.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with huge potential", but did not specify the timing, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the very least, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further separated: in particular, hydroelectric power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The north, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as large as France is in us," "is in Quebec.
And it’s not just with us, it’s in us,” he said, as if to show that he appeals to a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after theatrically silenced himself to look at the huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one border line that has not been covered by the convention for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will open all year round as a result of the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The work was initiated by the Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be outlined".
Moreover, the development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was, after all, one of the still shaking themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s entry into the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Beauharnois headquarters to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of water power, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” Charest said.
At the press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time a conservative, namely to John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, which premiered from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base, evoking considerable applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the fall of this year, which allows him to do so by law.
However, he stressed that his program is packed, especially the missions of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the leader of the Liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "attempts to change the constitution", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands special recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint some members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting who would have veto power in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the Northern Plan in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again drew up the Development Policy of Northern Quebec, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she held on to it, "we would be further today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections take place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the Northern Plan in the government.
"But we want it not to be just a theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of "justice" (of irony) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louis Arbour that he represented a "shame" for Canada.
“To humiliate a woman who has waged an unrelenting struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this speaks volumes about the prime minister’s surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not relocated back to the homeland of its national imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account that at the time of the acts that were to take place, Omar Khadr was a teenage boy.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Canadian Bar Association are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is psychologically devastated in the future, and this is undoubtedly permanent, after so many years of torture.
We don’t realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our ‘democracy’, the words that Harper is so fond of and which sound so empty out of his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality anymore: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him at the will of the head of the minority government so far (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that proclaims virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It is a disgrace, Mr Toews, to renounce this, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, it confirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor little publisher for insulting honor in order to spark “transparent public debate” and demands six million of them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It’s no surprise that Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to bring to ruin anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend lavish sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a highly unbalanced battle against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
The tactic in these unbalanced struggles, moreover, often consists in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will shut the mouth of the other party and also frighten anyone who dares to dedicate himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the whole thing to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold is active, in Canada, the debate under normal circumstances is about exchanging ideas, and not about the wounds with the earrings.
So it was not enough for the mining companies to open up their books, their documentation and set up a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and scathingly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a “public debate” while at the same time disparaging the opinions of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice-presidential world refers only to the fat-paid lawyers, and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, they also have the right to speak out.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports Noir Canada authors and publishers, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining companies.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to be silenced (as part of its prosecution "public debate" the company Barrick by the way has just reported about, the official statement of Canada Novuvivi<0xC4><0x87>).
If we ignore Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to investigate and seek the truth that is essential to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are disliked by the rich companies of this world without being subjected to repeated persecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could be created if it followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no slightest desire to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures that would limit this type of unwarranted prosecution.
Operations to Save Wall Street – Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and Congressional backers, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been lurking on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of saved public money, new measures to capture the amount of houses seized due to non-payment, and the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers of saved companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, following the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything was done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans were safe from the crisis just going on on Wall Street,” he said.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do it, the trauma, chaos and disruption of Americans' daily lives will be huge," Gregg said.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have been on maximum turns for fear of the effect that the next failure would have on the mood of investors.
The time limit set was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to the negotiations later, and both spoke out rather for the agreement, without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed a supplement to the agreement on some measures, notably the one aimed at allowing homeowners to retain their homes, and the wages of state-run workers saved by companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features that I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to spend and use to move forward.
“Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy out dubious debts and risky and non-sales assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by a bubble burst in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of loans (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the collapse of banks and finances.
The fall of the first draft of the agreement last week is on the conscience of Republican MPs.
Since Democrats have come to the conclusion that for some “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty, the government will only guarantee, but will not buy them back, there is a belief that the deadlock is inflamed.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a provision was added that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it would have to take over losses as a result of the program for five years.
The new plan envisages a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion will be added if the president deems it necessary.
An additional $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies, which will pay him dividends in case of profit, and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the procedures for the seizure of real estate associated with the loans concerned by the plan, as well as setting limits on the amount of assessment and compensation paid to managers of affected companies.
Plan makers would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have a green one.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
“It’s absolutely clear that Washington can’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Earning money from taxpayers is not a solution.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Committee of Skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine which way to go," he said.
At the same time, it has been reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (US$2.9 billion) to the state in the wake of a crisis of risks.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the top 20 European banks and among the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is precisely what caregivers and households can appreciate in today’s uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to have begun to nationalize another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley banks, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, branches and client accounts of the British bank will be bought by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of Socially Engaged Icons
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and unwavering talent that were his own also distanced him from the power category that produces true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar to him and had long been a rival to him on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, the whole country looked in love with self-made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumphs in theater, television, and film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed second at the 24 hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also go the shadows of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the hustle and bustle of their own show business, which will forever remain to a certain extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend caused dizziness for film lovers, as his big roles competed together on a black canvas of memories.
After him, more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art parade.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From a less ancient past (1990), we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a perverted, violent, unforgettable offender from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 brought Newman to the real world.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, an Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), the same character portrayed in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
That face wandering ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his professional career, different epochs compete together.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its gilding, showcasing, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "a living challenge of underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as on trays, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despairers, whose fall and rebellions were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence, starring his wife Joanne Woodward, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, he dedicated Harry and Son to his son Scott, whom he lost to overdose, a work full of shame and sadness.
In a homage to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (who played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of the decline of Hollywood.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which might have seemed quite tasteless to us, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
Newman thus, rather than let himself be swayed by fame, engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be able to follow the path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of long-standing and systematic fraud by a criminal organization that has resulted in extraordinarily significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved the fulfilment of tasks by fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local governments - in the total of about 65 million forints - traveled partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The way in which the investigating authority also informed was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual countervailing value and that the undertakings entered into by the association were never received.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were fake.
Prints for these invoices came from the Yozsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies on which the invoices are to be produced were decided, among other things, on a round trip along the northern shore of the Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Ladose sent J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look out for pensions and restaurants.
In them he asked for bills for his consumption, according to the model were then produced invoices submitted in the framework of public competitions issued, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, the Self-Government of the capital.
Mostly Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados exhibited the invoices with his partner Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study journey" Lados looked out for a beer cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitable facility provided catering for the ninety-member group of Biztos Pont.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not come to this device at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was fraught with formal and substantive errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, but one hundred and thirty guests were mentioned on the invoice.
However, the printers with a rich imagination exaggerated this even when they mentioned on the documents a company that is also dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office he made the documents that sounded like Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp.
The head of the company Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
In addition to the formalities, he also disagreed with the fact that according to the invoice they accommodated 100 people, because they only have eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also mentions catering, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The ardent invoice manufacturers were also not convinced that the Budapest travel agency only organises foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which was also not in line with the invoicing practice of the company, they stated that they were foolish as a service of travel brokerage in Hungary.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was also stated in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
The four documents issued by Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért by Hotel Révfülöp s.r.o. did not agree with the amount of VAT, among other things. The company's activities are not covered by the mentioned 25 percent, but by the 15 percent VAT, but in addition, the hotel's employees only issued printed invoices.
In addition, the "issuers" corrupted the invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it turned out, thanks to the investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office, as an activity carried out by road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért and the associations XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, has also been leaked due to formal deviations - inappropriate format of the invoice and incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives denied that the invoices were issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from the association Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért was eating there, which is why according to our information the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that the paper would be issued by him.
Invoices are deliberately
The second group of invoicers is those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. was, according to the indictment, led to the issuance of a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> with invoices worth about five million forints, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the created invoices were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations already forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> s.r.o., dealing with the trade in fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not located.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data established by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalask company Cash Investment s.r.o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The head of the company was a man from Romania, who was supposed to hand over documents related to the company to Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and the Együtt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért foundations and accepted their countervailing.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian Masons established Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued on behalf of the companies invoices to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3> connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor’s office concluded that Kubatov had made up 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT.
The man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time for the competition for the association Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szovetség and Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mih<0xC3><0xA1>lye T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsicse Foundation (TMA), a publicly-profit organisation of the Socialist Party.
They won 500 thousand forints each, but did not spend the sums on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home inspection in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, part of the defendants will probably describe the course of invoice production, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything himself to the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take care of it.
He could have been insulted for the time being, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, that is, to place him in a domestic prison, remained unanswered until now.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have inflicted much greater damages that have not yet been repaid, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this possibility.
The psychology of trumps: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known—and seemingly irrational—behavior were revealed to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lag behind in an eBay auction contest, so they’d rather pay too much.
With the help of an experimental auction, the research tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a play auction, with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method examining the active brain areas of the subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, an important element of which is to beat the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensely during the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-replacement" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the price tightening can therefore be explained by trying to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the ranks of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
Members of the other group were also promised that if they came out victorious, they would receive another $15 in reward.
The third group, on the contrary, received $ 15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that one group emphasized victory and the other group emphasized defeat.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
“These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
These have so far explained the phenomena observable during auctions of joys of victory and avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to seek a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, characteristic is inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the origins of the disease, spread in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E of the digestive system (for example, infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against viruses A and B, there is no type C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected meal, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
After that, a yellowing, lightening of the stool and darkening of the urine is formed on the skin and on the whites of the eyes. Treatment can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die of a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is treated with medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells maliciously, and so the first symptoms will appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to timely prevention, to carry out regular screening.
In three groups, the disease occurs much more frequently than the average: among people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his/her doctor if he/she notices any symptoms of unknown origin.
With timely detection, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn’t it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God acts as a certain analgesic that could have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment to explore how a person’s belief in a god’s perception of pain is affected, the British daily Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all watched the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of in-depth examination of the human brain, it was also shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The research is the first of a series of studies in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate in addition to academics.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to carefully observe two paintings: Sassoferrata's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the Leonardo da Vinci border, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a certain state of piety in the faithful, while they chose the da Vinci image because it does not differ much from the first and seems to them a calming impression.
Subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching an image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "cared for" and "calm down, they were filled with peace."
When they looked at a religious image, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerfully impressive image even in atheists, it is only necessary to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they would perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the pain control of believers if they showed them some madona from Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
On their tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they have been on vacation, what professional examinations are going on, and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives, that’s still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics paralleling Orwell’s dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary in order for the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to a spokesman for Google, the company is only at the beginning of its ten years of world-class work to be able to work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied that if Google could answer questions such as “what am I supposed to do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would be right for me?” — such seemingly simple questions, however, the software users will not know how to answer the information until then.
Not all Internet users know well that the searched words are accurately captured during an Internet search, as well as from which IP address they were searched and to which pages they were moved after searching.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their browsing history, they can look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which, in the long term, they generate finds adapted much more directly to them - based on the same system-based products will be based on the same logic, and the service will be based on recommendations, recommendations and recommendations.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - ask users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is rather horrifying, the counter-reaction does not provoke guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all searched terms are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from Orkut community sites established through it.
However, Internet users who are concerned about privacy rights could still take a break in May when the company, hand in hand with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google may not be forced by any article of the Constitution to release any information in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained by appealing to the strengthening of the law passed years ago on the protection of children, but it failed to get the lists of web pages and the lists of searchable individuals.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear providing their personal data because they feel that their private sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google’s services, exposed to harm, and against it with a revolt, which belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, gathering around them enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, see him as a new generation of big business, a "corporation that is now fracturing," unlike its rival Microsoft, which is considered to be the world for Windows.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than the practice of official software.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship of the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, about deliberately leaving traces behind and using the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Picnov, which can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, recording the music he listens to, all this can then be connected to the most popular navigation systems, such as Blip p.F.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which he reveals: the girlfriend in the morning when looking at the flood of photos of common friends easily finds out with whom her quirky friend spent the evening, or the company can throw away his employee just because he has a fairy tale on his blog.
He who lives online life consists of what he shows from himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google’s monopoly has the option (starting with Scrooge, which uses Google’s search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, a large number of people do not intentionally register on community sites, so that they can not be found. The online application Google from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and which of us do not build the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is not too secretly expecting Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad space is jeopardizing ad agency investments, and services introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously disrupting Microsoft’s business.
Critical observers, however, also find a counterpoint to the 2006 skepticism, with a disturbing impression of the skepticism: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of the employees after raising the fee for the company kindergarten, the skepticism of the skepticism of the skepticism, the skepticism of the skepticism of the employees, the s of the s, the skepticism of the s.
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new services in advance, but only when it can already be used, it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can push the world to new places: while some people think that Google's project will be focused on scanning and archiving.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes a future with Orwellian reminiscences, in which one can approach man terribly well only with the help of data from Google.
The double murderer from Ozda was helped to remove the traces of two teenagers
Two juveniles were interrogated by police in the case of the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zda, according to reasonable suspicions they helped to remove traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have learned of the activity from which they were suspected and are currently being charged with assisting in the crime.
The two teenagers, according to MTI two girls, are being prosecuted at large.
Assisting in a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of a pre-planned multiple homicide for no apparent reason.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed the 53-year-old a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to an office in Ozda, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers are already commemorating "the second of 11 September".
We can thank the U.S. president for the global financial disaster, accuses the Roman La Repubblica. The president was not even able to shake his own party in support of that rapidly reversing bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second of September 11th.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees a culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has brought to the brink of collapse the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is constantly growing, and the entire world will eventually pay for it.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline at the money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
But if more banks collapse as cubes, then neither money nor improvisation will suffice.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, incumbent monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Vienna Standard, according to which fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets in order to resolve the crisis, are becoming increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously dealt with the tsunami-like crisis on the old continent.
The “saviors” do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros at once, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to resort to taxpayers’ money to avoid further damage.
Smart car mimics the flight of a camel
What, then, would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
In the case of bees, for example.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was inspired by the engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed the BR23C biomimetic robotic steering system, a robotic mini-car that is equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s chief technology PR and R&D officer, explained at the show.
An important role is played by the folded eyes, which allow the bees to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, engineers came up with the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters from the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car begins to mimic the movements of the bee and by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision, it immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is done in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, a robot car would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective packaging, inside which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, in the case of a robot car, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, an instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the processing ability, let alone the storage of data.
This mechanism must process and respond only to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store and respond to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only a few kilobytes of memory.
It does not need a memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of technology for immediate avoidance that, according to Nissan’s estimates, could reach mass-produced vehicles in ten years.
Another option may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damn dear child already has a name
The $700-billion bailout bill, which is to be split into several instalments and aims to buy back bank loans of poor quality, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further talks, which ended only on Saturday after midnight U.S. Eastern Time, congressional officials reached an agreement in a few days of debate over a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson on the outcome of the compromise said: "The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
On the draft legal norm hearing in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be established by the program, the House of Representatives will vote on Monday first, then the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which reports of the deal were also welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, by the way, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that a total of $700 billion should be spent on repurchasing low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the things are expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy securities secured by mortgages, which will be valued by the presidents as low-quality, then by the fate of the 100 billion.
The program will be controlled by a special committee, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy out low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans, respectively.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry said.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on the funds that constitute a cause for concern, for which the companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or to prevent systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the chiefs of the banks, who have got into trouble and are waiting for the help of the state, can count on the government to reduce their margins - which in the overseas slang is simply called a "golden parachute".
Restrictions on their payments will only occur in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the manner of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys under the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachute unless the fallen directors of the banks are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of the direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It is necessary to add that the existing contracts for gold traps will not change, the restrictions apply only to new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors-general,” said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State will have the right to obtain a stake in the participating banks, thereby reducing the risk to taxpayers, since once the economy and the rescued bank get on their feet, they can also make a profit from this transaction.
In the next five years, the president is required to submit a proposal to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be reimbursed to taxpayers.
There were, of course, voices of doubt on both sides of the plan.
“This is not what the American people have asked us to do, because it will not protect taxpayer dollars,” California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said in a statement.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it was precisely those who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who insisted on adopting the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were higher by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices were 0.7 per cent higher compared to the previous month and rose by 3.2 per cent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by just 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and shoe industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to an inter-month increase in prices in the manufacture of handkerchiefs and saddle products by 4.6 per cent and in the production of footwear by 2.5 per cent respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products industry (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machines and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we have seen a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the sector of production and distribution of electricity, gas and water, which plays a major role in the domestic sales of industry, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially established increase in gas prices since July 1.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices rose the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical sector, it was possible to observe a 13.2% increase, in the area of the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then a 11% increase in prices.
Price reductions occurred in the textiles and textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry rose by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors exceeded the previous year’s prices by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector focus, in August domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the sectors dealing with the production of tangible assets.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The biggest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we have seen a price increase of 6.8 per cent, compared with a 1.4 per cent drop in prices for tangible assets.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in the twelve-month comparison.
In one month, our domestic payment slipped 1.7 per cent against the euro, 7.1 per cent against the dollar, up 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends only on the timely construction of an electronic system of road permits, or controls, at sea".
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include entry permits, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy has been in talks in Washington since today.
He meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with a star of the Order of Merit to the Republic of Hungary, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates for both major U.S. parties, on Sunday unanimously pledged their support for a $700 billion bailout package, but there are also politicians calling for the finance minister’s resignation.
After a several-day marathon of meetings between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement on the bank bailout package was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to reshape the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are similarly described as the most suitable of the two candidates to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, at the same time as they have come to the forefront of economic issues, Obama once again gained a certain advantage and McCain’s lead, which he secured after the Republican convention nominated Sarah Palin as vice president, melted away.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama said Sunday at an election rally in Detroit that he hoped the $700-billion package would be swiftly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We need to act immediately, responsibly ... to your locations, to your savings, to the entire industry, to the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about economics obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a bit of a mess for everyone ... but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.”
As the Republican senator stated, the proposal includes the establishment of a committee to supervise the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the deferral for the top officials on whom he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more important role in the negotiations, on the contrary, he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press overview of the German language region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderites are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers".
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday ended a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, during the Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the rate they have been very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of education, the resettlement of Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is associated with the growth of possibilities, which has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more self-confident, more critical, more self-absorbed.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant of the classical civic strata; people in freelance occupations, businessmen, individuals with a bachelor’s degree and with a higher education.
CSU support has already dropped below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidents of the parties are restrained in the questions of the coalition" deals with the confused domestic political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much to look into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed that he would like to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, Faymann remained open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overrated for every drop.
A repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party so far, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> Chairman Jörg Haider was once again open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equality, hosted this year by France, the current president of the European Union, began today in Paris.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert discussion in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their treatment.
The summit was launched by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
Invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations working in the field of equal opportunities met for discussion.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs of the movement Fidesz J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labor, Roma are forced from the European labor market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve higher levels of education."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these connections in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of the Roma to their citizenship of the European Union is the need to guarantee the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their not too good and separate education," emphasized L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In her view, the European Union needs consistency, with an emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, in order to speed up the desegregation processes of schools immediately, and it is crucial that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are properly complied with.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide the Roma children with the opportunities given to them by the democratic space so that they, as full citizens, can participate in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> demanded.
In the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Summit on Equality, held every year since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set out at the level of the whole of Europe and of individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Mercy
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the Bavarian CSU.
Party President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress last October weekend.
In any case, members of the highly criticized duo were told that they would not stick to their posts.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to bring about personal consequences.
Five years ago - indeed, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of his career - the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strength was only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, the CSU has been producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP “self-governing” for 46 years.
Although the conservatives in the southern federal country, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to have a high standing, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a close intelligence team, which will start the polling negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with the right-wing group of Free Voters, will also be able to be Vice-President and the Federal Minister of the country.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out a coup, entered the House as a candidate for the Free Voters, but then made a ruthlessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber will also play an active role, who has so far spun threads from the background, the former country's prime minister and former president of the CSU called September 28 the saddest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber shoved a few bitter remarks to the CDU, according to him, they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, somehow puts its joint forces on their feet.
According to Merkel, who had difficulty concealing her disappointment due to the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions would not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the injured CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 percent of the worst result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition member entered the Belarusian parliament in Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of a 10 million country has been lacking opposition for well over a decade, the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had left the president on the basis of a change in the constitution to re-election in the elections with a debatable process in 2006, would be able to re-election.
The ODS has also resigned from the boycott previously considered.
Against the backdrop of oppositional expectations, the political attitudes of the increasingly economically dependent anti-Russian countries - which have taken credit for mitigating the impact of Russia's constantly rising imports of natural gas - and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of the pipelines from Russia, was satisfied with the political attitudes of the Russians.
The release was previously pointed out that the OSCE emphasized positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign, and not shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE flash report on Monday already had reservations about a campaign during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present for the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, the political system can only be improved: the political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to allow itself with Moscow even in smaller confrontations, when it continues to refuse to recognize the moon of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, not the moon of South Ossetia and the moon of Abkhazia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remains so, even though "she is too afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament."
When looking at the results of the opposition, it does not plan protests, but rather tries to deliver its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is being hampered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, noting that the Lukashenko regime, which considers socialism as its greatest success, does not consider the government as the most socially successful.
"Due to the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'inducing the silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the Community of Independent States mission Sergei Lebedev told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a rotating door has been introduced upon the arrival and departure of employees.
But from today onwards, this new measure will start to work against the skewed people, against those who sneeze and then go to coffee during working hours.
The news against lazy people was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renata Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
“The swivel doors,” Brunetta says, “are a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services.”
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta added.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of the rotating door is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the staff, the Secretary-General assures: "This was a joint procedure with the staff and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, “There’s nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o’clock in the morning.”
During one conference at the Higher Professional School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Their pay dynamics have doubled in the last 8-10 years with respect to the private sector and are much higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject Brunett’s standards in line with a request backed by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration is presenting figures today on lower absences from work due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘urgent lazy people’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In Tara, there will be protests in particular against the exclusion of hospital surcharges, which depend on the activity; the extension of the period during which the patient can be checked, the period in which control visits will be carried out, and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work-related accidents occur, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths from work-related injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
In order to re-energize the attention of institutions, social and information media on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all Italian regions the 58th national day of victims of occupational accidents set for the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is," said President Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Deprived and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his lively admiration for the continuous joint efforts for safety at work, for the protection of injured workers, for the assistance of the families of the victims and for the participation of the public opinion.
Naturally, an indignant 'enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that, by their scale, provoke upheaval in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the daily reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in its dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources here: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance in order to raise awareness among young people facing the world of work.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that "the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social state, insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary end of this state."
"As far as accidents at work data are concerned, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from accidents at work is as alarming as ever," said President Anmilo Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘decrease effort’ to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
“We believe that in general, too little is being done to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - stressed Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, from the school age".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon, which is an exceptional social phenomenon . ".
In the end, Mercandelli stated that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation expected for work-related victims and the “dismissal of supportive care” that the system has been receiving in recent years.”
"The aim is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance back, because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislature."
MP3 Players Accused of Exposing Hearing to Risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time and using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing loss.
According to today's announcement by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks recently raised and identified (Csrseri) EU in an official report published in Brussels.
“From this scientific view, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a week, and keep the device at high volumes, risk permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m concerned that so many young people who use often portable musical devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreversible way,” Kuneva said.
"From scientific findings - continues the leader - there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we must encourage consumers and make this information public.
We need to continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to become fully effective and to keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm that there is a need to be concerned and the European Commission will now examine together with the other members and parties who raised the problem what measures could possibly be introduced to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the source of which is the noise."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that when users of portable music devices use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours per week, they will exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time run the risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantity can be counted between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free passage to the Commission for the future of the capital
We will start today, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracall Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will compile manuals for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, the Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its councillor Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno wants to emphasize – it will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It’s not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to process a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have a precise deadline.
In June, the Mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To those who accuse the Commission of futility, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of the same quality as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics pays off on everyday problems and on emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not stand even the euro and will serve to reflect and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, in order to allow our city an authentic rise to the level it necessarily needs, and to think unitedly about its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome clarifies, "will not be limited only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and St. Petersburg".
Obama? The first anti-American president. It is already known why
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he’s going to get to the top post of the nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere!”
In fact, these attacks do not say much; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, from the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality, which remained skewed until the last moment, comes to the surface.
“Say what you want, and we’ll eventually figure out for ourselves who to flag, whether Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
1,500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term in office? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers died and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States was also felt by journalists: there is an investigative period in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they had less concern about credibility.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists questioned, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, to change fundamentally.
The American journalist is permeated by a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten newspaper journalists and senior executives are convinced that journalism is going the wrong way on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcasting.
For journalists, it is not difficult to see where the website is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of the press.
"Economic pressure," to which journalists point out, has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred respondents admitted that they resorted to technology in the hopes of “doing something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms — that is, the executives — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "safe work" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose a job in three years are at the national level 47%.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are at 30%.
As for the "certain work" related to the staff (our editors, eds) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a nation as huge as the United States, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a question of taking it or leaving it.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month apart from paying pensions and insurance.
With regard to holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until reaching fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own admissions, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STRESSES IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to refuse the filing of the businessman with real estate Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-offer on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from home prison last week, which was turned into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate entrepreneur to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which PM expressed) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan proposed by the White House: a large part of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirms this, informing us that the current crisis is dividing Washington’s Republican party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, friendly to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is on the contrary “conservative, hostile” to the states.
A soul that expressed itself arrogantly in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this is just an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of the phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which are strained in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of state-power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are mostly included.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the question or has nothing much to add: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is as always divided between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide on a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get into distress, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try to put everything in order.
And it also possesses the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to such an extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in full harmony with the ever-increasing importance which attempts to attribute to one factor the recent economic progress closely associated with it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the sieve, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, from nothing we realised that our future would have to be sweated with.
All things, who would have said it, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to the confined space, the territory.
So, who becomes their ruler, certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty, which, however, predicts a break.
He who speaks of territory, state, government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, an awareness that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discredit towards existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, troubling: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
For it seems to be spreading more and more in the broad masses of the population the conviction that their actions are the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership feeds on the subterranean one branch of the Bush; but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in the sudden electoral "repulsions" or in the unexpected changes of the collective mood in the last and last years, from the British to the British, in the last and last years, in the
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, one would say their format, have ever greater problems to understand, to represent, which, not from today, is being created through the deep layers of Western societies, and that the post-economic crisis is spreading again.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to speak of a permanent “mass rebellion”.
But we certainly can't say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a hundred kilograms body stuck on a vertical wall with a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some University researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of already existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The basis of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes laid as an organized pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “simply detaches from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking about far less fascinating uses as a combination of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering .
So far, no superheroes.
MORE RESEARCH – Also, the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists presented a microfiber-shaped glue as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their consumption changes the enhancement or reduction of effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the health risks of both ready-made and fresh-to-use juices for patients at the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm is being raised: one glass of grapefruit juice and a glass of grapefruit juice are needed to make their lives more risky.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
Medications at Risk – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a bulletin two years ago, and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink when taking medications, such as Diazepam or Met.
NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen the drugs.
A long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan, said: "Such discoveries are usually immediately communicated to various international and national pharmacological agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange informational instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative drug tickets you get, and if you encounter something vague, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.”
The Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Yorker who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a New York Times commentary that the second event would be, in terms of consequences for U.S. history, far more important than the first.
A prediction that caused a lot of controversy and that was refuted for years, but proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and shocked at how quickly collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Biniho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is “an economist of great importance” but also a popularizer who has “a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberal administration.”
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package aimed at reaching more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with a variety of novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window are added another, much more significant, such as the compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support of the new format ISO 1.2.
Emphasis is also placed on collaboration with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of your PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transferring electronically, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphical model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids" that resemble typical graphics of the Adobe format and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each employee is assigned one color to the comments to be clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should reset the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And while the theme of gratuitousness can be a drag on the expansion in households, it is the business area of Open Office that the package bets a lot, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we are at almost 3 million and 600,000 today, with the release of a new version it is possible that this expected number can be exceeded.
Also Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an Bernhard Kohl, from the team of Gerolsteiner, the third ranked and winner of the shirt of the best mountaineer.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive on Cer, Epo third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall within those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the checks confirm positive on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the set two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positive attitude to the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the result.
26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, he also won the best top scorer's scorer's T-shirt.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS IT, IS ITALY RASIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into a priority target of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what is asked in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibra from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, because he stole
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as "the paradox of the north": the northern regions are simultaneously those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant mindset in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation demanded by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jew has already reached such dimensions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear," explains the head of the Sunia studios' office, Laura Mariani, in this city, a large demand from the students, which has distorted the market.
In most cases, the rental offer contains several offences: contracts free of charge, unregistered, without limited rental, and related sub-leasing.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices thanks to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, one bed is needed for about 450 euros, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (the Bande Nere area) through the average value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in a double.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We will only save if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples it is necessary for a bed 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bar they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to the Italian ones.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, cities destroy historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-sales in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of mono-sales in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
“It’s as if we’ve lost a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a piece of the road and a lot of emotions,” says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won a lifetime Oscar for Tornator and a grand prize in Cannes.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and the highest bill paid mainly halls in the most important cities: about 10 less in Florence, about 9 in Milan, about 6 in Milan, about Neapoli
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna, with a loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian approach has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Not to mention the insufficient subsidy to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous public debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year would be needed to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historical centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned norms are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the zone with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and in some car parks.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to establish the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialta or Quirinale in the Rue Nazionale, where I have shared so many emotions that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side.
Connection between politics and mafia group 'ndrangheta, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli."
The charges brought by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and Mayor Rosarna Carla Martelli, who was detained this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are grave.
In the tracks also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson a lawyer, the nominee of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, when two local administrations expressed willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“This would allow the mafia group – the judges write – to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate the already huge possibilities of control and management of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are much in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, the heroes who are still unstained.”
The arrests this morning follow a July arrest last year that police showed that the Mafia group Piromalli had received a final crackdown.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioiia Tauro had been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this was the supposed link between organized crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of office in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of the Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the centre-right coalition at the time of the dissolution after narrower elections in May.
He was screaming about a scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of the then deputy interior minister Marc Minniti, accusing him of taking over everything for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to ask for a change.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the prosecutors write, revealed "a willingness to shift the claims of an entrepreneur, a representative of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, outflows are the new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of giants like Chevron, who is now trying to reach out to these sources, have clung.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now the environmental organizations and the new rise in oil prices have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
That would be twice the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides and outflows.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build the facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” said a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil giant in the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspaper, “and is thinking about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining the authorization from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are monitoring the marine energy footprint, and the amounts invested so far, although not in detail known, show growing interest, according to observers.
The technology needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the dilution.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of struggles that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed by the cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is supplied to the shore by submarine cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type at the project stage, which are only waiting for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power is already producing power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the tide and outflow causes the turbines to rotate, which by this rotating movement are powered by the generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization because of the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tides and after the tides.
A special interest at this point deserves the potential of tidal and outflow, say the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although it is an incoherent factor, tides and tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is in the energy of tidal and outflow states like New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal states already invested $7 and a half million in 2008, and predicted investments up to $35 million for 2009.
