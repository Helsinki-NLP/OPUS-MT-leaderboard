Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility of being 'perceived as an eagle'
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament — Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM across the political spectrum is concerned that this could make them a laughing matter.
One of the Labour Party AM explained that their group is concerned about "the resonance with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "one-way", while "pwp" means "cookie".
The parties Plaid AM indicated that none of the group was "not satisfied" and have recommended alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to consider the name change, but added that the MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "arm".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English dialect of Yorkshire "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on changing the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on which terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which received broad support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name AM, the Commission preferred the "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
AM clearly recommends alternatives, but the fight for an agreement could cause headaches for Assembly spike Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on amendments will also include other changes in the work of the assembly, including laws on AM disqualification and the structure of the committee system.
The final AM vote on what they will be called will be held when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to resolve decades-long disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Giorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite's opponents of the name change, said he ignored the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply something that needs to be done to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are ringing, as the churches of Harlem fight for existence.
"As the old story goes, the people I spoke to used to be on every corner of the bar and the temple," says Mr. Adams.
"There's not one or the other now."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms that people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the temples, he worries that the money he receives from selling the property will end sooner than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be back to the starting point".
The temples, he added, may be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with apartment properties, which will house people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come when these deities will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who will gather in these apartment properties will become this threat."
Both houses were built by the white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s 10 years later.
The original white Methodist church left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshiped God nearby.
The black church of St. Martin's Church was taken over by his blessings during the time of John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who had refused to hire blacks for jobs or grants.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His Blessing is David Johnson, the son and successor of his father Johnson in the church of St. Martin, proudly called the game "the call of the poor man".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Linds, who moved to the largest call game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that the church of St. Martin did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s Cathedral reflected the relationship between architects and builders, some of whom had been attracted by secular power and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
The parish council, which consists of lay leaders, in July addressed the diocese in writing with concerns that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the activity of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teenager at Hummer Fishing Site
A shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who is diving for lobsters and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, according to the services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been in the water for about half an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the boy calling for help, and then the group chatted with him to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he had thought it was just a thrill about the lobster being caught, but then he "became aware that the boy was screaming, 'I'm sick!
I'm sick of it!"
All his keybone was wasted," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I scream for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammels.
The boy was taken by air to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was found to be critical.
The attacking shark species is not known.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles reported in a brief press release that a shark had been spotted in the area for a few weeks, but that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jail added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the lump.
For the duration and security of the investigation, officials blocked access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Encinitas for 48 hours.
Jail pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous for humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's attacks Boats, Superdrug, and Debenhams with a store-style beauty product line for shelves and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment of 2.8 billion pounds in the UK's large beauty market, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion goods and home-made items are declining, 11 stores in the country will try out larger shelves of beauty products in a year, and, if all goes well, there will be more shelves in the country.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in "Boots" stores, for example.
The supermarket also re-markets its "Boutique" decorative cosmetics line, in which most of the products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try a concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to small grocery purchases every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that retail outlets will become more and more similar to department stores as the chain of stores tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed the Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is alleged to have improved the flow of goods and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a defeat.
The Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute over how to distribute revenues from pharmacies to grocery stores.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281 large pharmacy business to the chain owner of Celesio, Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million 3 years ago.
According to this plan, the task of "Lloyds" will be to complement the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "To improve the customer-centric environment, we've redesigned the look and feel of our beauty product shelves.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now an enchanting destination on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges previous shopping habits."
Peter Johns "full of anger" after Holly Willoughby gives up the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "acquired anger" after TV show host Holly Willoughby renounced an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand Spector to bring all the attention to his brand and "new ones"
Villaubia has no time to devote to their home outfits and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to that of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
"This Morning" a 37-year-old broadcaster used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left "Dragon Den" star Peter Jones in a frenzy of fury as he stepped out of his lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last moment — to pay all attention to his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer.
Information sources claim that Jones was "full of anger" when a golden girl of TV was caught in a tight meeting Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and announced that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million dollars, "were out of time" and "will be worth up to $1.5 million."
The company was compared to the Guinevere Platrov brand "Goop", and, according to the hint, it will double the wealth of Villaubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving True, Jones moved away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of the information tells us: ""Truly"" was the main one of Holly's priorities.
It was to become her long-term future, which would be dedicated to the coming decades.
Her decision to resign surprised all the unprepared people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlova there is a warehouse full for sale of finished goods."
Experts believe that this morning’s executives, one of the most financially lucrative stars, can pay the company millions because a lot of money has been invested in a variety of products – from pillows and candles, to the market for clothes and home goods, and even more to delay it.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in a close relationship for 10 years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby "Truly" was formed with Kepa in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both couples spend holidays together, and Joanns owns 40% of the shares in the Boldvina TV producer firm.
Willoughby is set to become the brand's M&S ambassador, and she will replace Enthusiast Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
A source close to Johnston said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business deals!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was appalled by the criticism that news companies will receive of the comment, which some may find "indecent" to the president, and the fact that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has the President refused so much?
Trump said in his portrayed "news dictator" voice.
"I didn't give up on anything!"
He said Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the talks on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho), informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a US "response" to the North's turmoil.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his home speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results — the cessation of missile decommissioning tests, assistance in the release of prisoners and the return of the remaining American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's just to make an impression on the president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this tightly populated area, we have 200, here, here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs, for example, were told that their assistance was not needed.
While more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so this is a known problem," said Ms Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" gathers a group to drive to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to the assistance.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely vulnerable to natural turmoil.
While shelter tsunamis have been created in Aceh, they are rarely found along other shores.
Most likely, the death was also affected by the fact that Palu did not respond to the warning sirens about the tsunami, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new character.
President Joko Widodo had made upgrading Indonesia's damaged infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr Joko's administration and they are expected to be re-elected next year.
Moreover, Mr Joko has to deal with the protracted problem of tension between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: "Liverpool" player Daniel Starridge with a spike restores the balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri, being about 25 metres (30 yards) from the Chelsea goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then shoved the ball in the direction of the forward goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) and fell into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible," Starridge explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touching the ball, and, without thinking much, spear."
Chelsea were in the lead at half-time with a 1-0 lead after the Belgian star Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before turning to the middle of the field and throwing as fast as possible to the side of the Liverpool field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>s quickly played and received the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful shot between the players, allowing Azardam to get into the zone.
Azards overtook the defense at speed and finished the combination by striking with his left foot the forward pole net past Liverpool's Alison Becker (Alisson Becker).
"Liverpool" Champions League group stage on Wednesday, at 15.00 "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will compete with "Napoli".
"Chelsea" and "Videoton" will meet in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the mines of buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high waves, the agency's representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho (Suto Purgroho) told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of arresting a woman
The murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old victim with piercing wounds was found at 7:55 a.m., Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called for people in the area to report who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was in the vicinity of John's Street in Birkenhead to contact us and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in their car video recorder materials, to contact us, as it is possible that they have important information for our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and, as reported by the police, they are involved in informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson, tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are informed that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the whole neighborhood was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the crime.
She keeps repeating, "It's so awful!".
Two in the afternoon inside the cordon were two police vans, and another was parked right next to the outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC by September 30, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 calling 247.
Cromwell statue in parliament becomes the latest "rewrite of history" scandal
The abandonment of it would be ethically justified in the light of Taliban-like activities, which resulted in his fanatical Puritan followers demolishing so many monuments of English culture and religion.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "attempted to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell figure outside of Westminster would also become the target.
Cromwell himself neither commanded nor carried out the demolition of the statues during the wars of the English citizens.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who had lived centuries before.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft reflects a 19th-century view and is part of the historiography of a person many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwell - perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today - saw Parliament as a defender of external pressure, which in his case, of course, was a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue on whether this is indeed a perfectly accurate depiction of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality representing one of the parties to the divorce at the time.
Her achievements as a protector of the Lord are worthy of praise and mention."
Swine-murderer to the death of a farmer in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed in the south-western Chinese pig market.
The man — only his surname Yuan is mentioned — was found dead with a twisted artery, all in the same blood at the pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in Xining (China) province of Qinghai on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had arrived on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his nephew found a man dead and discovered that the pig's buttocks next door were standing open.
He said there was a big man in the pig's lap with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, the forensic medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (<0x7E>249 kg) of heavy weight had broken the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and crippled," said the cousin — only his surname Wu (Wu) is mentioned, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at around 4.40am to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John did not belong to him or to his nephew.
The market manager informed Evening News that the road was turned on to prevent its attacks on others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to information, Yuan’s family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
While such cases are rare, other swine attacks on humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man suffering critical injuries.
10 years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295 kg) pig in Wales held a farmer on a tractor until his wife was frightened by the animal.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "pistol shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to sneeze, they are very curious ... she does not want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
Conclusion of Hurricane Rose brings a broad and strong case to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it crosses the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will bring flood-causing rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (after North American Eastern Time), the rosy wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 mph), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 mph) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure inlet is forming above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards towards the U.S. East Coast. A pink with tropical storm force approaching the Lower California (Baja California) peninsula, on Monday it will start moving the moisture mass deep from the tropical strip to the north.
The pink part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure wetlands, will create a large strong rainfall zone in the southwest in the coming days.
1-4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mudflows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Moisture deep in the tropical belt will result in rain gas reaching 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1-7.6 cm) per hour in some locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In part of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) of rain is expected.
There is a possibility of sudden flooding with a rapid deterioration of the condition due to the dispersion of tropical rainforests.
It is very undesirable to walk in the desert due to the threat of tropical rainforest.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but the winds will bring local frosty winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure approach will bring a local strong case to the southern California coastline.
There are possible rainfall gases, which together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm), and this can cause small sludge flows and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rain shower in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests in Arizona will start approaching late Sunday and early Monday, before rains take over the wider territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday in the Four Corners region (Dr. Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and D.R. New Mexico) and lasts all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the temperature in the Arctic drops, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and San Luis and Demoina (Des Moines), Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, try to form and spread the long-lasting summer heat.
It is expected that in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, the beginning of October will be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit and above (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to the part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday (after Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high probability that in the first half of October temperatures in the eastern part of the US will exceed averages.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the case of Bret Caveno
More than 20 million people watched with enthusiasm on six television channels Thursday, as evidenced by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment in their 20s.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts to report on the latest developments on Friday: the arrangement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate charges for weeks.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno had been kidnapped in her drinking and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kaveno relentlessly testified that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people watched it all on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded average viewer interest.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this was not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually has problems with counting people watching what's going on in the offices.
To get a better idea, this amount of viewers corresponds to the number of viewers of the exclusion games or the "Oscar" ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have resolutely supported Kaveno's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million in all-day hearings, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleik was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican team published a statement that he would vote for Caveno, the senator was spotted on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he, accompanied by a shout of outrage from the protesters, tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
On CNN, he stood for several minutes with his eyes pierced, as if blinded.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "you have power while so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement and, before the elevator door closed, informed him that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
The cable networks and broadcasters were broadcast live several hours later as the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote on the nomination of Kaveno for a vote in the Senate.
But Fleik said he would only do so if he knew the FIB would look into the charges brought against the candidates next week, which have been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleiku was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with K<0xC5><0xAB>nsa and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
The choice of Flieak was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FIB to investigate the charges brought against Kaveno (Kavanaugh).
British Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of Brexit at political games
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and ruining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with her newspaper front page, Meyss's former foreign minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain's future relationship with the European Union, using a so-called "checker plan" to point out that the EU is using a "checker plan" to introduce
Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Diteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Diteon Simpson (Dyteon Simpson) was arrested and arrested as a second-degree murder suspect, Baton Rouge Police Department reported.
Officials released a video showing Sims clashing with Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police informed that he had confessed to the shooting of Wayd.
According to the lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security money.
A team of forensic experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish court on Friday issued a provisional finding that the death was caused by a gunshot to the head that struck the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Operational Group, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation resulting in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the territory's law enforcement for their "integrity and work in the name of justice".
Simss was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (<0x7E>1.98 m) long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in the LSU.
In the last season in one game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Way's death.
"That's what a man is always worried about," said Way.
Volcano sweeps ashes across Mexico
The ash that rises from the Pocatepec volcano has reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The Centre observed repeated squeaking and tremors.
Images on social networks showed that the windshield of cars in the vicinity of Mexico, for example, Hochimilco (Xochimilco), is covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed a 45-mile (72-kilometer) south-east of the capital’s current volcano, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence-supporting protesters clashed with law enforcement and when thousands joined anti-government demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote to secede.
A group of masked secessionists, hindered by the police, laid eggs on them and spilled powdered paint, forming dark dust clouds on the streets, which would normally be crowded with tourists.
Disagreements arose later that day, and the policemen used stings to remove the stings.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters chanting: "Don't forget and don't forgive!" were involved in a confrontation with unity-supporting protesters chanting: "Long live Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance because of minor injuries received during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great tension.
Voters spoke out strongly about independence, although the voter turnout was low, and those who were against the separation mostly boycotted the vote.
According to a Catalan official, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and brutal clashes erupted.
The independence groups were on their way on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcissus Termez (Narcissus Termes), a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer hopes for Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia’s independence won the regional elections last year with a small but significant majority, these parties have struggled to maintain the lead this year, as several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated to the United States or have been arrested and detained.
42-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, who filmed the protests on the phone, said the conflict was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of Catalonia's nine leaders, Uriol Junqueras, who has been in custody until the court last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidacy for the European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has brought against us," he said.
Londondery: Men Arrested After Interfering With A Car In A Building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after a car was repeatedly hit against a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reported that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It is possible that the car was shot at the same time from the crossbow.
Menga's shot allows "Livingston" to win 1-0 "Rangers"
Dolly Menga's first goal was a win for Livingston
Supported by Livingston, Rangers was stunned, giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dollie Menga's blow proved decisive, as the team of Gary Holt equalized the situation with Hibernian.
The Gerard team did not win the guests in this championship season, and next Sunday they have to deal with the leader "Hearts", from which they are behind by eight points.
Before that, in the European League on Thursday "Rangers" hosted Vienna "Rapid".
In the meantime, Livingston has extended its series without losses in the division to six games, and head coach Holt has still not felt the taste of defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingston" does not take advantage of the opportunity against deaf guests
Holt's team with their direct game, which made Rangers difficult in a variety of ways, had to be in charge long before they got the word.
Scott Robinson (Scott Robinson) breaks out, but delays his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow (Alan Lithgow) tries to slip into his legs to stop the Craig Halkett (Craig Halkett) from hitting his head over the goal line.
The hosts allowed the "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that is exactly how the decisive gate came in.
Rangers allowed the freeway, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to provide the opportunity for Mengam, who pitched and got the gate from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests turned out to be impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) forced Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's agility, and Litgovs missed the goal in the Livingston combination.
In the Livingston area, centered balls continued to appear, but two calls for a penalty – after Halket’s fight for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for hand play – were rejected.
Performance of "Phenomenal" "Livingston" — analysis
Scotland's BBC Alsdair Lamont in "Tony Macaroni" arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, constantly improving performance.
The style and personality of their game has practically not changed since returning to the highest echelon, but Holt has earned great praise for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at maintaining first-class organized protection, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always vigilant.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Jared’s authority, they were far from those standards.
Their last ball was dull — only once they broke into the owner’s yard — and that’s basically a wake-up call to Rangers in the middle of the table.
What is the best way to get rid of the disease?
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police, as a security reason, blocked a large crowd of 25,000 people, not allowing them to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also made their attitude known, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take him to their side.
The mutual protests on both sides reflect the contradictions created by the guests, some of whom are regarded as heroes by German Turks, while others are despised as autocrats.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in a car collision
In a collision with a car in London, a cyclist died.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road with heavy traffic in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the help was provided by a doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Sunday collision. At that time, the driver left the scene.
The police department of the capital announced that the police are engaged in identifying the man and informing their relatives.
At the site of the event, roads are closed and buses are diverted, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff were injured in riots in a male-rigged prison.
Disorders erupted at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire at around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent disorder involving eight detainees who are confined in one wing, the staff of the Tornado Special Service were involved
Employees were treated with mild facial trauma at the site of the event.
A prison service representative said: "Specially trained prison personnel were involved in solving the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not settle for violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend more time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October of last year, employees in charge of dump control were sent to prison to solve the serious turmoil in which staff had been attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden flooding (possibly the affected areas will benefit from the drought)
Arizona rarely suffers from a tropical depression, but this is likely to be the case early next week, when Hurricane Rosa will move with the remaining force across the deserted southwest, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods Monday and Tuesday for the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southeastern part of California, and for the southeastern part of the state of Utah, including the Phoenix, and the Phoenix.
It is expected that Rosa will move directly across the Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the case late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (320 km) of Phoenix!
Catrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in individual locations.
Other desert areas of the Southwest, including the central part of the Clinch Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54-5.08 cm) in some places, reaching as much as 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm).
For those who are not exposed to the risk of sudden floods, Pink rain can become a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding raises very serious concerns, some of the rainfall is likely to come in handy as the Southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least an extreme drought, which is the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa Road leads to the Lower California (Baja California) peninsula of Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Pink still with hurricane force on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, lies about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km).
The storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore fades away.
Therefore, it is expected that a hurricane with the force of a tropical storm will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rainforest part of Mexico, there may be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from the southwestern part of Lake California, Sonora, with precipitation likely reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reported weather.com.
Pink will head north across Mexico like a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head across Arizona and land in the south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat expected from the Rose or its debris is very strong rainfall in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the deserted southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that this rain will cause sudden floods and mudflows in the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas that are dangerous to life.
Midsommer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with piercing wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton city on Saturday at around 4:00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police reported that a 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested at night in the Redstock area, Eivona and Somerset.
Police have called for anyone who might have access to mobile phone material to report what happened to them.
Trump says Kaveno suffers from "evil and anger" from the Democratic Party
"The vote on Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump stressed that Mr. Caveno has suffered from the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christiane Blasey Ford several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of the hearing about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw" Kaveno "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history in the service of the people," he said in a statement to the crowd in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the nomination around, talking about the importance of Republican activity in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I didn't run, but I actually ran," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats had undertaken a mission of "protesting and resisting".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior aide of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away as giant waves hit the coast after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday at the festival in the city of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered for a holiday on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves hit the shore in a chair, washing many to death and ruining everything that was in their way.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-ball earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people crawled into trees to save themselves and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs taken in the flight of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water-enclosed mosque.
Afternoon in the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquakes exceeded the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima about 200 times during World War II.
The location of the city long, narrow bay at the end may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho's damage was described as "widespread" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
"The communications were completely disrupted, no information was received from Dongal," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to the disaster-hit regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been even worse," the organization said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning announcement.
In a video posted on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is desperately calling people on the bottom of the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, rinsing buildings and machines.
The news agency Reuters was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was genuine.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which blocked the communication of Palu, hindering officials' attempts to coordinate rescue.
Officials said the army had started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed much food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr Doseba (Doseba) said that the World Vision staff, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongala (Donggala) and now lie in the shed of a tarpaulin in the yard of the office, had passed the scenes of destruction en route.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been demolished," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when the aid groups have decided to organise aid for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and staff of overseas organisations will only be allowed if the affected area is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government announces, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been established."
When Palu arrived the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the still-undiscovered people’s friends and family continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that make life brighter darker during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman, who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paraglider team, had prepared two of the unannounced missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place this month in Indonesia.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi (Mondays), were their pupils.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "it teaches me the burden of emotion."
Mr Gendona recalled that after the paraglider team spread the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages for hours to Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages didn't reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves kidnap $26,750 at the Newport on the Levee ATM
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who filled a cash machine at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was prepared to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "approached the Brink's employee from behind" and stole the bag with the money for the ATM.
According to a press release, witnesses noticed several suspects leaving the scene of the crime, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje Vests: the rapper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
Announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature previously known as Kanji West."
41-year-old West has been called Je for some time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June, ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell that he replaces the singer Ariana Grandi in the show, who stopped the work of "emotional causes".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by the "Ye", which is the reflection of the good and the bad in us, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, has announced that he prefers the words Love and Brother.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with West, either has or has not used a thought mark and capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody student repayment approaches.
Lopes Obrador on Saturday, "Tlatelolco Plaza" vowed "never use an army to oppress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration of the army units was shot dead, killing even 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans in their youth, giving out grants to students every month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various U.S. government bodies made announcements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become the leading country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Twice the budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and the next cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence will take place in the United States.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New Order of the World") this month in "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", is the executive director of "Sinovation Ventures" who is the only one to invest funds
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon (Carnegie-Melon) University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America's best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was the president of Microsoft Research and a Google affiliate in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas.
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"Not China is already enticing leading scientists, but big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university glimmers to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lee explained that China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a single artificial intelligence center, which is designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the U.S. Department of Defense’s Central Research and Development Organization) announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
On the other hand, the National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Northern Macedonia", taking a step that will prevent decades of disputes with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, stresses that the name of its northern neighbour indicates claims to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist that the changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Giorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign with the call to boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by concluding an agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization such as the EU and NATO bid
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, enough MEPs have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, a 2/3 majority will be needed in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no violations have been reported until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, his wife Zorika (Zorica) and their son Dusko (Dushko) cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a small stage and arranged chairs at the tents that had been erected by those who boycotted the referendums.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to step in with our heads up, not through the door of servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a small country, but we have self-respect.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs says NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" "will confirm our future".
In a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, it is clear that the referendum will be attended by 30 to 43 percent of the voters – less than the necessary activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters plan to participate in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote for it.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter activity must have 50 percent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchester's "City" Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) slammed through the entire "Brighton" defense to gain the gate
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling (Raheem Sterling) defended Brighton by allowing Manchester City to win 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Agvero had the impression that his goal win in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker received a touchdown in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He jumped between the three Brighton guards, and threw himself into the open field.
Then Agvero wrapped four green shirts.
He led the ball to one defender, then the race surpassed several more on the edge of the "Brighton" field.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English midfielder used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put in the case the right football boot to beat the "Brigton" goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked with him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he got the gate at the time.
However, it was Sterling who provided Sky Blues with the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agvero in the playoffs received the ball deep in the territory of "Brighton".
He sent the ball with a beautiful shot along Leroy Sane's left leg.
Sane made several shots until he entrusted Sterling with bringing the ball to the farthest goalpost.
The attacker of the "Sky Blues" center easily landed the ball in the net just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with the "Hoffenheim" Champions League group games on Tuesday at 12.55 pm on Tuesday at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinshain, Germany.
Chercer wants to provide problems "Rockies"
Since the Nationals do not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart yet.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to race, hopes to take the opportunity on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies will have the current shutdown games. And the Rockies in the National League of the West are led by one game against the Los Angeles Doggers.
The Rockies have pressed at least a white card with Friday night with a 5:2 victory for the Nationals, but have not yet won their first title in the division.
“Although we’re playing the same game, we’ll at least have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the worst I’m going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but are reportedly ready to let Cherry take the shot.
Sherzer, for whom it will be the start of the 34th, held a throwing session on Thursday in the "bullpen" part of the outdoors, and will throw the ball on Sunday during the usual resting time.
The Washington Labroc is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikes for 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is organising a rally in West Virginia.
The President mentioned around the situation in which his chosen candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Caveno, entered, while talking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November is in jeopardy.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It’s really very, very serious — I didn’t run, but I did run, and that’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats that is taking action right now.
And they are committed to regaining power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, contrary action.
They don't care what they're hurting, who they have to violate to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken the mission of "protesting and resisting".
"And you yourself have seen it in the last four days," he stressed, calling Democrats "angry, evil, random and untrue."
He named the Senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dianne Feinstein, for whom the audience responded with loud shouts.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you flown the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait — that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerable to the open
It was no wonder that the "Momentum" activists in my local party wanted to censor me.
After all, I am the last member of the Labour Party to be informed that he is not desirable – all because we do not hide our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was similar because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic responsibility, of national security, of Europe – ironically, but these were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement on the Labour meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the mood is different and the promises of a "better, gentler" policy have long since been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues who I think our political views are similar began to wait for me to turn 180 degrees and accept the views that I would never have agreed to in any other case, whether it was in the EU or not.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a social media tyranny calling for a ban on running in the next elections, unmasking the centre's policy, saying that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a daily stream of sexist and racist insults, but never try to avoid being obedient.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of opinion and with every expression of distrust or change in the selection rules, the party is narrowing.
In the last two years, I have often been given advice, asking not to jump on the stairs, think about what I am talking about, and then with me "everything will be fine".
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil, in response to the negligence of the Te<0xC4><0x8D>ere government, which had literally led to the collapse of my integrated school class, I set out the task of fighting for better public services in the government of those who are most in need.
I have never concealed my political views, not even my previous elections.
No one in the east of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I would disagree with the existing government.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Brexit, which will be detrimental to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend such time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
However, in essence, the only thing I want to announce is intended not for Nottingham's "Momentum", but for my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of being denied to you or any reminder that you will not be able to see me in politics.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unnamed "Ayr" reaches the top rows in the table
The last two attempts may have to a certain extent shaken the final result, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" has deserved to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unspoken team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent protection and the much better use of opportunities that drove the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all of our games and we're still not beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect to Ayr, they used their opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Freisier Climo put forward "Ayr", but the yellow card was given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been awarded a "Warriors" number, and was changed to "Melson's".
Klimo increased the leadership of "Ayr" with a penalty, just at the end of the half-time, he gained points, then realized a solo attempt, so "Ayr" went on a break with 17-5.
However, Melrose's half started with a good game, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, which Begot made, reduced the lag to 5 points.
Then came a long break, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported away from the field to the pitch, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly advanced, when Stafford McDowell (Stafford McDowall, McDowall) made the move.
Ayr's current captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an excess player — with an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the hosts collided, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for capturing Klimo without a ball from the penalty corridor, McPherson performed a tachdown at the back of the Ayr Pier.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the very start after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's spike on the pitch and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth try of the owner.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
Comedy series "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business, as it turned out that he is named as a licensed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he creates and in which he participates with his old partner in the comedy Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kirnan is apparently planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of "Adriftmorn Limited".
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source said Kirnans planned to be involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, trapped on land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol around the fleet staff in Lapa.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based vessels from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are carved with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile's bloody 19th-century conflict over the lost coastline of resources is still alive, as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are likely to be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in spirit and, of course, with positive thoughts is waiting for the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after several decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile has a duty to confer on the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic local president Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's ruling.
"We are close to reclaiming the Pacific Ocean," he exclaimed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if accepted, major changes are not to be expected.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to allocate territory to Chile, and its representatives have expressed that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed six months after the final hearing shows that the case was "not complicated", explained international law expert Paz Zarate from Chile.
And in the last four years, the case of Bolivia has not moved forward, but, on the contrary, delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has been raised by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales’ military rhetoric has stifled Chileans’ remaining goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue the negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to hold the debate.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, disagreed with the court's unusually rapid decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to the 139-year-long conflicts that will benefit both sides," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the problems of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to ask what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Jong Ho, said his people would never be the first to liquidate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the meetings of the two leaders in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume stalled diplomatic measures to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it's "fantasy" to hope that the U.S. still does not lift sanctions and its reluctance to declare the end of the Korean War will ever get North Korea to take to the streets.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenyana really wants to give up armaments, which the state probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare Kim's next meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest massive headgear line on the way to you nearest High Street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced viewers to a series of absurd, huge headwear items in the 2019 spring/summer season collection that blushed against the backdrop of Paris Fashion Week.
Excitingly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to the fashion show.
Valentine’s Day’s most outstanding work was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with feather-like wide edges that abrade the heads.
The massive accessories included watermelon, a magic hat, and even pineapple—but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed off a strange selection of masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had embroidered lips, and they were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than to high fashion.
One of the formations resembled a breathing apparatus for diving, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of dried ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Style observers believe that huge owls are likely on their way to your nearest High Street.
Large-sized hats immediately became popular after the "La Bomba" appeared - straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Very impractical hats as a cult item’s status on all social networks led to yet another large version on the tongue — the straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model who wore it.
The reddish-yellow raffia bag, finished with raffia berets and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" Spring/Summer 2019 collection of Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags will appear in the central shopping streets next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the grace of the demand."
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for outstanding educational institutions, and it has maintained it in 2018, when excellent exam results were obtained again, further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art in music and other social events.
With a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), this school aims to provide the best possible level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set themselves the goal of preparing their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it stays in his heart."
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Taking into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of passing exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
Data from the Scottish Independent Schools Council on 74 schools show that 72 percent of students received the highest grade in A Chinese, and 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French, and 63 percent who learned Spanish, also received the highest grade in A Chinese.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an elective subject, are now valued as high in independent school programs as subjects from the science-technology-engineering-science and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) group.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for their inability to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
With an increase in job opportunities where language skills will be required, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, when learning a foreign language, they will gain a real advantage in the future, which is provided by such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of multilingual learners.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep the conversation going, but only 15 percent spoke French in a double-digit population.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Multilingualism, especially the language skills of developing countries, will give children a better chance at meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the UK's future, as planned by 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At present, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il must bien le fare (This must be done).
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebrons in debuts "Lakers" in the composition of Sunday in San Diego
Fans are finally waiting for the moment when LeBron's first game in Los Angeles "Lakes" will take place.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's pre-season opening game against Denver's Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still necessary to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton told the Lakers official website.
Mike Trudell, the Lakers reporter, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
While continuing this week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six-game series.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
The time of the Trump residence in West Virginia, channel YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Willing, West Virginia, launches a series of myths.
This is the first of five meetings planned by Trump next week, including a stopover in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump’s goal is to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after the November vote.
When will Trump’s abode in West Virginia take place today and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump’s residence in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o’clock in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump House in West Virginia online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is expected to speak about this week’s hearing in Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno’s case, which has been strained by allegations of sex crimes, and a Senate vote is expected to postpone the confirmation for a week until the FBI investigates.
However, the main purpose of this abode is to help improve the situation for Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign shows that the task of next week's five meetings is "to activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control of his agenda is so important that the president will visit as many states as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," a Trump campaigner who declined to reveal his name told Reuters.
The event, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be featured in Pittsburgh's media," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrison that the president has to come in to help improve his poll results," said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. has demonstrated its determination to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions "in one word" in the format of Wednesday afternoon game "foursome" it was possible exactly what was needed for this Raider Cup.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and they really believe that, especially in competitions like this.
So which side do they think is lucky now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now they are in the lead with four, because I think that in some ways it means that success has turned to us," Jordan Spieth said in a statement.
Europe, of course, has a preference because it is in the lead with 4 points, but another 12 will be played.
Spit explained that the Americans believe that the wind is blowing in their sails and they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
The skit has been destructive from the first hit to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those gutular victories became louder and louder as his round continued, a decisive blow was made in the hole to achieve the same number of blows four times when he and Thomas had bounced back by two blows in two.
His punch in the hole, which reached his victory 15 , was perceived by a similar call, from them, for his confidence that the American team had not yet been expelled.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," Spits said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to get lucky.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spits and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly be in the history of this Raider Cup.
The European odd but attractive couple is behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Mollywood was the only couple to go without a god on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine on Friday morning.
This event and the way their energy flows to this frantic crowd and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Flutwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can ensure a potential European victory when the sun shines over "Le Golf National".
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, the talk of European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quick to cope with this morning's hero in the "fourballs" format Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
God and the two doubles in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes to the chess, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
But there is no one who will help to cope with Sunday.
The formats of the game "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch in close proximity due to the interaction of couples, watching what advice they give and what not, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and before the last day is far in the lead, but this competition in the "foursome" format showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
The European team in the last day of the Raider Cup is in the lead 10-6
The European team of the Raider Cup will start on the last day in a pleasant lead after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" matches ended in the lead with 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the pair were led by two victories over hard-working Tiger Woods, which increased Le Golf National's score to four.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, to keep the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning fourballs format, and the series result became 3-1.
The United States fought more vigorously in the "foursomes" format, winning two games, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
The team of Jim Furyk needs 8 points in Sunday 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European to score four points in a row with Molinari, named Molliwood after a sensational week-end is only the second pair in Raider Cup history to score four points in the first four games.
In the "fourballs" format of the celebrated Woods and Patrick Reed, they then easily beat the tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in the bright game with an even more sensitive score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, sometimes showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes formats, plus seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the fourballs in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson's foursomes to take the first place in 2&1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Europe was not able to achieve its full potential, although the day in the south-west of Paris was pleasant and there was a gentle breeze.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They pressed 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and later returned to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after they had lost their first game.
Only twice in the history of the Raider Cup has the team played 4 points deficit in singles, but, as the owners, the team of Farika (Furyk) is only enough with an inseparable result to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, it looks like Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea announced that it would not disarm unilaterally without confidence in "never"
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States and that, in such a situation, North Korea would not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant steps of goodwill” in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, non-nuclear testing, and nuclear testing.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean pretensions about Washington's opposition to the "gradual" approach to denuclearization, under which Korea will be compensated for gradual steps taken, his statement left an impression as it did not automatically precede the rejection of the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a meeting between the US president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to achieve "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to do so.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also failed to comply with the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that 'denuclearization must take precedence' and raises the level of sanctions pressure to achieve the goal by force, even by opposing the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on the road is an empty fantasy that people who don't know anything about us loathe.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not speak of his intentions for Kim's second meeting with Trump, which the U.S. leader had specifically mentioned when speaking at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister highlighted three Kim meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side of this denuclearization issue were South Korea, and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have occurred."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from what he said last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that firing of North Korea's missiles on the U.S. mainland is inevitable after the "Bad President" Mr. Trump had named Kim the "Bad President" himself.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously, without making mistakes, until a final and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions since 2006 in an effort to ensure that the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes is exhausted.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly meetings and then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea accused him of "walker-worthy demands".
North Korea's joint meeting with Moon this month pledged to dismantle the weapons depot and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University will learn the subject of learning how to get enough rest
A new subject of study at Harvard University this year has gotten students to sleep more, and it’s an attempt to address the increasingly popular culture of brutalism that includes caffeine-filled study through the night.
One teacher found that students of the world’s best universities often lack even basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
The inspiration to create a new subject of study for him came after speaking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and asked, 'Why do you only tell me this now that I'm in my last class?'
She revealed that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep was — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the subject is presented, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in teaching and sports, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the University's health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the study week.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is an image of the dormitories, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and how important a bedtime routine is.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health," Professor Cheisler added.
He said that a culture that prides itself on being able to learn all night long still exists, and added that modern technology and the growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep turns the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So (Raymond So), a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop the subject of study after attending one of the professor’s lectures last year, Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of study has opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student community.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive postgraduate education to master a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students install an alarm clock not only for the time when they wake up, but also when they go to sleep, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the rhythms of the day and night.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's gate overruns Gerard's men
Rangers played another sad game when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's confused team decided 1-0 to lose to Livingston).
The Ibrox team had hoped to win their first away win since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team gave Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became the club's manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish Premier League.
Menga kicked the ball into the goal seven minutes before halftime, and the lack of Rangers inspiration did not look like anything after trying to level the score.
"Rangers" falls to the sixth place, while "Livingston" steps to the third, and only "Hibernian" surpasses it in terms of goal difference.
And Rangers can have another problem, because the assistant judge Kalum Spence needed medical help because of a head injury, which was apparently caused by the object thrown from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left Ayr behind, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players at Livingston who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained team beat opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the ball more often, but Livingston used better what was their action.
They were supposed to get the goal two minutes after the start when Menga's first game sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the centre-back misses his big chance.
The long-distance goal of Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to pass the ball only far beyond the rear pole.
Rangers took control, but there was the impression that the play in the last third is expected, not believed, that it will happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly believed that he should have taken a penalty shot in the 15th minute, after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) dismissed the Colombian.
Rangers made only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not particularly interfere, neither the headshot of Lassana Coulibaly, nor the modest attack of Ovie Ejagum.
While it is possible that what started in the 34th minute of Livingston would have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already deserved it for their efforts.
"Rangers" again did not cope with the long combination planned by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Menga for a simple finish.
During the break, Kulibali was replaced by Raine Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately managed to block the ball from his line.
However, Livingston continued to make guests play as they liked, with Litgow and Halket making one long shot after another.
Holt's team would have been able to continue the lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgoves made a headshot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton asked for another penalty shot in the late game after colliding with Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born John William "Hans" Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, as a result, after all, there was a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, who took his place and remained in science, has also taken his place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which the main roles were played by externally inconclusive cowboys of the type:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the action of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of these minerals."
Evans: "Actually, it really sucks!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named in his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells
When using this method, immune system cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
Then they will be able to "see" a protein that is characteristic of many malignant tumors and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of malignant tumours.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining cells from the patient's immune system by transforming them into a laboratory so that they can "see" a multi-tumor HER2 protein and then inject these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, reported Professor Jay Berzofsky: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "contributes to the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectum cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach, when the patient acquires immune cells that have been "taught" how to attack the cells of malignant tumors, has affected one type of leukemia.
Kanje Vests after visiting SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked the critics of Trump.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was cast in the studio Saturday Night Live during the show after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
Finished the third song that night, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to brush up on loud phrases about Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate Judiciary Committee on the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford in a sex appeal.
Although it was not broadcast, material with Vest's pity was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rox tried to make West laugh in this way.
And West also complained to the audience that they had mistreated him behind the scenes because of his headgear.
"They laughed at me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head!"
They made me laugh!
And yet they said that I had lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Vest went on to say, "You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to put on "your own Superman's camp", because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try to love!”
Variety reported that her comments sparked the whistle of viewers at least twice, but the members of the show's team looked overwhelmed, and at least one person told the press release: "The studio was completely silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago from a friend of rapper Max Miller.
Many were impressed by the song (I Love it), which he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
West was backed by conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most powerful people in the world: THANK YOU, DON'T COME TO YOU!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is, and that's great."
"However, I choose not to reward a person (buying his music or clothing, or supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, supports and brushes with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become a "being previously known as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts just like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the troubled music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "a stage artist who was formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder for colliding in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten at a restaurant in Belfast's east on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kits Heringtons turns against toxic masculinity
Kit Herington is known as swordsman John Snow in the cruel medieval fantasy series "Games of Thrones" by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he thought there was a “problem” and asked how to cope with the toxic masculinity of the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that this problem is important to him.
"At the moment, I cannot help but think about what mistakes we have made with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach young men about this aspect of the problem when they grow up taking into account the existing problem?"
Kitt believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He went on to say, “Who is the one who is born, and who is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be such to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any sequel to "Game of Thrones" or a sequel, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are troubled".
Starting in November, Kitts will play the lead role in the revamped Sam Shepard's "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife on this show because it somehow provided my current family and my life from then on," he said.
The Pink Emmy award-winning fantasy series was played by John Snow's beloved Igriti, a character from Kita.
The couple divorced in June 2018, owned by Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China said that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Around 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which indicates changes.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials informed at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year on year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked Republican senators' data, sharply addresses "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the US House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied allegations that her staff member had published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislature pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were spread by the "ultra-right" wing and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Voters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information is reported to include the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a hearing in the Senate panel on the Supreme Court-appointed Bret Caveno’s accusations of sexual misconduct.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had questioned Caveno.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the records was associated with the Voters office, and revealed information about the Voters staff member, Hills reported.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely untrue and completely false!" insisted Waters.
“An employee of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to this fraudulent and false allegation is in no way responsible for the leakage of information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely untrue and completely false!"
Voters' statement soon sparked criticism online, including criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fletcher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, this person should not be angry.
He can't be a soldier.
He must not comment on the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and calm."
Fleißer's task was to compare Watters's reaction to the fall of Democrat Justice Caveno, who was accused of overreacting during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro (Omar Navarro), a Republican candidate who is running to get Waters to lose his seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Excellent, if it corresponds to the truth," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet had alerted the responsible officials and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Angles 3" review - Rovan Atkinson's parody of spy movies left in half page
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in every new film with a British touch, and this seems to also apply to this one, which has revived the Johnny English-promoting adventure comedy franchise, which began in the year 2011 with "Johnnie the Pooh" and "Johnnie the Pooh" in 2003.
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation, a fatal cleansing of ourselves, of how obviously hopeless we are?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Angle, with his chosen eyes and his unusually moving face, has the right to create rubbish after the second resuscitation — his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad-spectrum comical character designed for areas where consumers don’t talk.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for enchanting sophistication, is a little claus, a little Mr. Bean, and a little bit of a guy who plays a single note in the "Chariots of Fire" in the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left chaos on his way.
In the latest Johnny English adventure there are at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Angle goes on a helicopter suit in a medieval armor suit, and the propeller blades splatter against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's gift of visually creating a comical impression is well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "Impossible Mission" themselves confidently use comedy as one of the compositions.
Humor makes the impression that it’s more about children than adults, and I don’t think the absurd looks of Johnny Angle are as creative and focused as Atkinson’s mummy movie tricks in Bina’s skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that the UK has become a serious mess.
A cyber-hacker breaks into the UK’s super-secret web of spies, uncovering all the identities of the UK agents in this area, as a disliked active agent — the unfortunate little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, the pompoen and the art of conflict, who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing what she can with a character that is partly like Theresa May, but in the script there is not much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform that, since all active spies have become public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the unassuming Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because English offers to learn to explain the profession from the very foundations.
Anglis is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is joined by his former accomplice Bo, who also plays Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to an underwater commander, a fun character who becomes important only at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin make a huge mistake while serving in the secret service of Her Highness have returned and meet Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko) portrayed by the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers are dangerously recruited by charismatic tech billionaire Jason Volta, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer chess.
Anglis and Bo begin their wild odyssey of fun: disguised as officers, they ignite a fine French restaurant; they create a commotion by sneaking into the luxury yacht of Volta; and Anglis causes absolute chaos by trying to use virtual reality on the display of the interpose of Vol.
Everything is done for the ending, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has many elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants to give the workers the savings saved with the help of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes that it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that fits the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not currently support these cravings.
The Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to give a snag to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr MacDonald explained that he was committed to depriving the "mass of directors" and the "speculators" of public service companies of power.
The shadow cabinet minister's plan also means that the average stockholders in the water companies are unlikely to recover their entire package, because the Labour government could implement the "deduction" due to the injustices committed.
He also approved plans to include employees on company boards and create exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into the Cavendish case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley questioned Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could discover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy left a more outspoken impression of the man than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, addressing the hearing procedure, I said that I had spoken to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unequivocal."
However, the vote of the Grema is obviously stone-walled.
"I have made a decision on Bret Caveno, and a devastating indictment will be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her namesake was able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's going to be any change."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday in New York there will be a World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to alleviate poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great Barrier Reef of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson's, for the rapper Kardi B (Cardi B) and for the rapper Shawn Mendes.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert attendees had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, making a phone call or some other business.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or just another case of so-called "cliqueism" when people seem to really be able to influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various goals.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities for which at least US$10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition” — a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their fullest”, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million in pledges to help end the country’s underserved diet after more than 4700.
"With the UK government, donors, governments of other countries, and world citizens like you, we can leave incomplete nutrition in the history of social injustice," Tracey Ullman, the representative of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at her April 2018 London concert.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5,000 measures were launched, calling on the UK government to provide better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It's going to be a long and long road where we're going to stumble and fail for a while.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-partisan movements before us have done, we too will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York City event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness, and Hughes.
U.S. could use military fleet to "block" to curb Russian energy exports — says interior minister
"If necessary, Washington can use its navy to stop Russia's energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East," Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially where it operates as part of the legitimate government’s call, are a prelude to exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe - in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its navy, can make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot introduce its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke appealed to an audience who had come to attend an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation between Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are in fact the same.
"The economic possibility of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy is mainly dependent on fossil fuels.
There are claims that the Trump administration promotes the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia – a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rik Peri.
The US has expressed its negative position against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she is seriously considering running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
"It's time for Washington to have women who will 'save' the incomplete government, which also means female presidents," she said in The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the U.S. presidential election."
During the meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warena has openly criticized Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Bret Caveno.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "Of course, a FIB investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren supporters do not believe that she should run for office in the 2020 election.
According to the results of the Boston Globe poll of the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said that a senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey revealed that the former governor Devals Patrick received more support, receiving 38 percent for the candidacy in the elections and 48 percent against.
Also in connection with the possible candidacy in the 2020 election, high-profile Democratic Party officials such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The Associated Press reported that Baidens has committed to making a formal decision by January.
Sarah Peilin quotes Trek Peilin at Donald Trump's PTSD
Trek Peilin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to Cardiones in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, I can attribute to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and the degree of vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," she told the audience at Donald Trump's home in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She called her arrest an "obvious problem that everyone seems to have been blinded by" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back hard, they come back hard, they're all suspicious of whether or not the pilots are being respected, they're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are.
According to Dena Benet, a spokesman for the Vasil police department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and holding a gun while in a state of vagueness.
18 states, District of Columbia poses a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum-seekers fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday in Washington submitted a brief presentation to the court counsellor to support asylum seekers who have encountered the obstacles created by the said policy, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit launched by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the son of a violent gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of national, federal and international laws."
"The federal law provides that all applications for asylum are examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court adviser said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his presentation that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country harms the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appealed to immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang-busy acts.
"Accommodation is available to persons who leave their homeland due to persecution or fears related to their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political views," Sessons said in his June 11 statement regarding the policy.
Asylum has never been designed to address all the problems, even the serious ones, that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, the number of fallen survivors doubling in the search process
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, reassuring her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"For a minute, the emergency medical services are bringing in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The inhabitants were visible, returning to their destroyed homes and traversing the lost property in the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had suffered from the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harry (Dwi Harry), who had a broken back and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of the inhospitable strong aftermath.
His eyes burst with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I seem to have been crushed in the cracks of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, assuming that his family had come to the city for the purpose of the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then the silence came.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Attempted Intimidation Using Propaganda Ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper came out with a four-page advertisement, highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade on a daily basis, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily paid appendix in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, but China denies it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters news agency, namely that it was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the midst of an escalating trade war, as a result of which they impose a series of tariffs on each other’s imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s repressive tariffs were aimed at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Aiowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion for the Sunday edition of the "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubled this intimidation by putting propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using to its advantage the tradition of free speech and free press that is so important to America by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk, you will find a limited amount of divergent views and you will not see the true reflection of such divergent views that the Chinese people may have in connection with the disturbing economic trajectory of the Chinese party," he wrote in a statement on the occasion of his visit to China.
He alleged that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans who deprive female voters of the medium-term elections in which the Caveno scandal is involved
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been raised, analysts have warned that they will experience a negative reaction to the upcoming mid-term elections, in particular from
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give up their voices.
Such things cannot be reversed, "as reported in the newspaper The Hill on Saturday by Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell School of Politics.
Rieher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute call for an FBI investigation will be a big enough reason to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday. They won't forget it either tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hall sang demonstratively "November is Coming!" when the Republicans, under the auspices of the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue with the nomination of Caveno despite the nomination of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (Dr. Christine Blasey Ford).
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rotenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, it's true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among the fluctuating voters living in the suburbs and younger voters (aged 18 to 29) who often do not go to elections even if the president does not like them."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she made allegations of sexual violence on the part of a candidate for the Supreme Court office, analysts mention the possible failure if the Republicans continued to nominate this candidacy.
"It's become a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they've treated him," Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are a little divided on what to believe according to Ford and Caveno's testimonies, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say certain or mostly inclined to believe Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said that Caveno may or may not have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FIB is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, following the encouragement of Flieak.
Last week, Ford testified on the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno had been sexually assaulted at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that during her studies in Jeila in the 1980s, a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice showed her his genitals at a party.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Acquire Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open source platform "Solid" by Kinders-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Childers-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intent was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses "Solid" technology so that people can build their own "personal online data store" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company refers to it as "personal data-driven powers".
According to John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates Bärnerss-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some outside developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Childers-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, completely reversing all their business models over the course of one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In an article published by Medium on Saturday, Childers-Lee said that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Childers-Lee transformed the Internet, creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berner-Lee has had an influential opinion in the discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Childers-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," said Childers-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Victorian Cross awarded to the clergy during World War I
For 100 years in his hometown, the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
The Honourable Colonel Bernard Wens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he also did not know about the highest British military award.
At a Saturday parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Wens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the very thick fog and the large fires caused by guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firing line and with the utmost sincerity led this line forward before capturing the cannon zone, where three groupings took place.
Colonel Venu was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vens, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, and that at the same time is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also performed with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wens said he felt "honoured to be part of this show" and that "the true value of the hero is demonstrated by the support of many people".
MMA fans waited all night for "Bellator 206" but instead waited for Pigeon Pepe
Imagine spending up all night to see "Bellator 206", but in the end you are denied the viewing of this main event.
The Sanchez poster included 13 fights, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised by the change of the broadcast to Pip Pip.
Some were in a real misunderstanding when they had stayed awake all night until dawn, waiting for the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the change of broadcast to a children's cartoon as a "failed joke".
"The government has determined that after 6 a.m. this type of content is not acceptable, so the switch to a children's programme took place," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication.
"Shit Pep," "yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would work on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
"When we think about retransmission, I think we can sort it out," said Cocker.
"But the clock there is six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until the Sunday after our time and the Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the transmission switched, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problem.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to delight the fans, but we overreacted.
This is an unfortunate situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley did not feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
Visiting the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs" run by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The long-term program's permanent manager Kirsty Young has gone on vacation for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast from society in Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up felt "less valuable" than others, because "it is not accepted in society that both girls and boys can be liked."
He said: "To this day, the feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driver that has given me the strength and endurance to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" to keep people from disappointing when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-level leader of the LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, urging even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without difficulties, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man in the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised the unprepared."
He married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, and claimed that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympics was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who would have experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"The first year all that was important to me was to get a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life about the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not want to accept his death, and one of the last things he asked Dale was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that she wouldn't be in the front row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming of all my life — diving in front of a housewife at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small’s performed “Proud”, which resonated with him on his way to the Olympic Games and still sculpted a goosebump.
The program "Desert Island Discs" is heard by BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 am after British summer time.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in a relationship with someone who’s been in a relationship with me.
The American Phil Mickelson (Phil Mickelson) will set a record Sunday by playing his 47th Raider Cup draw, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
Mikelson, who has participated for the 12th time in the biennial championship, was seated by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's reservist bench for four-ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has so often been the case with U.S. teams, the five-time winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game in the hope of correcting what is oppressing him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the height of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tight fight at the Le Golf National's uneven pitch, where inaccurate shots are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Mikelson will fight in Sunday's ninth match against the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with his newcomer Tommy Fleetwood (Tommy Fleetwood).
If the Americans who are behind by four points, starting 12 single-game matches, succeed in leading, Mikelson's game could prove to be of decisive importance.
Forriks expressed his confidence in his teammate without words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, leaned on my back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furiks said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and also this week.
I don’t think I could have imagined playing him in two games.
I was imagining more, but it all came together the way it came together, and we're going to count on that.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
Mikelson will hand over the record of Nick Faldo for the most played matches in the Raider Cup match on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider Cup fight career, which never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has won 18 wins, suffered 20 losses and seven indistinguishable games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic and smart, he likes to get excited about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the youngest players also liked to play with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a significant advance in leadership can quickly be blown away.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raider Cup in the final singles of the day can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Denmark made its debut at the 1997 Valderrama Games, where a team of opponents, captained by Seve Ballesteros, took a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were in the lead in Valderrama; we were in the lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a slight preponderance," said Bjorn (pictured) in the lead at both the 2018-6 release of the Golf Day of Both Times.
Thus, history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give up everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the points are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and we will also focus on it.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of who’s on the other side, the world’s best players.”
Relieving on what performance his players showed on the golf course, Bjorn hinted: "I was never happy about the early hours.
There will be new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual games are planned, and that's a completely different thing.
It’s great if you have a partner next to you when things go well, but your golfer’s skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you have to pass on to your players, that is, that they in the game of the next day give themselves everything.
Now you leave your partner and he has to go show his best performance as well."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, Captain Jim Furick will see his players show their best performance directly in individual games rather than partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points.
Furick himself has been on both sides of these important final-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later suffering a defeat when European teams gained sensational success, which later became known in the golf world as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, brought his players together for the final day of the match.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d want to get right into the fast-paced show you’ve seen in Brooklyn, you’ve seen in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a great deal of pressure in relation to medium-sized games.
We accordingly created our composition and arranged the guys in a way that we thought was right. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack, and he included Rory McIlroy in the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tomiou Poulterwood, and Poulterwood.
"I'm putting the guys in this order because I think it's the best match for the tournament," Bjorn said of the selected singles.
Delayed commissioning of Germany's new warship
The latest frigate from the German Navy had to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War warships, but it will not happen until at least next year due to the erroneous system and rising costs, it reported local media.
The commissioning of the Baden-Württemberg Fregatte-class flagship Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the unpleasant after-supply problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in late 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods, where new frigates must be able to be deployed up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technological warships that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries will be obsolete by the time it enters into service, notes Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 last year was visible in all headlines when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this move, but the German media mentioned a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship invalid if it were used in a combat mission.
The lack of software was a particularly important factor, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, which is only half of the senior Bremen-class frigate staff.
It also turned out that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to make improvements in the future.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
Its cost is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the German naval forces are declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the navy is indeed "starting to miss usable ships".
The official claimed that over time this problem has significantly diminished as old ships are taken out of service, but new ones are not delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had joined the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
The new study, which is being carried out in a highland property in Scotland, is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in the process of finding food.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help them in future protection measures.
Scientists of the Scottish National Trust will explore pundor squirrels, pygmy squirrels, as well as brown squirrels and water squirrels in Inverness Gardens in Westeros.
In the main places, special recorders will be placed in the property, which will track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all the recordings to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species perform the specific actions.
A map of habitats and a report will then be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape reflecting the behavior of bats.
NTS nature conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland development and how best to conserve forest bats and other related species.
During the last century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works that affect the loss of bat hides and habitats.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain building materials chemical treatment products, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a complex support-location method to detect insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, checks of bat hiders and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve of "Threave" specially designed for bats in Scotland, owned in Damfr<0xC3><0xAD>s and Gaul, where eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland are housed.
Property manager David Thompson argues that this area is ideal for bats. . . .
"This is a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a suitable habitat in general.
But there are still a lot of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stresses that it is important to check that bats do not reside in the site before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as it may happen that up to 400 females and their young are killed by the unintentional destruction of one female shelter, thus possibly destroying the entire population.
Wings are protected animals and must not be killed, moistened, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, has called on the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for several of their species we just don't know what they're doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charge by sending lawyers to sue a German magazine in court
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the accusations against him as "fake news," claiming that people "want to pay attention to themselves" in his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these allegations.
A football star of Portuguese origin and Turin's "Juventus" is accused of raping American Catherine Majorga (Kathryn Mayorga) in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid a woman $375,000 to silence her about the incident, she told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after these claims were made, Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via Instagram’s online video, calling this information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine," added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel magazine for allegations they have made that they have called "unacceptable reporting on suspicion in the area of underlying privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel class in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clarence County Court of Nevada, it is reported that after dating at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he anally raped the woman.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell off the road and said he was "99 percent 'good guy'" but fell into this "one percent" temptation.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this happened after mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman argues that she no longer wishes to accept the terms of this settlement, as the incident left a lasting trauma.
When the allegations were made, Ronaldo threatened to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer, for 100 million euros, he moved to Italy's Juventus.
Brexit: UK 'forever regrets' loss of automakers
"The UK will 'forever regret it' if, after Brexit, it loses its position as world leader in car manufacturing," said Greg Clark, the UK's business secretary.
They are "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily halt production near Derby's existing Burnaston plant.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that a delay at the border in the case of Brexit without an agreement could put jobs at stake.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about the withdrawal from the EU without a contract and how the cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit, it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month.
According to the automakers, the main concern is the endangered supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "watch-in-time" basis, where parts of custom-made cars arrive every 37 minutes from both the UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions on the border that could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not have been able to retain more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) developed by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best deal that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof of this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say for how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris (Peter Tsouvallaris), who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as a union reunification coordinator, said that his members are increasingly worried: "From experience I can say that once a position disappears, it does not return."
A government representative said: "Esam has submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, reports the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court Justice candidate Bret Caveno continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Counsel Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates interference in Russia’s elections, the links between Trump’s funds and Russia, as well as the president’s possible disregard for the rule of law.
For months, Washington has been debating whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney general and thus endanger Miller's independence.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein had discussed recording talks with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, where there were rumors of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said he "would rather" not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which witnessed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused her of committing sexual misconduct — Dr. Kriste.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FIB to conduct a week-long investigation into Kaveno's accusations, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another week, taking into account all the cases that are going on around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press informed about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not related to dislike of television reporters' "love of fame", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are love of fame."
Afterwards, she suggested direct contact between Trump, as a result of which the interest of the press would increase.
"The president engages in more question and answer sessions than any president before him," she asserted and, without providing further details, hinted: "We are interested in the number of them."
Sanders said the briefings would still take place, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States directly, it is certainly better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you see that we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it's going to happen instead of press briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences that are attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason for this this week in New York, devoting an uncontrollable and sometimes strange expression to the crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS about the fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has signed off on EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express gratitude and wish endurance after Brexit.
The MSP sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal continued during the summer, which led to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to underline once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our cared for patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Kristen Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation
The defender of Tennessee's "Tiger" Christian Abercrombie was undergoing an emergency operation after a head injury, which he received on Saturday, in which he conceded "Vanderbilt Commodores" with a score of 31-27.
The head coach of the Tennessee state team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the trauma was not long before half an hour ago.
"He came to the side line and said it collapsed," said Reed.
While Abercrombie was on the sidelines, the trainers and medical staff fed him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that for the time being "there is no information about the type/severity of the trauma", and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out at what point the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after the replacement of the Illionis against the Tennessee State team.

Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds raised will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralise Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased national duty will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The National Fund foresees that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million may be collected per year for assistance to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and diverting the additional funds obtained to provide assistance to the homeless, it will announce today Theresa May.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract new voters by promising to secure housing at more affordable prices and by addressing the wealthier part of society.
The increased state tax will be applied to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money raised by the government in its efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current state fee, including the application of the higher level fee introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home and for the purpose of leasing, could be as high as three percent.
The national treasury expects this step to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many rich territories of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was unveiled just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the state tax so more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land but not using it, and urged Ms Meys to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to address the UK housing problem.
Mr Corbin has proposed a number of attractive housing reforms, including the reform of rent control and the removal of housing for no reason.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new housing.
Ms Meys said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore the British dream that every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means arranging the housing market for us.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought equally easily as foreign companies and persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, its hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of owning a home has gone too far, and the problem of the homeless in the harsh climate is still relevant."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, claims that his greatest goal is to become the head of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, has taken up the challenge of restoring the Northeastern club, which currently holds the third place in the first league with three points from the top.
Tonight he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren's lead back in Scotland's premiere last season.
"As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was all," Ross told the Scottish BBC broadcaster Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland games at Hampden Park with my father, and it has always invited me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in running the club."
Rosa's predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sem Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guss Poul Poijet, and Dius Poet.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims not to have been alarmed by following in the footsteps of such a large club's recognized leader, previously rejecting offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be judged on whether I will be able to return this club to the premiere.
This is because of the structure and the possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits in the Premier League," he said.
"Returning the club to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will probably think that I will be here only when this task is done."
Ross is only a third year in his managerial career, previously serving as a deputy director at Dumbarton and spending a 15-month term with Hearts coaches.
Then he helped the Alloa club recover from the drop to the third level and in the same season helped St Mirren to win the championship.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable at the moment than during his playing career at clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"There were probably real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for "Alloa".
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange because I had a good success, I was able to live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of the work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive and now I do. It seems like I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the most appropriate time for enjoying the pint is at 17.30 on Saturday evening
The summer heat wave has caused the UK’s less popular bars to crumble, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The combined data revealed that in July, the sales of bars and bars had increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the CGA, which compiled the data, said: "Continuously sunny weather and England's prolonged participation in the World Cup event meant that in July, there was a 2 percent increase in the rest of the world, i.e. in June8.
Restaurants, whose revenues fell by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in the drinks bars and bars was the most appreciative, as they experienced much higher ups and downs than the restaurants experienced downs.
Food-based taverns also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant staff felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the monthly consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent, while the food consumption decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM Recreation and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather and the impact of a wide range of social or sporting events are the major factors that determine turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for the continued additional cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers, the long and hot summer could not have come at an inappropriate time, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we usually experience in August will provide much-needed breathing."
Total sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including among start-ups, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decline in brand sales.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the UK’s sales supervisor for bars, bars and restaurants, compiles and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is the industry’s built-in criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from their parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake profiles on Instagram’s photo-sharing site is growing rapidly.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students mentioned that they have a "clean main" account to show to parents, and private accounts are also required.
A mother who turned to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Managers Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's frightening that so many teens create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilida Doila will be a "lightweight voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
At the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors of Eilidh Doyle, she was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as director without executive power.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning indoor and outdoor sportsman, and President Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"The Isle of Man is highly respected throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community, and we are confident that the Scottish athletes will gain tremendously from their involvement on the board," said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a 'lightweight voice' and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus earning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "On this day a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell whether and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I can already do fitness exercises!
Thank you for inspiring words!"
Opinions are shared on a breast milk pump advertisement that compares mothers with cows
The breast pumping company has taken care of shared opinions online in connection with an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the release of the so-called "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company "Elvie" is releasing an ad for a sticky note to demonstrate the freedom that the new breastfeeding mothers are given by the new pump.
Four real mothers dance with a wall-filled cow's snout at a song whose words sound roughly like this: "Yes, I'm snatching myself, but you don't see a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not carnivores, they're my breasts".
The blessing goes on: "Suck it up, suck it up, I'll feed the babies, suck it up, suck it up, I'll wipe my ladies."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page has evoked a wide resonance online.
The video, viewed 77 000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received shared feedback from viewers, and many claim that it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they have to get hard and have to give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump inconspicuously fits breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
In another comment it is stated: "I understand that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that, in her opinion, the song was "exciting".
“I think that’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Milk sucking made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun advertisement for moms who are milking (unusually at work or at the toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who refuse milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely silent, it does not have wires and tubes, and it inconspicuously fits into the breast for breastfeeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarin, “Mother” partner and creative director, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing parallels between the women who pump milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumping, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will carry."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue of Martha Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Town on Texas Border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border is relatively equal to that of the previous month, and this has been partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
As a rule, the majority of sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing that openly claiming to have a child would jeopardize their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would be required to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and this data will also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs law enforcement official, testified before the convention that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these people are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to persecute such persons," Mr Albensa said.
According to the asylum officers, in an effort to speed up the examination of child cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days, as provided for by the previous standard.
Many will take advantage of the videoconference call option rather than coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unsuitable for obtaining release will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are held in detention, the greater the likelihood that they will become uneasy or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to the information provided by the asylum workers and the evidence obtained in the last months.
Lawyers argued that these concerns will intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without spending enough time to prepare them emotionally or to allow them to say goodbye to friends could lead to traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupying armies" to immediately withdraw their forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has already been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegally stationed in Syria on the pretext of combating terrorism, and "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", cleared of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2,000 troops to Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions were excellent for them to return, and blamed the "irrational spread of fear" by "individual Western countries", which is why the refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people politicize what should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for the restoration of the country until an agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the foot of the last dumping ground in Idlib (Idlib) has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualems stressed that the agreement "has deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to draft a Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualems set conditions for the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work would be limited to "revising articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be elected to a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected to the 2020 election unless, and perhaps hoped by many liberal observers, the impeachment and scandal prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic presidency finale of all time!"
At the moment, there is no evidence of observer relaxation.
Since 2014, CNN’s most profitable broadcast ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC’s ratings have almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers at its most favorable time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" ranks highest in the ranking of cable television with 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a fire that attracts many people because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the backbone of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor." In this drama, the drama is told of a cabinet secretary who becomes the president after the attack breaks out.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has his own theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that I would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he's making fun of me,'" said Miss Scowell.
The chaos is, to a certain extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v. Wayd judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it's more than being informed of a citizen when at six o'clock in Daniel's lap, a panel of experts discusses how Bob Woodward will have used unnamed sources for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's "Thirteen Thousands of Dollars of a Kindle" and "Thirteen Dollars of a Kindle."
I, for example, will never catch Super Mario again as before.
"Part of what he does, which gives the impression of a reality show, is that he's flooding you with information every day," Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show Pawn Stars, explained about the changing team of Trump's show.
You can’t afford to miss one episode, or you’ll be left behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss that week, the time on the North Shore was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in the rooms, watching the MSNBC show while recording on CNN.
He couldn't resist, not even when Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court is in danger of collusion.
"I remember the times when we were making all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'They're the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the pre-election campaigns for the most demanding parliamentary midterm elections
It is no wonder that the Pennsylvania 17th Congressional constituency is seeking to receive money thanks to the transformation of the Congressional constituencies, which will result in the two existing deputies fighting for one seat.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburb is linked to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring in another district.
Lembs will fight another existing MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were reworked.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a fight between the main financial groups of the party: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became well-known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely-regarded March 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania election with a slight dominance.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Politicians expect a slight dominance for democrats.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners stood outside the door of the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", its departmental representative Heather Nauerte said in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately 140 million from the United States, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their highest levels.
In the course of the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as a rapprochement effort by the ILO to prevent migrant resettlement.
In mid-September, the country's top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially putting an end to the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend the conference scheduled for mid-October to show how serious the administration is emphasizing the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and serious announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debates that were characterized by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate internally if their anonymity was maintained.
This was confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying History
The second stone in the garden could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a lot of evidence in the public eye.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party wins the upper hand in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this structure, and perhaps also to the jury of his peers, at the very moment when he is already going to meet with the voters again.
There is a lot of 'but', and I am not saying that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to revolt against Hitler, unless the West had resisted and supported him in Munich.
We missed out and missed the opportunity to avoid the years-long intoxication.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has struggled since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his unfitness for office.
Mr Rosenstein argues that the story of The Times is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the FBI investigation just requested about Bret Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And, most importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for the midterm elections?
If we do not endure all these trials, democracy will suffer a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed in all this, based on what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewess who was sent to Auschwitz by exactly the same Nazi regime that once lived in my consignment house.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Sabata candles on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such an inheritance?"

"Rangers" star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the fight with Vienna's "Rapid"
The Rangers will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive undefeated game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League Group G.
Road injury prevented centre striker Graham Dorans from resuming the season with a 2:2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that score as a stepping stone to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing that we would be able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have done them in the end, but the overall outcome is fair.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we were in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was obviously a tough one, but now we see new coolness, which I feel good about.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women are unable to sleep because they are worried about their pension savings
While the survey participants clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed the issue with family members.
About half of the individuals in the national study indicated that they do not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by family members, but they don’t do anything to pronounce it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
Here’s what you should start with.
Talk to a married friend and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known for a long time.
Work with your counselor and family to decide where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for securing long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or collateralizing your assets—the key to having the money.
Develop your own legal documents. Avoid legal disputes even before they have started.
Talk to an authorized health care professional so that you can be a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure the actions of specialists according to your wishes, if you are unable to express them in your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of conferring powers on finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And do not forget the seemingly fine details! Imagine that one of your surviving parents is being taken to the hospital for urgent help.
Will you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you do not prepare.
"And it's not just about finances, it's also about who the doctor is," Martin said.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan has been drawn up."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe (Ilfracombe)
The man received several shots with an air gun, going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was found in Oxford Grove, Devon, at Ilfracombe, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting at around 2.30 a.m. as "accidental".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life, and the police call for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people. The number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to the damaged communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala (Donggala) area, located north of Palu and closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated following a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 379,800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami erupted.
Dongal is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the north-western coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in the area, which is part of the province’s administrative region, in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi Province, particularly in the Dongal area on the coast.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Morowali), on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times over the past 100 years from a tsunami.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of the Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes regularly occur.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populated island, in the south, causing tsunamis to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang (Padang), the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering up to 10 meters high tsunami waves that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A near-Earth earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing damage and panic as it reminded of the destruction brought about by the devastating 2004 earthquakes and tsunamis.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok (Lombok), killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Peilin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peylin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, the crimes that had occurred, he took her phone.
Peilin has been detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and has been given $500 in security money, KTUU reports.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked if he was guilty, he declared that "certainly not guilty".
He has been charged with three Class A offences for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, for which he can be sentenced to a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that charges of criminal offences have been brought against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Peilin.
His mother, Sarah Peilin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
This case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, delaying a report of domestic violence and carrying a weapon in a state of dizziness in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend claims that he hit her with a stick on her face.
In 2016, veterans' groups criticized Sarah Peilin for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder on his return from service in Iraq.
Earthquake caused by tsunami in Indonesia: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused the tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social networks, videos are distributed in which the moment of collision is visible.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the imposition of the rarely used death penalty on a person suspected of a terrorist act in the city of New York
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saifullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist act in the city of New York when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
As is alleged, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists in his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious injury, as stated in a statement about his intention to seek the death penalty, filed in the New York South District Court.
According to the court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
Within weeks of the attack, the federal grand jury accepted an indictment of Saipov's indictment of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in motor vehicle offences, and also counts of non-organized crime cases.
The attack required "substantial planning and prior intention," prosecutors said, noting that Saipova's attack was "particular, ruthless and inhumane."

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since New York's South District Court prosecutors have carried out an indictment in a case that could impose the death penalty.
Accused Kalid Barnes was tried for the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in 1953 in a federal case in New York City by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death after being charged with two years of war in the Soviet Union.
The death penalty for the Rosenberg couple in the electric chair was carried out on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, in the course of days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
As reported by the police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment article, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching an ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested permission to display the flag of ISIS in his chamber.
He has rejected the 22-page indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said he was "pretty naturally dissatisfied" with the indictment.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than accept the admission of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing trauma to all parties involved," Paton explained.
The team of Saipova defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEP announces that Brexit negotiations must be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL FAREZ
During the protest, Naigel Farage promised at a conservative conference today "to mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK's Independent Party said politicians should feel the Eurosceptic anger when one of the MEPs in Theresa May suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, told a march in Birmingham that Britain would have left long ago if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs Meys will face in trying to unite her divided party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who support staying in the EU and joined a separate protest against Brexit organised by the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan on the future relationship between the UK and the European Union (Chequers compromise) and to feel attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
Allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would lead Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr Boun's "Leave Means Leave" at the Solihull mansion announced that he wanted to throw the Meja Plan in the dung (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make the Lord of the Pharisees an ally and to entrust him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we would have already left," Bouns said.
A Member of Parliament from Velingboro (Wellingborough) added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw the Meja Plan in the dirt!"
On the basis of his opposition in the EU, he said: "We did not fight to have services.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country!"
Mr Boun ignored the assumption that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please turn away from the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement to May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians at the home should feel pressured if they are going to disregard the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and our politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let them do it."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd of people, he added: "I want you to let our politicians who plan to hand over Brexit feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and we will never let go until we achieve that we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the pilgrims walked through Birmingham before a two-hour retreat took place in the city centre.
Unknown activists greeted conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group's weekend meeting this week.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers' Party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they experienced with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all of their technology for Canada and more, and more, an undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warena plans to carefully consider running for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" running for president of the United States after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, contests re-elections in November and runs against GOP state Republican Geoff Dyle, who was Trump's vice-president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who will dare to run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the town hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for president.
To which Warren replied that it was time for "Washington to have women who will "repair" the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents."
With regard to the shooting of LSU basketball player Sims has been arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in the case of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Daiteons Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11:00 a.m. at the ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast the video of the shooting, calling for help in the recognition of the video visible to the man.
Sims (20) is shot and killed near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
"The way Sims was shot in the head, as a result of which he died immediately," Police Chief Murphy J. Pole told the press on Saturday, via 247 Sports.
Way manages to defend his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted that he was at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and also admitted that he had shot Way Sims.
The Simpsons was arrested without resistance and he is located in the East Baton Rouge village police station.
6 feet 6 Junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and scoring 2.9 rebounds in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment that Walter Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
From the start, Bottas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two runs and invited Fetela to attack his teammate.
Fethel was the first to enter the garage and leave Hamilton behind to deal with the others, which was probably the decisive factor.
The Mercedes rider filled the circle later and lagged behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to lead the way after a balance of forces, which saw the Ferrari rider relentlessly leave the inside free, risking to lag behind after a double maneuver to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and at the end of the first round was seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race, as he focused on the tyres to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
After all, in round 44 he arrived in the garage, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Valteri did a fantastic job at the end of the week and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one or two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein on Saturday for her reluctance not to release a letter from Christiane Bleisie Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court nominee Bret Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia headquarters, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people there were "evil, indiscriminate and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening during the last days of the Senate, when there is anger when you see angry, evil, random and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and the leaked information, and they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...did you flush the document? — "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn't do it," he added, into the senator's intonation.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July explaining in detail what Ford accused Caveno of, and in early September the contents of the letter were disclosed, but Feinstein denies that it had happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't 'float' her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did too."
But her denial did not please the president, who commented on the situation at Saturday night's rally as follows: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
"They are purposefully tuned to regain power by any means necessary."
Whether you see the evil, the insanity, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwayer scored two goals in Giant's right-hand game against Dundee
Dundee Stars played for the loss suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, winning the Saturday response game with 5:3 Dundee.
"Giant" gained early predominance when the goal was scored by Patrick Dwayer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney led the households ahead of Dwayer's reinstatement of the Giant dominance.
The Frenchman Buhard equalized the result for Dundee before the two words of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the Adam K<0xC4><0xAB>fes guys who won the Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, in which Giants had won the previous three games.
The duo revealed the result of the game in the fourth minute, 3:35 receiving a rebound from Kendall McFaul, assisting David Rutherford to double the result four minutes later.
After the tight start of the game, Sullivan entered the hosts in the game at 13:10 before Mets Markward played for Kovny to get the goal and equalize the score at 15:16.
Two were convinced that "Giant" regained control at the first opportunity when he got his second goal this evening in the first-period sound of the game.
The housekeepers regrouped and Buhards again achieved a leveling result with the goal scored in the 27:37 minute.
Kovny and Charles Korkoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead the Dundee for the first time during the second-period end of the game, and he also confidently gained the goal in the final period to lead his team to victory.
"Giant", who have lost four of the five games, the next game will take place on Friday, where at home will meet "Milton Keynes".
Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to be rescued during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after sacrificing himself in order for a plane with hundreds of passengers to safely take off from the land.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake on Friday rocked the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
In the territory continues strong afternoons and many are trapped in mud in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved his life, 21-year-old Antonius Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was swinging strongly.
He remained in his post to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely lifted into the air.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower, thinking that it might collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Siraits said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he said.
Meanwhile, state authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is likely that the beautiful will grow, because many more people's bodies are still under the rubble, and many are unable to access it," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, reaching a height of 6 meters, destroyed Palu, where massive funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to deliver assistance and the necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, told Sky News: "In just one minute, the emergency medical service introduces new victims.
Clean water is deficient.
Small shops are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and the state's military unit said: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Plane disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini" says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline took a flight that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has been missing, although it previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashed plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that it was unable to answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The public said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The locals helped rescue other passengers and crew by boat after the plane landed in the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The public reported that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the aircraft landed in the lagoon shortly after takeoff from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway was overestimated on the plane.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It was really good," Jane said.
Jane says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane through the emergency exit, because the water was only up to the waist.
He said that the robber panicked and cried, as well as that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's pier also assisted in rescue operations using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane crashed about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG registered airlines in the last twenty years, none of which are related to "Air Niugini".
Psychoanalysis commentator explains the course of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence repeatedly in the case under consideration, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
Paul Rovets, commentator at the Department of Judicial Psychoanalysis, testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information obtained from the phone to compile what 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tell and 19-year-old prisoner Jessica Chambers did on the night of her death.
Rovlet said he had received location data from a number of phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, challenging his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telle was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was "lieing because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted the messages, calls and contact information he received from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Heil.
The defense is expected to deliver its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the trial would be handed over to the jurors later that same day.
Group "The High Breed": What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative views of this music genre, with their music delivering a positive message.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has shifted from its origins to messages of a political nature and those that address problems of a social nature.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced the recent revival of the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after receiving "racist" news
In New York, a babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an erroneous text message from a mother who complained that the babysitter "is black again."
The couple denies being racist by equating the trial to "extortion."
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her rejection when she learned that the new babysitter, Jizel Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NOT NECESSARY AFTER THE BLACK," Plasko-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Mauritius, moreover, twice.
Questioning her awkwardness, Plasko-Flaxman's rebate to Mauritius, indicating that her former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Mauritius was paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Mauritius has now filed a lawsuit against the court demanding compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for work with secure housing, which she initially applied for, including without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that such things don't," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects the accusations that they are racists, claiming that Mauritius' cessation of employment was a sensible decision because they feared that after her insult, she would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her what she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasko, her husband, told the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated harshly, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Plasko said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very "difficult" situation.
"You're really dealing with it this way?
This is not acceptable action," added the investment banker.
While legal proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion is swiftly courting over social networks, depriving them of their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were afraid that readers would not be able to associate with the talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said of the letter: "It's hard to 'put yourself in someone's shoes' who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It is very surprising now to find out what we know about Paddington's great success."
Telling that her father, who worked for the BBC operator before feeling the inspiration to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweet bitter" after the departure of the father
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family", her father quietly prided himself on his eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was created by him and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone.
After landing, her daughter with the speedy took her to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not survive," Ednana-Laperuz said.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying she's going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did, too.
I said, "Well, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even sooner and it was all over now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to master it."
After all, Ednana-Laperuz, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea who she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I nodded my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Complaining Women Attach Cards to Bridges to Prevent Suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are acting to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey reinforce cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
David's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him by his smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted up" always and everywhere."
However, he refused to work before he died because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be consequences."
Davis created cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Humphrey, who has been Davis’s girlfriend for years, lost Mark, her husband, for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he would feel sad or be depressed or feel any quotes," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
His death was a great trauma for the children, but they have to deal with it: "It upsets the whole family.
That's what sets us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bret Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
“I think if we could really get what he’s asking — in a limited investigation of time and scope — we might be able to reach a little consensus,” Fleiks said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the commission would “divide” between the hardened partisans.
Why do Caveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstinence is only a coincidence.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on November 6 — if, as is expected, Republicans go badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a husband from among themselves in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 seats currently belong to the Republicans and 49 to the Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Mike Pensam, the vice president, to decide the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "decreased" the number of asylum seekers in North Korea
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean reunification ministry, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Parks said stricter border controls on North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
No comments have been made by the Pyongyang public.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them forcibly.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when, on big trains, they agreed to work together to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the non-existent progress since the talks.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nenzia Pelosi calls Bret Caveno "hysterical" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nenzia Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno "hysterical" and said he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi gave comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would have called her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Caveno was emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment by Dr. Christine Bleezy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He particularly condemned the democrats in the commission, citing accusations against him of "grotesque and concerted destruction of character" organised by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Caveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the attitude he has towards Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Kaveno if she was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in an existing workplace court,” Pelosi said.
Kaveno is currently a judge in the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about the possibility of Caveno making decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Ways because he is seen as a conservative judge.
In his approval talks, Kaveno raised questions about whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and ambiguous man to work in court, but we would be expected to say happily, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
But women need to hold themselves in their hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "Sometimes I was really helped by a woman, who was the head of a company, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but created a technique — when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sad.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to go.
And I think it's great."
Tears as a type of discharge of anger are recognized only partially, because they are misunderstood in the basics.
One of my brightest memories is from my oldest work, where the proportion of men was expressed, when I once cried because of inexplicable anger, when I was caught by an elderly woman behind my back, a reluctant leader (woman), from whom I always had a little fear, who pulled me on as a
"Never let them see that cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've been transferred.
They think you're upset and they're just gonna be happy that you managed to "run under your skin."
Patrizi Shredder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for President of the United States.
In 1987, when Hart, who was arrested for extramarital affairs, left the ship, also called "making fools" and resigned from the election, Schröder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought out decision," she laughed and told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and the last one they wanted was another one to come up.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She later became involved in the campaign, set back fundraising and promised not to participate in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men’s group, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system that made it very difficult to raise money and to speak out to voters rather than delegates, and angry about the sexism — in which she "came in".
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Shredder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my head.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Beneficial to Beijing
The main pretensions about how the trade war between the US and China is being hidden and while the fight sees no end, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the unit's value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also responds "welcomely" each time, the latest being five to ten percent of $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has said it is committed to responding to the US one-on-one and is doubtful that in the near future the world's second-largest economy could shrink.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it would be necessary to agree to certain requirements, but to publicly bow to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the dependence of the two economies on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are indeed more dangerous than what observers had previously acknowledged," said Abigail Gray, a New American Security researcher who focuses on the issue.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary readmission of refugees and calls for help to restore a country that has been at war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"At present, the situation on land is much more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government shall continue to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
European golf team sensationally wins Raider Cup match in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, surpassing the US team with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by Denmark’s Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the U.S. national team.
If you are a member of the European Parliament or of the Council of the European Union, you are not entitled to vote on the resolution of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union.
Italian golfer Molinari brilliantly played in all his stages, becoming one of four players who have ever managed to get a 5-0-0 result since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the existing format.
The European team lost sensationally with 5 against 4, according to the rating of the lowest-ranking player Torbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Justin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 to Ian Polter from England, who probably had the last Raider Cup.
The eight Raider Cup veteran, Spaniard Serhio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't control tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he has lifted me up and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we have recovered the cup.
This is a team achievement and I am happy to have been able to help," Garcia commented emotionally after the European team victory.
He then gives the name to his compatriot John Ram, who won the U.S. golf legend Taiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"This pride that I felt when I won Tiger Woods, I grew up following in the footsteps of this player," said the 23-year-old Rams.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who has won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being the second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find their own opportunities, except for Patrick Ryde, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's unsatisfactory performance, U.S. team captain Jim Furick said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
Tonight was a time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will be restructured, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raider Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You need to put on your hats.
They won us.”
