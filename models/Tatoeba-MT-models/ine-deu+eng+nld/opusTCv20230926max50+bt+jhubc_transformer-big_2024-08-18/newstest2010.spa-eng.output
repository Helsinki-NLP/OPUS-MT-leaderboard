Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple plans a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, though the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, not forgetting to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which specific organization.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Nature Defender Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association of blackmail Sociedad ochranc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>rody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Sociedad de defensores de la natura Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice).
Last year he repeatedly appealed against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The president of the Society of nature defenders Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like too much containers to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that in Brno garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally lagging behind in the separation of waste, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> square, opposite Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Huse.
Don't get mad at me Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, it is also not easy to separate garbage elsewhere.
That’s why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By vagueness
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Thankfully, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the hockey league from the city, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire region of Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from the income and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness allowances or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness benefits. "That only means deferring problems for the future, it's placing mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or operating expenses of the state, it has to increase taxes.
To everyone he added to the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, their children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year there will be not only 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowance, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed or their price reduced.
The best thing to do is to keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are settled ecological damage, serve to complete the account for the income or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the income.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The money transfer carnival doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were raised from the budget to provide various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, take advantage of the government’s budget reserve.
A hundred million is also still missing for the State Pokladna (State Fund) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the different authorities are spending on.
The first phase begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, at the touch of a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization, and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It is not only the ski lift maintainers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e who are worried about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Spindl.Info portal maintainer Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations should not hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mostly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year's interest in winter stays is impaired by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will run out as well," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We are about five percent better.
For New Year’s Eve and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest rises during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas, half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us as we were at about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as it snows, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for now it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will be left with the desire for snow waiting.
Temperatures should drop on Thursday and, if there is rainfall, it should snow in the mountains.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it turned out to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text used several times the phrase "the same as in Iraq", but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan's Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the chief every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, and patriarchal tribal relations will remain after him.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated because of confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocked by his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "go home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it as an indirect declaration of U.S. defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after it set aside almost $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to levy a one-time, fifty-percent tax on bank bonuses that exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialised categories and literature today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
In the event that there are several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The most traditionally expected Nobel Peace Prize received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the meeting.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved left-wing proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
There was a serious domestic policy conflict between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in the spring by the SDGs, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president believes.
SDG leader Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of a bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong judgments.”
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek. It will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood’s new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to be portrayed in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God's still so many, he is still very powerful.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to outsiders in the world.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that by shaking your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met with Pienaar at his house for the first time.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look a lot taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The missile, type "Bulava", previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the device.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, is likely to have actually been the failed "Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>".
The same Norwegians from the first moment did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile withstood and the failure occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Defense Ministry’s management, only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA of Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will once again introduce himself at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We only have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who manages to raise the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-lived professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one for the entire season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The biggest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. Will cancel all the additional work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared the emergency strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree on another Saturday shift with the unions for this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
According to the Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz server, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. prolong the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vanek said.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement of the emergency strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production was started last November.
As of last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'striked' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
AIDS disease cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and therefore they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus albumin.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A Traitor and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in a sample, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metalocarboranes interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Molecular and Organic Chemistry Institute.
Fights for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget approved for next year is “terrible” and Prime Minister Jan Fischer’s government should, he said, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were cited by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say they leave time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government slammed the SDG proposals as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDGs before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> televise Janota called for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he was thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is their disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees to another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the nominees by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he will resign, whether the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that relate to sickness grants, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in the U.S. text message.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the SDG members.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will take care of it, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Minister of Defense Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDGs.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS ceded at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that the SDGs in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday would probably vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the SDGs to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in the parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevikization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself reacted.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D train schedule, fewer trains will run at almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy (Czech Railways) will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains from December 13 and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates, including the basic and customer price, will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy for this line will add a pendolino highway.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not return to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy is in the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route will also be cancelled and some fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail bill: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, as well as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
For fast trains and local dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always one year.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy are happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only occur on <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Arrest More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several primary school students and their teachers.
According to the AFP news agency, only 65 abductees were reported.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the southern province of Agusan.
They say about 19 armed men use the hostages as a live shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, the martial law was imposed because of the recent killing, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 killing, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the killing they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in American theaters, capturing a portion of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There is great hope, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as is said - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA then won the World Cup.
For getting into the grail in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995, mentioned.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled his country to Britain, told LN in a recent interview.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has seized a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman of the firefighters of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatov<0xC3><0xA1>, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing similar happened, failures of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s spokesperson for the northern Czech Republic, electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire at the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.S. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operated on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for slander to three Hetmans of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will today file a libel complaint against three Social Democratic Hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the region of South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the society Student Agency, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he mentioned having the evidence from all the regions; according to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, that again on this occasion it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and would like to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, what kind of man it is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also already made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, pneumococcal vaccine will be available free of charge to children born since August 2 last year.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate, that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns on vaccines annually.
Uncoupled will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 annually on all of the children’s vaccinations.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country kill 28 children under the age of 10 every year, according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
Compulsory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the Society of Pediatricians Professional Society of Practical Child Physicians Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> recognizes, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect that by next year more than 80 percent of young parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated, that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved "in the robbery of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at 20 million US dollars (12 million pounds) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta's father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means necessary to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta's father denied having granted such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show her seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% ceiling in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Anger for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems."
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE BEFORE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax exemptions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 involved “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60 percent of the additional tax burden would fall on 5 percent of the highest wages.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and outlined spending cuts were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
“These are big numbers, and it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan request would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” dodging difficult options until after the June 2010 elections.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," said shadow Treasury Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals that would seek further deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by the tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the finance minister exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment to public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Treasury minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins, wins,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s economics consultant.
"This has been the fake report before the budget. The markets realize this."
FBI investigates 'American arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, whether in fact these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns 'Iranian abuses'
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the June presidential election.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election result.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said after five days it signed a false confession and released it and left it on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the government’s post-election and response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racing track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see below a beautiful view of the city lights titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for the construction of minarets to be banned and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceptible today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane questions, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to disseminate this argument entirely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions to what extent French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “an adjustment of values.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate landscape in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it the life that can’t survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth by confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The puppies, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one-millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range. The climate is almost never adequate: a Singapore resident polar bear turned green by the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile Eskimo Indians use high-power assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a startling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines plotted a map of the moving ice cords circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tidal system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saltwater that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once summer ice recedes, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington graves
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours on a bus to place a single crown in the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where we're boarding, these could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I’d like someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year by stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military deceased.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the extensive meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t get as many visits as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others leaned to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Navy gunner Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the location of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro's brother as leader of the country, to replace his in Fifer.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who search the Internet for radicalized young people.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not mutated and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaeda is looking at aspiring U.S. recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to have access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about those they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model how many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Demand Climate ‘Action’
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here in the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people attended the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says "enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother’s native country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world’s leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to evade it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that it affects the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence from a Test Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal grade booklet on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best performing systems, the grade book showed fourth and eighth graders jumped at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance difference between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. fourth grade white students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between black and white fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was announced in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week as advances by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the ensemble by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit advocating for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an avid critic of Rhee's administration style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what’s worrying is that we’re not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a kind of scathing dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with self-governing schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a 185-day year, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong rush.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
“Yes, that’s where I’ll be!” exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, she said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduates from college, a notable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to make up for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University Tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Oil Ministry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to lure major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned fields in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants at the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreated, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda’s top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials from the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said a civil intelligence agency official from Pakistan, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "fully demolished bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from the standpoint of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of US airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had strategic guidance from al-Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a well-known name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally from The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN Highest Envoy in Kabul About to Resign
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was marred by widespread corruption allegations in Afghanistan’s UN-backed presidential election.
The Eide exit comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. schedule for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, collaborating with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the charges, but said the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermined his ability to capture talent.
That’s how UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we’ve learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it’s the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that “a package of incentives and disincentives” would be needed “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “their people will suffer enormously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran’s toughening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of Dec. 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including moving forward with what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday's "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council over Iran's nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that preached to them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when officials of the Shanghai government, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously sloppy children, mischievous only children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six since the policy became effective, according to the Division.
Demographics of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labor shortages.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A Gradual Relief
Written in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed further exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Demographic Research Institute at Beijing University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly overnight, posters that ordered families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
While officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launches, more urban districts indicate no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu municipality’s family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to having everyone take care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, hitherto characterized by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document predicting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying the bulk of the burden on their shoulders.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not speak of how much money rich countries would give the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as “the big picture.”
It shows profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. special envoy for climate change Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should be spending to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, jumped off the planes and rushed to the halls of the Bella Center, closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present evening shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, vice president for global conservation policy.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed long-distance train will reach 225 km/h, as it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the shift of planes and cars to the railway would reduce national coal emissions, as well as ease congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is an Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said a railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to support 400-metre-long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would need a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially, trains would be forced to leave fast lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange Tree from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency’s house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that deputies lived “on rations,” increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the applications "couldn't be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange."
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London property to the house in his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was soliciting approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was going to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still requesting <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House opposition president in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.”
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the payroll office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound symbol in Mr Duncan’s lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the payroll office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and criminalizing or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton Beach Palace
Brighton palaces have found a new impetus for the winter months on an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served for free.
The chosen carols so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the calendar of the Advent of the Palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to test and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the protest in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with tiles and hammers, a journalist from AFP reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the venue of the negotiations.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil, and the event was attended by a host of speakers.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with skyscrapers, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue seas” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of demonstrators were formed claiming to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, but Georgia denounces 'fraud'
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Russian-recognized Georgian separatist region.
Electoral tables closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Election Commission of Abkhazia, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central issue of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large plaques show Bagapch next to Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and very particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, responded by lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that is due to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil, and the event was attended by a host of speakers.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, a journalist from AFP reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a tile, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We did not take away the eyes of extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with skyscrapers, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue seas” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
Oxfam, along with former U.N. refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was supposed to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial kick-start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dress and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators called for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography comes reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all high school seniors will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it convenes the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to emphasize even: "Neither did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography in the second grade of high school."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that about seven French out of ten (69%) disapprove of the government’s project to eliminate compulsory secondary history-geography teaching from C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the C secondary school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) convened a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also do real-world internships during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as intern teachers.
If you do all the proposed internships before the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the “Ernest” conference, a day consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from AFP reported.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and conveyed to them the desire to know more, explained at the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the pupils baptized the fish from the pond of the school.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is founded on a very serious scientific record".
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delay in payments: displeasure among prison guards, action is expected
The prison guards unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it calls the failure to pay in December the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October "ashaming and unacceptable".
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization ... in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they say that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellery reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours will not occur again in the future.
December’s pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who benefit from the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who “always blame budget demands,” the Ufap/Unsa lamented.
It is a real scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the moment when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, according to the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not what was expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he’s making “better gifts” than the ones he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famous TV host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: “I make better gifts than I get.”
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year’s holidays at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be out of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you beautiful gifts,” she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, however, I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his associates, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of disc herniation performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that such injuries "needed a reparative operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, interrogated by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital on Monday for an infection stemming from Delajoux’s intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, explained on RTL Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me right before I was traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to get twelve hours on a plane after such an operation, it's not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure him by claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for “colon cancer,” after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been over-reported. Fanatics and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his associates even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title at a distance he feels particularly affection for, 50 m free, during Euro 2009 in a short pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in fact many more were expected.
One was enhanced by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian embossed 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where they competed ten swimmers instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that from January 1 will be banned.
These swimmers, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel owned by French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions in ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, no doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the home of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private mansion, and in the home of Paul Raynaud, minister of the III French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before the Marshal Pétain took over.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborts Zelaya's Departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to move to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied safe conduct.
At the moment, after an evening phone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source at the Directorate General of Migration.
In order to grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “renounce” and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The coup government “suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has been making statements since the start of the political crisis that has been in the country for five months.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an application for asylum, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
“I will not ask for asylum from any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around Brazil’s embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government’s stance.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president, Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to face justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures faithfully witnessing the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent; and the Nasdaq 0.33 percent.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have received good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the medium-full glass".
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, reflecting the growth of major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of the power are bucking the "Damas de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government hustled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of the government of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, a journalist from AFP said.
The Yankees are dying!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!”, the power activists chanted to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes officers who came to “protect” them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the “Damas de Blanco” in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by civilian-dressed police officers, a reporter from AFP reported.
Agents forcibly climbed into the vehicles dissidents who were bullied by supporters of the government, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Dames of White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities assign opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" to pay for their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien murders an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (High of the Seine) on Thursday at the height of the afternoon's influx.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of it in the No. 85 Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
In the aftermath of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was hospitalized “in a state of shock,” a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had escaped through boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unsolved.
He was armed with two butcher knives that were crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd was thrown at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched and wounded, according to police testimony.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I felt a very serious wound in his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Altos del Sena Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was “in a state of overexcitement” as “all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action.”
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dismissal
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director’s lawyer for “The Pianist,” denounced three California Second District Appeals Chamber judges for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel said: “I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “was frightening.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) spoke to a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before issuing a sentence, which constitutes a serious procedural violation.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
At the end of September, Wells declared that he had lied to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument at first instance, that no denial of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before being sentenced for “illegal sexual intercourse” with a child under the age of 13.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
L.A. District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
“With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to [Roman Polanski] but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing,” Asayama said.
For her, the filmmaker "asks a favor from the court, although he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client no longer tolerates being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, and adds, “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad hut, pending an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed Friday aimlessly, in a market that is being debated between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of trades is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve the market’s view of the robustness of economic revival,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, at 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary estimate of the index.
However, the indices were slowed by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads downwards to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportista or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real upheaval.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This event, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5pm (15pm GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of re-discovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World contestants focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown,” said Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee head Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
He’ll probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday 'very positive', says son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, laid-back, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from a herniated disc surgery on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, a photographer from AFP confirmed.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Parque Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on disc herniation, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone cannula-free, with nothing", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed after a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the court on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation “could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage,” he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a bracket.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I think it is very risky, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Procurement) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw his support.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, it was assisted by the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the ownership rights of the brand to them, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements hinting that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it correct to continue using the name of the movement, the + Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, the UDF office explains, demanding that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (its) website."
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to the courts to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "has been a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the abbreviation UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to carry it out on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that you are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, she took advantage of the octogenarian’s state of weakness to expropriate her from a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars from the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter compete over the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court no. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday must submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from states of weakness and during what periods.
I think you'll agree.
“I’m going to talk to her,” Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he walked out of the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to get one billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or artwork.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the origin of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations sometimes resulted in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office once again considered that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give way to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be allowed to appear in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the public prosecutor’s representative.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers would be delivered.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of collaborators adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to the strategies of conquering markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the preferences of customers is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of R&D and, even more, of business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) “requires all parties involved ... to have proactive behavior and forward-looking vision”; this needs commitment on the part of employees that is completely contrary to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the survey conducted by Orange among its employees, incite a managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely disseminated behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage executive engagement “commands”, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms executives in a mechanistic management posture, unsuited to today’s world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business executives can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "on the spot".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: For ‘Just War’ Obama Receives Right Praise
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “just war” against America’s enemies, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s delivery of the award on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party to the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo devoted himself to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some consider a possible candidate for Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear “a left-wing president” when he reminded Nobel Committee members “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current columnist in the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “spoke like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the not-so-convinced right-wing few, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonous, pretentious, and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech “overproduction” especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guiding international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “spoke the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “at the same time somber and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure the Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport et Logistique de France), the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the strike slogan and the threat posed by the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau "joyed" at the deal, following several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators bid farewell at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a doorstep.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the end-of-year parties," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will instruct our militants to stop any further cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable commitment.”
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the holding of road transport general assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million drop in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 finance rectification bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms."
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it as a “naive business” as the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million had “already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, la Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months" at risk.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions not in line with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on RER A, France’s largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., due to one train out of every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that “RATP is striving to provide service to large stores.”
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran in rush hours, and almost no trains in rush hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
Thus, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up "an hour and a half earlier to get on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday, and the results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers who claim a premium owe them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers stormed a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the leadership, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Independents submitted a warning.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 benches in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before being unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision comes after a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe the DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic ties" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP claimed that a dissolution could generate an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators dropped Molotov bombs or rocks with shovels.
In Istanbul, about 100 people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision was going to “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
At all it is something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
On the weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-strips leave with large vehicles with salt, explains Braubuer.
These include, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts around 3 a.m.
They should cover approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That’s why the FES starts around three o’clock in the morning, “thus the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic begins.”
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 am.
“So we have a problem,” says the director of road maintenance in the winter, “because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That’s where the trouble comes in, Brauburger knows it.
Around five o'clock in the morning the EDF infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the EDF would not be able to take charge of all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 pm to 4:30 am does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salty vehicle starts running as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa findae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long, 1.50-metre-high animal running over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with shovel-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, spread, and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the team at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens in total.
A Finding Confirms Theories About the Ancient History of Dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts are debating, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as the "long necked" sauropods, and their kin ornies.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found evidence of airbags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of the posterior giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers conclude that saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages separated at the outset and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a unique land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
In the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of modern crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct on the boundary of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt had repercussions all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike because the walls and artwork were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command."
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of inquiry and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a newscast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, the provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The views of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left are different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret armaments research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenograd representatives have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Narrow Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; in Frankfurt he signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific Exchange (disambiguation)
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate into the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since in the past it took an enormous amount of time to hook the locomotives from back to front.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but this is how it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be started, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals of course also have no further problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transportation of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavs.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-moving route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as it should be.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will file an appeal against the decision on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have tasked experts with the legal investigation of the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwestern runway at Frankfurt airport, the federated state would have to again regulate the prohibition of night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 23:00 and 5:00 a.m., as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a miscalculation.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s accusation that the federal government was still trying to get its night flights through misrepresentations of the law and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group’s claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks will repay the aid they have lent.
The big US banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at once the aid that the bank rescue fund Tarp had lent to it a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a U.S. CNBC report.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The “Bank of America” had obtained approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a few means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source in familiar circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Choice
In the end, everything was faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German TV channel) pressured editorial head Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
Favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially for not anticipating the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would not also be approved on the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the board of directors already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of the prestigious editorial head with the argument that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news outlets would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even interfered in the debate, calling Koch’s course of action unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Romanesque politics, pedagogy and philology.
Afterwards, he worked on the radio station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informational "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 staff reporter of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The Green Party announced a constitutional lawsuit following the dismissal of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch’s opposite on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate government president, explained last week that the federated states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters from the ZDF’s control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the board of directors was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a supporter.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to the liberals of the left.
College Careers Are Cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the race must end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers more flexible.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have been continuously talking about the improvement of being able to successfully complete a career (studyability).
This is the first time that a specific content has been discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
The "sensible reduction of the test load" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined with regard to unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of courses.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and foster self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
Responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Accreditation Council, which is set up by the federated states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now, only Rhineland-Palatinate had provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Federal State and the universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating the accessibility of the Master.
Until the end of next year, it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federated state.
Apart from the praises, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialist) university groups it was demanded that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the university ministers and rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as the main involved should be able to give their opinions as well.
The chair of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demands a legal right for each student with the bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be enough study places for the Master with the best possible study conditions in the future, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about increased access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education made no comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany becomes virtually uncontrollable," says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lectures or poetry talks in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who has not defended himself sufficiently in the face of attempts to provoke the Securitate’s fear,” Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that highlights the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of theIM Walter.
He had excused or defended it in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Securitate-Spitzel spies, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases will have known what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of the files of the control by the Securitate is still rather diffuse.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Enlightenment of the Securitate Records (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records has since been rather traceable.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate in Temesvar spoke derogatory of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so many times when there is silent guilt.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hopeful that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the craving for knowledge and not so much by the acknowledgment of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday, it is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that a elegantly dressed outdoor service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the item maker reparted.
The man with the bald characteristic had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was also not drunk with joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reach the eighth final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “much more important task” awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League finals (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/return matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be played on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy was kept limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had soon inspired the baffled Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had effect.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had been missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also abstained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by a lack of relief and totally outperformed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
Heldt’s reluctance to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his home in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in the management of the board, which had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt remarked, and announced consequences for the latter.
They probably won’t be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the team of the substitute coach, the show of great strength of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Category: World Heavyweight Championship fights
Burning duel in Bern: challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by a unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had been waiting for.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion's blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a “horrible zombie,” who “can’t do anything.”
In the weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, from the United States.
In this fight I received only one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to bring together all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall in November.
Last summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: Greens group leader Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly deceiving the cause.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" newscast, broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had "knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellery, the military and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his fellow Greensman Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery exercised no influence over specific actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, they had also raised doubts about the ministry’s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed delicate details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report by a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, he said.
The ministry did not make a statement on Saturday regarding the accusations, and said this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Category: Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves without hindrance to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be crazy or drug addict, or at least manic.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality.
Alert altered states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the views of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the misuses, formations and élocades".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red slits like blood, deformed, sharking teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Screaming and malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and fixes them on a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump. Jump.
The rope loosens.
What a lesson for you!, shout the voices in a chorus that reverberates the eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of this was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in their lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give commands, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis opens the door to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
In contrast to a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, it is still unknown why our brains make convertibles.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a predisposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmission system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and cranial trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly inhibited; when our brain gets warm, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, bad love or other exceptional brain states.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A regular girl.
If it weren't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a somewhat strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She is awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she’s crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the beaks or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told her anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. Today is20 years old.
He approved selectivity last year and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since she's been in contact with psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., only daughter, was a little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, she learned that the man she’s called dad since she’s been using reason is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends his patients to appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually become pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also entails something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called Oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Dream-conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with an imaginary world of its own that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an incomprehensible situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day trips following a heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he found himself prostrated in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot guarding his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these interior trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so it describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
It’s clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are qualified for it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the board of directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
After Jürgen Todenhöfer left the company, he also took over direct marketing, abroad, printing and finances.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the editorial board.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the 10, 15-year gap," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaefle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who are infected by the craving for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That was never my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything – in terms of beauty and well-being – you can wish for, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where tea is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
As, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also features these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The ‘LIVE Office’ (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motorsport.
This initiative will be developed during the 5th to 7th of February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill Testing Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop – a device that is at least currently only available with the petrol 2.0 engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good grade achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driving seat, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large suitcase with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter 150-horsepower petrol engine and with the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its fineness, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving contained consumption.
Although the Mazda3 will be the most demanded diesel version, those who do not make a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its low fuel consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth.
In addition, if its equipment was small, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers per year will be able to opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 150 horsepower.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tried-and-tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
'Premier' of luxury
L. A. covers the red carpet of sensuality hand Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as she used to be, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and has long had to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated push-ups to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the home country there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it bears the name Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no ties.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a life-long access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If you have already come to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the gathering in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – greenish yellow with bright reflections – the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestauri.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession it was about a thick lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with a print.
The accessories have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected on this occasion, melena loosens the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundidad y trajectoria laboral de las femmes en Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they perform.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, lag behind coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged 35-49 with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after commencing coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed employment have needed longer of their life path to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, albeit less on the timing of mating," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women in getting married and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the greater the age at which they marry and at which they have their first child.
There is also a difference between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at an average of 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
Category: British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poker of Ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty radiographs of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in the foreseeable and fearful genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but seeks something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and re-reading.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against the unfortunate destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of a knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers emerge again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry cast from a bridge by that Munich character to carry its echo to the bottom of the 20th century night in its literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘God, dear, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Dream after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life satiated pleases death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage I also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she would tell him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Saints do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
The Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years old was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilograms of weight and, without intermediation, they kicked the dog two times.
Our indignation is capitalized because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small and helpless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when he rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energist who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock in the afternoon on any Tuesday for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it will serve for a long time and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat a helpless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship for free.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing products that are safer every day," and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheeled vehicles tires, one of its main goals is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increase the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, which is not obstinate, should be quarantined, since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a consequence, despite the rebound of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of the light commercials: derivatives of cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank credits, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Against this backdrop and in contrast to passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been a testament.
Just yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need for special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with ABS anti-lock brakes and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of absence is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, because of its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant that does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piston that the driver gives.
But he doesn’t always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of car components Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants each of the points in the plan to have been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM is making sure a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but is forced to opt for the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
Should there be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and expensive, jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them, first of all, to dispense with the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'in' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gaining 12 kilos more;
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for fabric ones, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California side roads, on mountain stretches with actually inverted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as impeccable.
The weight reduction does not imply that the car does not tread the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much security in the corner passage, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short gait for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and re-squeeze his engine...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine's roar, already previously released in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, well in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag girl"
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodded her pocket face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she is a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses that the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and in this way he is in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples of his score was the best.
The Victorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the Blues, who were put from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it seem that they had jumped to the Israeli court with their hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with cheers and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his resting advantage (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' rating of Splitter already hinted that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on the run to rest, was not decided at all and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elijah' pressing managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Ivanovic's wounded but not the least dead, needed to spin a couple of moves successfully to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), who managed to make up the quarter-finals.
The alaves left their skins in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had the owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost severely in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and neither by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned him over to the score 22-20, 13th minute, at which point an action, contingency of fight, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were burdening the cashiers.
Among the domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the advantage 44-32, 19th minute.
An Impossible Return
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even equalled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership shake.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area proved unstoppable.
Croatian forward Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb the average basketball 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, handing the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to data Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French programmer 31,059 euros gross per year, compared to 24,000 euros received by a Spanish programmer.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by that of a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the web in the last three months are for the driver, the middle-day jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has put in place a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date at the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum that the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on her.
Thank you so much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant focus in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving liquidity bars at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its annual auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and the public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but Standard & Poor's came in and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence advocates of moral risk who were trying to re-create a position of consciousness on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirates to reassemble power in the emirates and Greece has seen it before.
A government that hides the public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin would save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments earlier this year and that it would allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt differentials expand, like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the charge with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not foresee much life expectancy.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as nuclear power plants remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and the power will already have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "support energy".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just passed is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of combating climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term commitment" in this regard, despite the "point-by-point" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, even if they are long-term, should begin to be made already because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Center for Smart Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concessional motorway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Frenchwoman Bouygues and sister Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a constructor and highway dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan protected by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to get the work done and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia with a notable presence of European builders compete.
The group dubbed Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spaniard in Liza, and their partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
The Acciona team is played by the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where share capital the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Bauderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the desalination plant in Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate those two areas and leverage synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The Brisbane Underground Toll Road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is called to link the Western Toowong Highway with the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel traffic. It is the largest performance to reduce congestion.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit to Hochtief, which announced yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
ACS will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, enable the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give the German woman a job for 18 months.
In addition, the company has passed the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still underway and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a Slovenian motorway worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after getting the works of expanding the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Ms. Rushmore Agency for an amount of approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest called by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore recidivist.
Applications Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to earn the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the major revenue streams of major clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this division.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have pocketed the most money to participate, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also made the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
DISTRIBUTION
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses to win (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish language is one of the most important, and has four places assigned.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group unraveled yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for all titles.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for such postponement of 1% annually
Yesterday, the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If implemented, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and the court moves of its former executives, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared at the National Court yesterday and stated that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the opa of exclusion of Paternina that presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opa of exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.

New tools for car repair
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are towed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No damage is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Calculate manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
The providers of services and solutions for damage assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, and then elaborate it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of appraisal and information-processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been released than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes to market, these companies start working.
It is a very arduous task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, from each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "stuck".
If it is a bulky model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If you are a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that professionals in the sector can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard damage assessment solution, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to usage, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of audits, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total damage.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analyses or know the deviations by brands or models.
You can study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious injuries in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical benchmark product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% in the last three years, and in 2008 it generated 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or damaged special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrapers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been lowered cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be unloaded even if they have been unloaded after a frantic process.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears, and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated manpower times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
