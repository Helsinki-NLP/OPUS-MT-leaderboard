Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance comes in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
Sitting at the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, he talks to Czech journalists and is preparing for a game with the Americans and a sharp start to the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
Thibaut Courtois takes the lead in the Premier League for the first time in ten years at the London club.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Czechoslovakia.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in matches with Atlético and did not manage to enter the league season when he lost 2-4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He scored two wins and two draws for the French league, scoring St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
The most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and left Lille 1-1 on the weekend.
On the English boulevard websites today, news surfaced that the Czechs might want to join the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Chech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet put a 4-1 rate on him.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your shirt in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that cannot be rejected.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer, which can't be rejected, actually looks.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position, whether the club dealt with a possible offer or not.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a change when you are in Prague now?
Wouldn’t it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in your new field?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere at the national team meetings and for sure a lot of transfers will still be closed today.
So somehow it would be achievable.
How many clubs are there on the planet that you can afford?
I really don't know.
So you're not pressuring me to leave?
The situation where I didn’t catch a new season in the first three games is new to me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
"I want to continue to participate in this match for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper and it's up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he will make in the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
For me, of course, it is a sporting aspect, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family belong, of course.
Is it possible that you would also catch for another club in England?
That's a question I never thought would concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
In the first place, plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy are on the list.
India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Police in Karrat arrested a 20-year-old boy after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it drove 125 km/h into a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
In the morning in Karrat, the police tried to stop the blue bike by the edge when they noticed that it was 125 km/h on the way out of the pumping station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and proceeded along Burgess Road and then drove into the bush, so the police lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person matching the driver’s description were then spotted in a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police accused the 20-year-old of not obeying the call for a stop and careless procedure.
He will appear in court in Karrat on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will face trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was acquitted during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster claimed to have attacked her, while "she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also charged with raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis drafted a law that was meant to protect union organization as a civil law.
“As trade unions work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able, together with the model of occasional rights by John Lewis, to introduce a law that strengthens the position of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-trade forces.
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join trade unions, stand trial in a civil court – and judge compensation or compensation – is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other proponents of the law are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country in one breath advocated democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja would be replaced by democracy.
They believed that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, incorporated language into them, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that restrict or seek to damage this right will be void. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide treaty, the unions included their proponents and Roosevelt's guarantors in their guaranty that "the
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions — and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner — must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - is lagging behind.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that elevated America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers said would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The ordinance, enacted by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal’s signature in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions, and in the meantime they must obtain this authorization.
"The proposing party will be able to legally operate and in the meantime obtain a permit," Federal Judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion rights welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana will be safe from the insidious law that is meant to deprive them of health and their rights,” Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerns doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs and are also applying for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that passed similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women’s rights to abortion, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this authorization puts on doctors requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions objected to the measures aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only one abortion doctor is licensed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities, in response, said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while they are waiting for an application for rights to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video of her late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
The researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynaecologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvements in remote medical services that have to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study found that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to today’s young generation of consumers reaching the “main age group of gardeners,” garden centers losing up to <0xC2><0xA3>10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55% of the amount that people living in their own gardens.
Another factor threatening the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, is the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking spaces, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over the past six years, one household accounts for the lowest spending on gardening products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society stated that sublet housing or lack of space does not mean that people would not be able to grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's chief gardening adviser, said: "Rentalers are very fond of growing plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, saved me with nuclear weapons and basically showed everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia shows many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled by both the ardent nationalism and the complex of inferiorities can be transformed into imperialist lusts.
Time seems to be different in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars over domination of Europe was long gone, the East on the contrary thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the seizure of Nazi power and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians are probably missing after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part shook before them.
Perhaps it was the fault of the Western politicians themselves, maybe little Vladimir was slapped on the shoulder, maybe he was not invited where he wanted to be and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he simply behaved like a typical Russian male.
He did his homework, pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere, and shredded knives at home.
Now he has decided to take back his lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
He's a leader for life, so he'd be in a hurry.
He trampled the Caucasians, now tramples the Ukrainians, then the Baltic dwarves.
They've been biting the Russian bear's skin for a long time.
This is something that China will surely notice as well, which is jumping out a lot and is definitely making an advance to the Far East.
And those Germans are also pretty good at Vladimir, and I put it on their ass at 45.
How about a new Novorossia in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours, and how they're pressing them and the dacha, they're trying to break down some of them.
After all, our veterans remember until now how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Now vote for their Prime Minister Mr. Sobotka, he is so soft, you can peel like onions and I will eat their whole EU.
That's how it would play, to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And we'll use our comrades who live in their territory as detonators.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they are said to oppress them there, they simply oppress them there, and we will not let them do so, we will protect them.
And the Russians will rule again, for what else is he born for?
After all, Europe is only good as a presentation on which the proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey Calls for U.S. Diplomat Over Espionage Report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states were watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones introduces new 4th-series tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently shooting episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scenes, when a crowd of soldiers becomes a huge army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Complainants on Friday submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall of Calvia to the Mallorcan state prosecutor's office.
The director of police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online Mallorca Diario newspaper, on Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the town hall of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted dissatisfied night-time business owners as saying that the government’s concessions had a serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s not about making money, it’s about survival,” one businessman told the court.
Don't play with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to monitor drunkenness and rioters in the ranks of the participants of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage tour, pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel swimming pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought a frosty surprise to southern Australia, came with heavy rain and strong winds, which seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short showers associated with the storm and gusts of wind, which started before eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early spring doses came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
The storm is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land after 19:30, but for a short distance it was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to land.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at that time reached ground speeds of around 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
Subsequently, the delay caused delays in other flights, including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending their summers in bomb shelters, while during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas, rockets and mortars were used to attack their homes.
The beginning of school brought to the communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but the signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the employees of the kindergarten hit by the rocket have removed from the wall the remains of the shards and are slowly waiting for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a Kibuku Saad resident and English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that "it's a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"We've had a few tough times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which a shot from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in secondary schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding, “We will ensure your education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite peace agreement on Tuesday.
The ceasefire led to the immediate cessation of fighting, but did not solve key problems such as Hamas' demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli military, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have been hiding in a hundred UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who still remain in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope they open the school soon so that we can complete our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
Vrba at the meeting: I stand behind V<0xC3><0xA1>cha.
Lafatu is troubled by the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon in Prague today before Wednesday’s preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
From the twenty-three-man squad, the Spartan striker David Lafata has problems, who is troubled by the temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's going to be two or three days, or if he's going to be fit tomorrow, we'll see what his medical condition is, which our doctor will decide," he said.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in the game on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan midfielder Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> V<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
He admitted that this was not an easy decision, and other midfielders were also considered.
I decided based on the fact that Lukas is a prospective player, who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I am behind it," Vrba told V<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens with Latato.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend with a great performance shined, for example, Liberec Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave a hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
In the event that it will not be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who are interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there will be a performance training at Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA at Letn<0xC3><0xA1>, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The game with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the premiere victory under the Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for 9 September at 20:45.
Pedestrians go to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is glad that, unlike previous meetings, he has more time for training.
It’s an advantage to have players for eight days and to be able to practice certain things with them that we may not have had so much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting ready for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba said.
The Dutch will perform in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by the former temporary national coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He's giving us the information they're from the match.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're going to be filming it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than doubled for one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data figures show that apartment prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising between five and six percent on average.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by state-ordered spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring begins, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“Due to the continued high rate of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with a few unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry underwent "deep" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve just heard his voice: “Stop the rumbling.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a kid, they were already adults — were going to a bar with him and discussing things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a hit in cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
Most of my life he was a serious guy in the corner who reads the papers.
Henry recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always went into the bathtub and just lay there, then it was heard how slowly he began to sing for himself, because he was washing the foundry out of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying to each other, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love that he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying, "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, with whom he had been married for 25 years, is still a good friend.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes began to manifest, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tedious.
No one wants to eat the carrots themselves.
A change in the direction of Henry’s career may be reflected in his elegant, short-sheared chin.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of errors and the plots of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comician on television."
He was studying for a march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to come up with working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually starred in his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer healthy because of it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “for years and years an acclaimed British television main product” was also a “great parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, introducing characters that simultaneously ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For decades, he was stripped of ads, documents, TV shows, and film roles, but after broadcasting his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Lene, it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next in line was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergies to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It was as if it gave me courage.
"That's it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to have ten minutes of fun.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Hmm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry v Plots v Duchess Theatre
Learning the plot text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like a sign from God that says, “This is what you should do.”
Of course, he says it with an outspoken voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the lab.
Henry still has the brains of a comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked if he would ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give the outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registers Officials to Enlighten Non-Existing Employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its government officials to try to remove non-existing employees from the government’s payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer receive pay.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they have left the state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to prevent corruption in state administration.
The audit conducted this year showed that the state comes at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month in salaries of non-existent employees and in further abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries are still being deposited into bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the state administration, a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All government officials must arrive at the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
Furthermore, he says that anyone who does not show up without sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“By appointing real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existing employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish Police Arrested for 'Crackdown' Against Government
Local media reported that a total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "striking against the government."
The police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) called their actions part of the action of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools have traditional ceremonies on September 1st.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, attended by Jacenik's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving teachers flowers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience from the front lines.
She started her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she served as the Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigning when her younger colleague took the top position at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her departure was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former City Council member.
In May, I described the director's job as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things aren’t working.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and thus taking his own job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and how its status is being revised.
As the competitive circuit expands and new technology challenges old assurances, the immediate negotiation of concession fees for the BBC is in great danger.
For a modest <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is clearly on the rise: to 53% of fans compared to 31% ten years ago.
Models of using BBC services have changed: Today, newspaper headlines appear on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she's found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says He Didn't Approve Offensive Tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, released on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a Democratic prosecutor initiating Perry’s criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry’s account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
There was a tweet from my account that was not authorized.
“I don’t agree with the tweet and I downloaded it,” he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the inquiries immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it’s unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet posted a non-smooth, humorous image of Travis County Attorney General Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a drunkenness trial in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption read, “I don’t always drive with three times the blood alcohol level... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable for it.”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
Perry's investigation was not conducted by the Lehmberg office.
It was overseen by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended payment of $7.5 million from the state's public-interest defense fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be finished by tweeting his own photo of him running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal.
One of London’s most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market in southeast England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding clients at Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from its peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.” He adds that it provides a “stable environment for operation.”
The London housing market was doing well during the decline, as buyers from abroad flooded into the capital.
According to the cadastral authority, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far exceeding the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable, and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, London real estate foreign buyers have not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also intimidated the introduction of new property taxes and the talk of possible "settlement taxes" that politicians have come up with ahead of next May's parliamentary elections.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that an April review of the mortgage market, which introduced tighter loan rules, would also slow down the pace of growth in real estate sales and prices over the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has lowered its forecast for London real estate prices for 2015 to 3% based on the fact that house prices have already begun to fall.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington declined by a quarter each year.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it raised forward sales cash to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same, and that kept forward sales going.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenue by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, before Pidgley's annual meeting, he said it was expected that Berkeley's annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker Posts Nude Photos of Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of new actresses.
A spokeswoman for “Hunger Games” confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “obviously violating privacy.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker’s photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing server, reportedly obtained thanks to a gap in Apple’s iCloud internet storage system. BuzzFeed’s alleged list of photos of the hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars including Mary Elizabeths, Kim Kardashian, and Rihanna.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" Winstead on Twitter also criticized the act.
“I hope that those of you who are viewing photos that my husband and I took in private at home years ago are happy with each other,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victory" denied that the photos were real, but said on Twitter: "These are my supposed nude photos are BUSINESS, people."
It's better to put it in your mouth. *intentional word play*.
Buzzfeed on Sunday night announced that pop star Ariana Grande’s spokesman denied the alleged photos were true.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
Dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
It was only from time to time that a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too fierce, too isolated, and perhaps a little sluggish.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it reluctantly.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was a beginning love prank, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild curl of hair and an overflowing heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited the property in a moist but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs slipped into the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, frightening and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held the cheetah in their hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, unpreparedly set up a public station, which supplied the region with comforting music and calming messages, while the long look of his cheetah in the long cheetah looks at his cheetah while he is sober.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they never played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned -- they weren't really banned -- they just weren't playing.
They helped them get to the deuce, as did the word deucetudo itself.
People’s taste has done what regulations and positions outside the law would never have done, and just as people choose memoirs about books in which a poor man becomes rich, cooks and romance novels, so balads are chosen in music.
The cavern was torn down and began to play the imaginary piano, and in a coarse, comical voice sang a serenade to Aillina's big feet.
I don't understand.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
This is what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny then, and it wasn’t funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard anything.
Even jazz, although not directly built outside the law, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one “if” in life.
When she started playing the melody, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
The same in humor.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was humor expressed in songs.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when her favorite singers weren't black.
Also without laws or pressure.
A loose society is one in which each part of it with gratitude—with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately saved—concurs with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution were suitable for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature endowed with electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who stayed were the plumbers, the Greeks who stayed the dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while what happened did not happen, WHEN IT HAPPENED - they were afraid that they would be accused of being put into the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would devour them and the next time the fire would devour them - they would open the fire.
To each according to his talent.
As she listened only to the balads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could come from the filthy words that Cavern was just singing to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really stupid," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said at last.
Unbelievably, she shook her head and overshadowed Kevern's view.
There was nothing seen in the whole wide world except the tingling of her curly hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you mean it," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk at all.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of biased.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe it was a deliberately cruel cavern.
In spite of his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from the couch, dropped the radio and poured undrinkable wine.
No tin wine, so the drink couldn't do it.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm pervertedly attracted to you being an idiot," she said.
Except it doesn't appeal to me.
She felt sorry for him, both for his rude words and for the fear he had in his eyes when she confronted him.
Did you think he'd hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean raged over them.
The same insane men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more impertinent and grumpy than their ancestors, the smugglers and the cashiers, infuriatedly blossomed from pub to pub, ready to extend their hand to any woman who dared to refuse them or to exalt themselves against them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First anointing her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the immature ballads of love that the radio snorted - first anointing her, then killing her.
In Kevern's opinion, too much cultivation, because petting was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally suggested that he leave.
He got out of the bed like an old man.
She felt cold, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave, as if she were watching him from a window on the floor, the man who had been forced to do what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart went out for him and for all the men in general, no matter how many of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, has prepared a short article about the persistence of light and medium-sized acts of violence in the regions of the country, where she has been involved in the most serious of the violence.
"A lot has been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the steep, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the towers of the church, the crowd has only risen from the tops of the ramparts."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the impulses.
The inhabitants sigh over sentimental balads, swallow unfortunate stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality is held as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence is also shown by the hard work of sportsmen and women.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," said her superior.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again asserted her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I don’t ask,” Rabinowitz said at the end, “that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unincorporated companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort the judgment as you have shown.
Obviously, you yourself are preoccupied with the Church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
To continue to address WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, is preparing the country with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board was a pink flash of recommendations that Ofnow has been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
“To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than a written one, but there is nothing better than love.”
"I fully understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, as she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound did not heal as we pretended it had healed.
My concern is, above all, that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz put the fingertips together.
It was meant to be infinite patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps that your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting your “anger” and “infidelity” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"In the midst of which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we are not without fault.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt that can be misled, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But what is the past but to learn from it--
The past exists to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can add--
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, dismissing her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist, who hired her on the sidewalk in a way that the passers-by described as "brutal and furious."
Accidents happen.
Lesotho Army Claims No Coup Plans – Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup to overthrow the government, claiming that they acted against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country, saying the army surrounded its official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family left for the neighboring South African republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm themselves with.
“This morning, the command of the defence units of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several reports from the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police who plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make a trigger in the country,” he said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to topple the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence components are likely to bear the mark of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothejoa Metsing will be in charge of the government.
Thabane said he believed he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliament due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite claims to the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low, according to a closely monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final purchasing managers index in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell in August to 50.7.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders fell and the factories damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the euro area’s remote recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There have been speculations that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to the one that the UK and the US acceded to during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the decelerating effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerns have been raised about France, and Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring,” Dobson said.
The industry’s slowdown is likely to put oil on fire to analysts awaiting the implementation of additional monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight, said, “The best thing to say about the August purchasing managers’ manufacturing overview is that it shows the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the euro area are currently experiencing a very difficult life as rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increasing uncertainty in trade has been demonstrably affected – and above all, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially expensive ones.
He said it was “more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be only limited.”
Ten years of the hell survivors of Beslan: Ten years of horrors from busy school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three days of suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrifying occupation of a school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical terrorist children and parents were captured and murdered on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, it looked like the deepest depths of hell.
Resisting the tragedy brought the East and the West together, leading to action and a future in this disastrous misfortune.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine – and in which children like them are dying – is over.
Girl Trying To Get Back Into Destroyed School Gym
It was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as he tried to get back into the bombed-out school gym in his underwear after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had blood on my feet.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another operation.
There were pieces of scraps in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
Once a year I go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Jerry Gapoev was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the captivity, but the memories get a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the internet as I climb through a school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Flee."
He feared that she was dead, ran away and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child's hand and ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara rushed to freedom and was lying in the hospital with an injured leg and, conversely, thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember throwing all my guns at the game right after that.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and didn't get out.
We'll never say they've been killed or they've died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
On a trip to London I remember well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I rode a convertible.
But now he’s worried about places like Ukraine, where he’s suffering as much as he and his friends have suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a terrible time,” says Damir, who took part in a volunteer activity at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police, and I hope they'll welcome me to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children screaming and running here, and the silence lasted for several months.
He vividly remembers his trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say personally that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and still will be killed.
They are the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people war is just something in the news that they listen to when they get bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, that doesn't interest him at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and he goes to the gym every now and then and light candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes he lay on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he lay there for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing all his guns or other weapons at the game, Damir's 17 today, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: Grigori Ilyin and his mother Fatima from Beslan after the attack in 2004, Grigori today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was a tinge of fear in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the courtyard, so my boy was left alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes harder to think and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass before we remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us to have happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise you, no one will ever forget.
Always returning memories: Grigory's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like looking at the photo, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this image, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this is not repeated.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one ever finds out the truth.
They are now investigating the crash of a Boeing in Ukraine.
Do we ever find out what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years because of a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why, when September 1 is approaching, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiosurgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not going to work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
A boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a miracle he survived.
“It feels like it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've been throwing over my head.
Now I’m older and it’s said that children with bad experiences can cope better – I have to say that’s not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on his laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
When it comes to physical health, I’m fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm already walking normally.
But for health reasons, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me that it was not possible.
My other favorite is animals, so I joined the veterinarian.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know that I will never tell my children about it.
It’s not something that kids should know about and not something they should experience at all.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
She's in there, and it's getting worse with her upcoming anniversary.
I'll be attending the reminiscence ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory's an adult today, but he's carrying on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's already overcome that fear by 50%, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and the pain only worsens.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and it is the greatest gift that God could give me, but it hurts to lose those killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who did not marry again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We used to be one friendly country in the past, so how did we get into fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away... as far as we can go.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is taken to a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she is ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world caught its breath when a Russian police officer took little Alyon out of Beslan custody.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan is remarried and they have a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter, Svetlana.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and has grown out of her a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said, "It's a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.
Man accused of kidnapping a girl on the transition to a sign in the village of Fife
An eighty-seven-year-old man is on trial for hitting a three-year-old girl while crossing the sign in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The plaintiffs claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with enough consideration and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges in court in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair set the date for January.
4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules that apply to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you are taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are only designed for 5 feet, others for 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in a regular and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them will not work.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you with photo composing, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly visible underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure scattering, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper immersion of light, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stick close to the level when taking pictures in the pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you are shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmed light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving patients of the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that mutilated him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and diseases, the overwhelming majority of patients treated are interested in something completely different: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and that his wife Juliet included remorse.
He remarked, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pelvis or lung lining.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fiber material that was formerly called "miracle", but today it is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos is, after all, a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as the treasurers of insulation, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in a different era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we only now feel its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the stores we shop in.
Mesothelioma therefore does not respect social strata, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged gardens, from London’s commercial houses to public schools, are no hiding place.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are stores of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even isolate himself.
He was trying to figure out where he could get in touch with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years practicing,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question that he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been in Guy's Hospital and who have had mesothelioma in the past five years," he said in a 2010 letter, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for such a long time is not usual.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Illness is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get sick with the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pete, a leading British expert on mesothelioma, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them have no idea that they are going to die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A brief look at the archives of the courts, to which the handicapped often turn and require compensation, shows the extent to which the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised the clothing section in two stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children, who are over twenty.
"Before that happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my dreams that I could be involved in any way.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
Its name comes from its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it to be a “great health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (Amosite) and blue asbestos (Crocodile).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos and experts argue that “there is compelling but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
A Marsk & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store on Oxford Street in London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that “a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to the "regular use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not realize that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report claiming that service elevators and pipes outside the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as “strong airflow.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliament's services insisted that the Westminster Palace should receive a "positive medical certificate", the Centre now expects that it will take <0xC2><0xA3>1 million and several years of work for Parliament to be thoroughly examined, the electricity will be modernized and the asbestos will be removed in 2015 by the Centre.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven to be present,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
Of course, he remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was hit by something like a cold.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
All of a sudden, I was shaking.
It came right away.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the bruise, the lining around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, there was no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him an X-ray of his chest and implanted a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had practiced and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between the chest pad and the lung pad.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and the New Year: “They told me it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest itself.
Mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous heat-insulated asbestos tubes in hospitals were located in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients’ lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Bunsen's kahan was built on asbestos pads
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulation and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website was created to deal with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a lot of homes,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s when a garden house collapsed.
So be careful how you break down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while for you to realize it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I was going to have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I can't live next Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of doctor to the position of patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember saying to myself, “Well, I’m not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive — the breathing itself — is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers inhale, they can settle in the cheekbone, the lung pad.
Asbestos fibers irritate the cheekbones and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “sole breathing pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its very nature, it is invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
The treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the nerd," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there will be someone who will survive lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After the discovery of mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you have reached the cancer center."
“It was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably only extend his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Chest Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they searched me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get the application and they would have to approve the payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail, many patients face other financial concerns — about the future of the family they leave behind.
That's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health,” says Morgan.
However, in the 1960s, it was found that even a very small amount of it can pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, this was not a "full-fledged settlement", as Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement area was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Seducing exposure to deadly asbestos to a single company or workplace — usually decades after that — has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
Evidence of insurance is lost.
And those who are now defending themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to consult their former employer.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve that is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, they will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 successful applications are expected to be processed.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “good job.”
“It’s an agreement made by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it hadn’t hit time and people with mesothelioma were able to track down their former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former minister of labour and social affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan both admit that, given the seven deaths each year, rapid action was needed.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott has been in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended the operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott reinforced it.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Check-ups did not show any symptoms of the disease.
I went for another check-up in March [2014].
I had a few spots in my chest [cancer].
My fiftieth birthday is approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
He drinks it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of the tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved of hope or merely an indication of a chance for survival.
The disease brings with it (and ultimately brought to Stephen Jay Gould) unhappiness.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.”
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen cooking pots and increase resistance to heat.

A fabric that is non-flammable was invented.
I saw the napkins made from it, which glowed in the fireplaces at dinner parties
In Italy, asbestos begins to appear in commercial use, it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa, soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent insulation material in steam engines and turbines.
The world’s asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential’s statisticians find that people who work with asbestos have a higher mortality rate and then life insurance is denied to them.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs were “undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros. Asbestos, reject responsibility.
They won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships are being built intensively, and work in shipyards poses the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal upholds the first successful lawsuit for health damages resulting from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
The world’s asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute of Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
In the UK, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
The Mesothelioma Act enters into force in the United Kingdom.
A 350 million-dollar compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
World production is kept at two million tons per year.
China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Power to Choose Leadership – Protesters Promise Revenge
China’s parliament has decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite mounting debates over democratic reform on Sunday.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists have begun organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress is essentially allowing Communist leaders to expel any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were outraged," Democratic Party lawmaker Emily Lau said.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People’s Congress’ Standing Committee, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership elections would cause “chaos.”
Since 1997, when Britain returned the administration of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that people will be able to vote in power starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders have presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly holding the nomination process of a committee that is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Central Occupation movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing gives them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy movement gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks, waves of protests will begin.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Centre only as a last step in the event that all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and no other option remained.
We must announce with regret that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the deployment of the Centre is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, stepping up protection of the government's headquarters and deploying police and barricades on Sunday.
The incitement of unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade – Hong Kong’s lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” says Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could hurt the investment.
China’s state media has also in recent days come up with reports depicting democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
Last summer, activists staged an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Pre-election agitation?
League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
About 1,600 amateur athletes play a small kick in the regional city of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
And their highest competition is renamed Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that runs until the October municipal elections.
The top ten on his candidate is also the boss of a small dig in Jihlava Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
The situation around the first league of small diggers was already dealt with by the lawyers of Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
The small excavation took about a million crowns last year, according to the city’s website.
This year, too, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not in violation of the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and grants," said the spokesman of the mayor Radek Tulis.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as a small kick in the elections of one political party, this is probably no longer possible.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come up for high-income "big" football.
That, for example, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD would be created by the district prebor, ODS division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like to be contacted by sponsors from companies," said Miroslav Vrz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The head of the small football of the other party and the movement in the name of the league will not let
According to the players of the small kicker, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the pitch Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>ch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, about fifty of whom are in Jihlava," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) said that the small dugout uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD> and Na Stoup<0xC3><0xBD>, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that make maximum use of them.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a lot of progress has been made in the last few years for a small kick," Vymazal added.
According to Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka, no other political parties in the league names will appear.
We have limitations.
If someone from one industry enters into a partnership with us, we no longer put the other one there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider that at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldan, a member of the City Council Committee for Sport.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka is using the association Mal<0xC3><0xA1> kopan<0xC3><0xA1> Jihlava and the subsidies of the city for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - first-time students can fly a jet plane
We are pleased to be able to respond to your request by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to make the best impression when you arrive at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important freshman) variants this year, students will arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that given that the services have just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who enter university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting on the train, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists Resist Racism and Police Behavior After Ferguson Events
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
The attendees, waiting for the funeral with their hands up, chant: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz noted a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With increasing tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of the whites was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of the Negroes soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "The White Man's Thoughts on Ferguson" or "Feminism Isn't Just About Suppressing Women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, however, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at this level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis that we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially marginalized that they had to point it out.
According to a professor of English at Ohio State University, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny life stories on Facebook with my partner and get 150 characters from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about color being trapped in my own country, it's silence deafening.
“How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issues of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote — women or blacks.
"They decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and the right for blacks to focus later," Hattery said.
Realizing this, we get an important glimpse of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the rise of white feminists in response to the issues that Ferguson brought - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the issues that black women faced for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” she said.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what it means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown by a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, who demanded that white Americans protest more forcefully against racism.
“I hope that women who have different, yet similar, reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and views of race that differ significantly in public opinion polls — will seek change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute consultant Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments face criticism from Ferguson.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper, which was meant to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it provoked a furious reaction among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youths in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform has re-emerged - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercadov<0xC3><0xA1>, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to raise the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a voice in women’s organizations,” she said.
Residential Pig in Ipswich for Sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig rested on it in the living room.
A one-bedroom detached house, which is for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Informational photographs included a picture of the living room where he rests with his head on the pork sofa.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"The photo was found there by mistake, and therefore it has already been removed," said an office spokesman.
In information about the property, the Connells real estate office described the former prayer room as "a single detached one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house has sparked interest on social networks, where some have asked whether pigs are included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
A lottery player in Harvey wins a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, one lucky man from Saturday’s lottery campaign will take home $1.1 million.
Harvey's traffic was the second time in five years that she had been lucky, the last time she had won a million dollars in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to sign up.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwest Perth is talking about the win.
This is the main topic and everyone is excited.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia last month shared a single win, ending a few happy weeks in a row.
Last weekend, the Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont had won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple have been betting for 20 years and said winning will allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not run at night.
Drivers want higher wages.
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time outside the traffic peak.
At the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend on the railway only during the first working day.
At the same time, we are thinking of people commuting to work during the day," the union said in a press release Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should affect primarily freight transport, less passengers," the GDL added.
The DB has not yet released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protests will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions demand an increase in the salaries of drivers by five percent and a reduction in working hours by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million CZK) per year, depending on the years worked.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept the increase in wages while shortening working hours.
They emphasise that the salary assessment of drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway staff, for whom DB does not count on the shortening of the working week.
There was a danger that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended the Barum rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think that something like that could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and proceed at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we still had two more ersets waiting for us and it was not possible.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk that the car would start to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You have passed five speed tests at full speed.
What did you think of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't cross the line.
Everything was caused by the fact that we had been chasing the car for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You scattered it so that you could really think of victory.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work didn't come in vain.
On the other hand, the result that we could think of did not occur.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one at the top who pulled out of the championship fight prematurely.
He also lost his favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have left?
Oh, yeah.
It was a shame for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus, for whom you are planning a car, was also at the top for a long time.
But he paid more to get off the track and pick up a nearly two-minute gap.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the ranks of the winners.
It was the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was driving very fast.
Exactly a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Not at this point, I'm sure.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to drive her again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance next year, I'll probably go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people got to the track just because of you.
Did you like it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, familiar or unfamiliar, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the fairy tale of Honz S<0xC3><0xBD>kor from us for this race.
Mira and I will have a European doubles race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you give us a hint?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Rallye Corsica was part of the World Championship, you reached your peak in the series in fifth place.
Don't you want to try the track again?
It doesn't.
An oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been issued with a certificate of incapacity for work from your doctor, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Afterwards, it was agreed that these days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement took place only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to take the leave in writing confirmed, this procedure has proven to be successful in practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take the leave, as in your case, can be denied and the absence at work can be judged as a long-term unforgivable absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute about an agreement with the employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, you only have the days listed in the invoice as an unforgivable absence.
The unforgivable absence in the balance sheet does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. the inability to take out material security in unemployment), but this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let him confirm in writing that there was indeed an accident, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "misunderstood", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the said document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification of the employer or the request for written consent to take the leave.
This prevents any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's Return to the Track
The return to track ended for Tony Stewart just halfway through the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart bumped into the hedge for the second time after his right front tyre broke in the 172nd lap, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car into the garage, did not speak to reporters and left.
Team chief Chad Johnston said Team No. 14 is disappointed but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we'll do better there.
Stewart crashed into the roof for the first time in a Sunday night race after colliding with Kyle Busch, requiring a repair of the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart on the road during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he progressed to 10th and then even to 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and ran into Stewart, sending both cars to pay.
Stewart continued, but dropped to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for a new taxi service manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, it collected 150,000 CZK per year for the same places for taxi drivers.
Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
In the past, the city used a draw when selecting administrators.
The winner was then rented for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently decided.
"A year since the termination of the original leases and the opening of tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is much more advantageous and fairer for Prague in general," the councilor said.
The most expensive spot is on Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n
The highest price was offered by those interested in a residence in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
They will pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million was paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi ranks were adopted by the city council in the autumn of 2012 and the original leases were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection process took place in four waves and a new administrator was found 29 sites.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We released it every time, creating practically a second pond around the hut.
Then we poured Savo there.
Unbelievable puff!
Our well in the cellar has always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, Grandpa smothered it with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was only on three curbs and overall peculiar, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she was there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed that the water didn’t smell.
We were wondering if there was anything wrong.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of misfortune, the board did not quite reach there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspector confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we illuminated it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground was a glued package with some dice.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a striped mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, the grandfather's invention, were the remains of fish!
And hard to drive!
Our cellar is also peculiar.
Someone would say that Grandpa just looted the cottage.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just choked sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
Ships are mainly there.
And the car.
And sun loungers on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling several already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
It is not necessary to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted to fight it, and that's it.
The air didn’t help either.
The whole cellar stinked.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away the things that were around: the boards, the heraclitus board, and so on.
Our cottage was greeted by a passing disinfectant suit at a distance.
We were wondering who might be pulling those disgusting remains over there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard for her to come to us for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who is not completely okay.
Didn't he shake Franta's disgusts out of us?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Drawing water from a forest well is not something I would like to do for a while.
One day we heard the fearful barking of our female.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza jumped over her and whistled like a madman.
Her mother was annoying her because she thought Réza was digging the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partly slipped into the club and partly leaned.
There was a sigh on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
The lizard, about a metre long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her from swallowing it.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the excess in the form of our whole family, she must have thought we should eat it when we are so hungry, and she stretched elegantly through the passageway into the cellar.
We flew after her.
She jumped to the well like a lightning bolt.
Just by the way, we noticed another smelly package on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there the other day!
Our new security around the pump was a bit shady.
We closed the cellar throughout the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we all lay down for one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's squeaking out of the well.
At first, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then a whole slurry sprang up at the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to get inside.
Dismissed employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
An injured employee after being fired bought a computer from the company and then sold it.
He was able to spend the money before the police were arrested.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking over, he took his laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them at the bazaars," Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissioner of the smuggling police, said.
The reason for the fraud was the employer’s revenge for the dismissal and also the profit of the money.
"At the interrogation, he claimed that he had used the money for loan payments," Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster was a pathological player who repeatedly treated himself in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in winning machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money in him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who was previously convicted of theft, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the punishment is also in danger for the bazaars, which bought the laptops under the price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers made a few changes.
The biggest change was the change of route that brought the destination to the waterfall, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we photographed and filmed videos together.
In order to get my point of view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend K<0xC3><0xA1>ta, we were obediently placed at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We said goodbye to the friends who walked around us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of bounces to warm up, turn on sports tests, countdown and start!
Screams of joy, but instead of a quick start, there was a whirlwind to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and start at the pace of ten o'clock.
We intertwine with a yellow snake of runners who, like K<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA5>a, run their first race.
So far they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost a whimsical touch.
The pulsating meat stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how much power.
A light hill on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> Square forces many runners to slow down or go for a walk.
Just before the transfer to the Theatre I see a police escort and immediately after him V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the admirable sighing of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to punch me, but just before that, my leg is going to get ripped and our hands are almost gone.
The theatre street gives you a chance to rest and breathe a little.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on the M<0xC3><0xA1>nes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe and my feet are almost alone.
For the first time, there is a moment of truth.
When crossing the road K<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA5>a skobrtn<0xC3><0xAD>k on the edge and shows the jump float.
I look to see if she doesn't need help, and I start a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
Goat Street is one of the narrowest places on the track, although there is no such turmoil at this stage of the race, it is still necessary to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I have no idea that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
At the Dust Gate, we are frantically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I also advise K<0xC3><0xA1>ta, because ten applause with the fans is like half an energy stick.
It's really working, we're accelerating again, and although we've fallen pretty badly, now the fighter has started.
We pass dozens of runners, when I pass someone who is particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
For the last refreshment no one is ahead of us, we accelerate.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three miles to the finish line will hurt, but it really needs to be done.
The sun is slowly setting, and the day ends symbolically, slowly ending the race.
The last exit to the bridge, turn and just a plane to the finish line.
The pace at which we're running, I wonder where that girl's going?
"Come on, let's go under three o'clock, let's go!" I called.
We try it, we sprint, and here's the target.
Thirteen hours and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a 20-hour limit.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
Close to the goal, K<0xC3><0xA1>ta breaks her legs, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows the exhaustion, but also the happiness of a well-performed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
The euphoria does not make us think of the pushbutton in the passages to the dressing rooms.
Here you can see that Goat Street was not the narrowest place.
This is all the way to the flood, which is under attack of almost ten thousand runners stuffed to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not the place for them.
I, too, lose my mind after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route were worth what is happening at the finish line compared to the previous years.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire centre of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s track change showed many interesting places for runners, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere of the Yellow Baths was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when it comes to the urban run through the historic centre, it has to count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by walls and on the other by a river to be the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I see it as very successful.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us to discuss whether you liked the route and what you think about the situation in the destination.
Prison guards in Bulgaria are organising protests
Hundreds of prison service staff across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The month’s watchmen symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The negotiations are still underway,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, the head of the General Directorate of Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the Universe Can Have More Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made it to the black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists deal with today - an attempt to unify two brilliantly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that finding a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
The basic problem of physics between two key theories (i.e., at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solves so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to lay people.
Greene, in addition, dealt with the complex material so freshly and captivatingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little bit more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the green of the nonviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mysterious.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our gaze from the universe as a whole to something more ground-based, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine dragging a one-hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a distance of half a kilometer (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily detect a long hose stretched in a horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from vision, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its large distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ants were at the time, you only give them one answer: the distance of the ants from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, hoses are thick.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where the hose is winding on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
Non-defective aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the winding hose circumference is short, "rolled" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, coiled, and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not intend to reveal the "swine" dimension of the hose's thickness.
All you had to do was get a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner – like a hair or capillary – the coiled dimension would only be revealed with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he uttered the astounding idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by providing an elegant and compelling framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be incorporated into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises as to how this Kaluz's view is combined with the obvious fact that we see precisely three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly predicted between the lines, and which was clearly uttered and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has three large, vast and easily visible dimensions, the existence of which we are aware at every moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can also have additional dimensions, tightly wound into a space so small that they have so far remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay a little longer with the hose.
Imagine that on the circumference of the hose we draw a fairly dense black color of a series of circles.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the coiled dimension even easier, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, that is, four-dimensional dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help your imagination a little, note the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we zoom in on the geometry of the space just as we zoomed in on the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth magnification level) if they are rolled into a sufficiently small space; this explains why we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid depicts the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circles represent a new, small, and rolled dimension.
Just like loops threaded in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of usual dimensions - just for the sake of clarity we have drawn them only into intersections in a square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each image below, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, as we move beyond the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new, circularly coiled dimension, similar to the loops in a thickly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, similar to how a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluzov’s and Klein’s idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the snake is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, such as our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly wound dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe obvious, large and extensive dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the powers of our most modern magnifying tools.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just a round bump inside normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration incorrectly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of the three common large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, except for the three usual still position in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we normally expected.
Are you curious?
You can buy Brian Greeen's Elegant Universe here at knihy.idnes.cz.
The price for an e-book is $149.
To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can hardly see the smaller coiled dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension could be the size of about one Planck's length, which is far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-act harmonic form, which you can repeat arbitrarily.
Anyone who is interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic designer since his graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which he is unfortunately unable to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as his brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start with training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can make up anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the shape again.
You just have to listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it starts to sound.
If you add the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of changing the tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonic and you will try to put her together with twelve.
So, practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits the castle Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the striker, who scored this time from a penalty kick.
Were you not nervous when he played, after all, he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't notice it in particular, although on the other goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You’ve made the penalty in half an hour, but you’ve also got the goal out of the penalty in less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, a horn came out of it and then a penal.
After that you got up and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the incoming goal until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also true that the locals said something about their game about the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You only scored for the first time on the opponent's pitch, while at home you may not have even scored a goal yet.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, this is a different category.
You waited four games for the goal, were you not afraid that it might be similar after the last game?
Maybe not, but of course we're glad we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal since last game.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometer-long crater.
Lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, arrives by underground tunnel from a kilometer-long crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now of greatest concern to scientists.
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the crack approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also open in places where it is located under ice.
If this were to happen, in addition, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökuls<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC3><0xA1> Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, from the crack rise clouds of steam and gases.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as it was in the case of the eruption at Fimmv<0xC3><0xB3>r<0xC3><0xBA>d<0xC3><0xBA>h<0xC3><0xA1>ls in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also much more gases," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind.
Traces of a sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange (second highest) for B<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow (third) for Askja apply.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
A flight day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, the aerial acrobat Peggy Valentinov<0xC3><0xA1> was introduced, who climbed out of the cockpit to the dam on the upper wing of the double-decker and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
This is the fifth flight day in Cheb this year and the organizers have again managed to prepare several interesting flight pieces.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on the wings" in the submission of the German acrobat Peggy Valentin, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or the aircraft Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his radiant covering.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots were deployed.
However, due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit on the upper wing.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," described Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main cradle of the program, then the following performance of the Mustang fighter was a notorious cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter caught up on the surface with the Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called on numbers).
Such a composition could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav S<0xC3><0xA1>zavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with the plane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never took part in it.
He was in the Army Reserves.
Since 1963 he has been working in the civil sphere.
As well as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his own hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
In the same place there is also another pearl of Cheb air day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was a huge machine at the airport that could not be overlooked.
His polished aluminum coating shone in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired by the French Air Force.
A small transport plane jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from the German Hof to the air day.
German neighbors in Cheb showed themselves with reconstructed aircraft Jak 18T or a three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann double-deckers.
Lucie Borhyov<0xC3><0xA1>: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Parental care was replaced by Lucie Borhy, at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator clearly knows none of this.
The TV news moderator was doing well, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It is only two weeks since the blonde ended her sixth Sunday, during which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
However, Lucie will not yet appear regularly in the main news session of TV Nova.
According to Blesk.cz, she is expected to return regularly in a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda now needs her more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibitions for the year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans a farewell to J<0xC3><0xA1>gr
It would be a good thing to do something like this during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union builds up," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a stunning Nagano team met again.
And the players who participated in the gold hat trick.
Players would love it, wouldn't they?
Definitely.
It would be a good thing to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one or two days can be found during the tournament, when it is completely free and where it would be possible to interfere with such a match.
We will tell it to Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>légrov) or B<0xC4><0x9B>d <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I get there...
But you don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in the representation.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially for the World Cup.
There should be riders who have to do it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed at all.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagano rendezvous?
The meeting with the players was great.
Man has revived his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was to pay tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echm<0xC3><0xA1>nek on an alternator.
Do you still have your first match of the season?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: me, Robert Holik and Robert Reichel, we entered in one trio.
For all of us, it was the first start of the season.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that can't be said.
In Jihlava after a long time caught Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
What did you say about his performance?
I'll never be surprised by Hashan on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized J<0xC3><0xA1>gr for reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
Hnili<0xC4><0x8D>ka also did a great job.
He used to work out with me one night, and there was a hole in it.
And now he's caught famously.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying
Prominent guests boarded the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chovsk<0xC3><0xBD> NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, national team coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
The Arsenal midfielder and the captain of the team arrived at the meeting at about half past 12.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, as he had already appeared before the press in the ensemble.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1st: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramm<0xC3><0xA1>da (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the meeting
Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> et al. can be supported by fans even before Wednesday’s match against the USA (20:15).
The representation for them opened Tuesday training, which begins at 18:30 on the Summer.
And it will be followed by an autograph on which neither Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> nor Czech will be lacking.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
That is what coach Vrba praises, who has just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to focus on.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so long," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image upon entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three games behind them, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she rebounded 2-2 and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage the general against the United States.
The first half of the year was to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's got a fever.
If he failed to recover in Wednesday's match against the US, coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how many years after a bad diagnosis she thought she was going to die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT), a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, awkward walking, and twisted toes.
The affected may also experience insensitivity or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she suffered from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be stuck in a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
Every day I fell and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and jogged."
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leaving the room, and looked into her records, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched the library for information about the disease and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I was eighteen, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime I'd gradually lose all my abilities.
I was all alone, and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you're sick, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening."
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of luck,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turn of the economy raise taxes
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes as well.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country with the acceleration of the recovery of the economy grew slightly last year, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 carried $27.6 billion into state and local treasuries, a 3.8% higher amount than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
Tax burdens - both state and local - rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion from 3.9% last year, the third year in a row since tax cuts in 2009 and 2010.
According to a study conducted by professional firm Ernst & Young and political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes rose faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, with 28%, has the lowest proportion of corporate tax revenues.
The researchers say the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of property owned by companies, which has increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1% growth.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% year-on-year from $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than one-fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“In Maryland, a lot of real estate is owned by businesses, primarily the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also seem to be increasing.
Companies in the region have released a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, which rose from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three counties (all of which have the same tax rate), 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the income tax rate set by law could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small business owners in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The income tax levied by small business owners as a personal income tax – the cost-compensation structure by which most businesses are organized – in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The trend and nationwide business tax hikes are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising to 6.2% over the same period in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may lag behind others because cutting government spending takes its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin’s Novorussia and Lafat’s scissors will be the head of Europe
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorossiysk
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support given to the West by the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Any more sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with part of the
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is due to propose a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was told to the journalists by the permanent president of the meetings of the member countries Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to change the form of sanctions are expected to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy to Replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU president who runs the summits of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton as head of European diplomacy.
The Italian woman, who will become the vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed in office by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term patient with a life-threatening illness?
In Czech conditions, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
Nevertheless, the statements of the doctors who addressed LN indicate that they hear about such requests.

But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motologic neurologist.
There's a CIA handwriting in it, they needed war, writes Huml about the shooting down of MH17
Czechoslovakia’s Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were announced with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
In addition, according to the legislator, the CIA's handwriting is known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are again offering the impossible.

Joan Rivers' family: "We hold our thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today she is not losing hope that an eighty-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call to the rescue service, according to which she had a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
The reactions didn’t last long, including incredible online support from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted headlines
That the media are distorting reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more appropriate is the word anger.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are “Israel Attacks Gaza.”
It is only in the text that you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the ceasefire.
This will be followed by the headline “Both sides have violated the ceasefire.”
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so they are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing all over Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been 60 years since the end of World War II.
The people who survived Shoa are still alive.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish pigs" and the like, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to finish?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews, they were destined to eliminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the “watchdogs of democracy.”
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to remain if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech people would be wiped out and the Czech Republic wiped off the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to “theirs,” for example, to Gaza, they’ll tell you why they do it.
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-of-the-line health care (I have seen for myself how the top-of-the-line private Hadassah hospital, which is funded by sponsorships from Jews from all over the world, commonly goes to Arabs and they are, of course, treated there).
Hamas also shoots at its Arab brothers.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled area, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemning Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Tell them that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of the world’s terrorist organizations.
Inform them that in the nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, Gaza’s administrators do not pay, and they are even angry that power supplies are sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate Israel, but for example in the construction of housing, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed the claim Information from Monday morning: An online retailer — a producer of videos and hundreds of other things — is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be purchased, but because YouTube was expected to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for one billion seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which just founded Justin.tv three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts from games to it - with the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live streaming gaming".
Twitch interface.
On YouTube, "Let's play" videos are already popular, a kind where wise men (mostly the elderly) give the Mystery Science Theater processing games.
The fact is that when describingTwitch, YouTube comes to the fore a lot, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch, did not upset anyone much, it was a textbook example of how the established company pays off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmett Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us meet it faster.”
The next mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to watch sports, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about playing games instead of just watching them.
It’s one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder playing Resident Evil at 3:00 a.m., and it’s another thing to watch a stranger get 20 headshots in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run games in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time complete the game in record time are fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of gaming or humor, their channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and ranks fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube might have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men advertisers want.
Twitch CEO Shear said both Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games” and the media don’t seem to be hesitating, nor do they seem to be swallowing viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Attached is the original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
The word of God or the word of man?
It is as if human inquiry is completely futile compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to myths about God written down by humans.
If there really is an intelligent one with a creator for some purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who added the last series of evidence that point to the evolutionary detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, they can tell stories.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and not gods at all.
If there really was one true God, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the supergalactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, only one holy scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without predecessors, parallels, or alternatives in any language, for mere human authors could not measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and truthful evidence, and reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each in some way claiming God’s guidance, regardless of the continual divisiveness and separation.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qur'an, the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h's Kit<0xC3><0xA1>b-i-Akd<0xC3><0xA1>s, the Zarathustra's Avesta, the Sikh Ad<0xC3><0xAD>-Granth, the Mahabharata's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the Book of Urantia are all considered true.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the path to some extent.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence, and none of them can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of Western Michigan.
I am not saying that I have proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defense) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies—with the fact that each may also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and discrepancies in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that here we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is definitely not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of Moses and Moses do not attribute the authorship of any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetians and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were discredited and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these adjustments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Moses religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Baal Zebulun, the "Lord of the Mountain", was changed to Beelzebub the "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was intentionally and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Law was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Nicaea House.
Four Gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising one’s hand, as if reality could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way in which the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually found out that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
Thus the nucleus of the canon evolved out of the narrowness of the original church.
So the Council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this random mix of rumors, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by men and certainly not by much enlightenment, quite the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it’s almost anything from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic wand to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We’re talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and whiskers were an integer.
These people believed that if they showed the pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, then it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written about sex by uneducated and bigoted savages who have overlooked or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, violence.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing God’s will.
But the creationists are still ignoring this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t even have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “the worship of creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly “holy” books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So this is a kind of idolatry, where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "immutable word" of any god has been devised, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often intentionally altered and twisted by mere erroneous people.

The participant of the cube challenge squatted her jaw
When she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom screamed that she had damaged the structure of her facial bones.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after screaming at the quivering challenge by bending her jaw.
While she was pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.

I tried to close my mouth, but it didn't work, it was stuck, and I realized something was going on.
Then it happened to us and the sister, you could have laughed, but I had to get to the emergency room quickly."
A 20-year-old girl had to be hospitalized to get her jaw back to its original location after participating in a fashionable viral wave on Tuesday.

Chinese school attacker stabbed nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, forcibly entered the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half past 11 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, citing a regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in accordance with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-borns in L<0xC3><0xA1>ny how he had to sit in school
The youngest students were taken to their classrooms, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately you are no longer waiting, you are free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first children as a gift to the puzzles.

New Art Director of Nova News is David Fiala
David Fiala became the new art director of news and publicity for Nova Television on September 1.
In his role, he replaces Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since June 1.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba, he has contributed to the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news sessions of the Television Newspaper, Str<0xC4><0x99>piny, Pr<0xC3><0xA1>sk! and other publicist programs of Nova TV.
David Fiala is very good at controlling the synergy of communication between the editorial department, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of art director of news.
It has a sense of typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to take in the visual news of Nova," says Creative Director of Nova Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, the public got nude pictures of celebrities
A screenshot with an extract of the missing files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server has been posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, according to the US server Mashable.com.
He allegedly obtained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in Deadly Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
U.S. magazines have reportedly expressed interest in the footage, according to reports on the 4chan server, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely really a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that allowed to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
For preventative reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with their Apple ID.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and above all you will have space to delete unguided images, so that they will not take up unnecessary space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Val<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>k in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save for a College Script
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student has come up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from high school classmates with a nominal compensation offer to delay their resale.
“I got a book of calculations, which normally costs $180, for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options for how to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students are becoming online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
Lessons are on the rise, allowing students to use the semester book, often at a significant discount, than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 on-campus bookstores, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Shops, less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores.
Here are 101 Best Ways to Succeed.
Buying online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, a retailer specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
If you don’t mind other people’s comments or wear and tear, the textbooks used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, “Calculus” sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their lecturers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not essential for the work in the seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, a popular alternative to buying used books is also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Leasing
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Get acquainted with the terms and conditions of the business in which you are borrowing the book, including retribution for notes, highlighting or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-Books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, as it guarantees you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Bahno, the same mud.
And then they found in the well the torso rifles from the end of the war
The well is located a short distance from the church of St. George.
We discovered the vegetation around and began to extract an annual yield - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the muddy bottom, we ran into a barrel," Radomil Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it was a torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The finding is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," the newcomer added.
All wooden construction objects have decomposed over time, therefore they are unusable.
Her body is preserved, however – it retains its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably for fear of being displaced.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They threw guns in the woods," the finder said.
The gun was the only thing that enthusiasts of the Autumn Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of hand grenades around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully tapped the mud so that no accidents would happen, but there was nothing else down there," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
The find will end in the museum repository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudolpice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War there, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktualj.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
With each such interruption, it was not possible to ignore the names of the people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and again he devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in reserve, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday - when we had a conversation - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence team estimates their number to 30.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not yet the Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captive countryman and could free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if the Czechs fight in the Ukrainian flags of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists regard these men as mercenary mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including a Czech, for example - they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say that it has long exceeded a hundred men.
We have long since stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we've only freed them... not saved them from the war if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors in war, surgeons, but we definitely aren't.
That's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We're gonna save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe that explains the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've gained some of that authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them that they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm taken prisoner... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.C.: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
... (long silence) ... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
These are played only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian army is going to do something like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give any figures.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, as well as veterans from Afghanistan.
They are striving for independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least they say so.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists are already full of oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents – for life and for death.
As we say, they ate it up to their throats.
By the way, the same dreams and aspirations were being manifested by people on the Maidan.
And now I'm speculating a little bit: Russia is supporting the separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
This sentence of mine already hides in itself an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: What do you think, for example, of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war line, I am unarmed, showing my bare hands to soldiers or armed men.
And I'm always on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in an optical pointer.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I always see well... and they can press the trigger of their weapons at any time.
A bomber, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small gubernia in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it, and he considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters, in a Ukrainian TV talk show, you called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do his best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking I always get at least five times the fear.
So why should I hide with the view that Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.C.: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jacenuk a "rabbit".
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of the Ukrainians, an animal to be feared or to have respect and authority over others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament in war, to beg him, to play his tricks with him, to threaten his office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in wartime.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister does not have the right to family, friends, rest to cry emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk?
She's acting like a pubertal girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, only constantly complains about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Sales
Sylvester Stallone's replacements returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the U.S. and Sin City: The Woman for Whom I'd Murder would return only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million over the first weekend and also films for children like How to Train a Dragon 2 were a disappointment for the cinema.
According to the article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, when it comes to children's films, it is their own quality that is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year for children's films, and How to Train a Dragon 2 called it a "functional" sequel.
When it comes to movies set to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film yield is similar in quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewership and the increased popularity of Internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood cash-crashers, Netflix’s net profit from online services reached $1.2 billion, which is almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted Hollywood’s “collapse.”
In light of the current decline, some commentators say there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible major box-office hits in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Monkeys, and The Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in sales simply “cyclical.” For the Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the biggest cash cracker in history and no one will worry about selling.”
DPRK threatens Seoul again, detonates another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged test of the missile came shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a site in the northwest of the DPRK and had reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a missile for the first time from Chagang province, South Korean media said, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud-type missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place.
Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO youth tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a Sunday afternoon tour of the Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
When they did not return home, worried relatives called the police around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the pair were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit himself in the head.
The policemen stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transported by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on your leg
It was the 23-year-old forward who could decide, but he failed in the two greatest odds.
After the goal, the shot called close three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on goalkeeper Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your ashes splattered on his head.
"I guess I should have put it up under the lid, I'm a little out of it," he thought.
Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, except for Mikul's 11-minute attack, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they began to push the Hanites, but the chances were they were not released in the block preventing the locals and the missiles caught from a distance by Kveto<0xC5><0x88>.
Fifteen minutes later, we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not change his chance, so it ended 0:0," coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvod hated.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the squad, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k and the three-goal shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k were missing, who are guests from Sigma in Silesia.
This, unlike its previous policies, did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes deserve to be discharged.
Sigma was more footballing, but we didn't let her do anything except one standard," said Petr Bar<0xC3><0xA1>nek, coach of Slezan.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combat.
I think Remiza deserves it, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma scored four points with a draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znojmo, conditioned his million-dollar deposit into the box office by diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can be no talk of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noticed, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek: "I believe that it will come and when he gives a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I will replace him immediately, so that he can save goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice impressed Venice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, directed by Alejandro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez In<0xC3><0xA1>rritu, who was one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, other days indicated the impression that the interest in the 71st annual festival in Venice has somewhat decreased.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman followed the critics recognized, but for the audience less attractive pictures as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been covered by the crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to find a last-minute place in the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has affected even such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present only in connection with films.
While younger fans have longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully hosted dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main event was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the story of Out-of-Competition, directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison, based on Philip Roth’s novel, seventy-four-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as a strange ironworks owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actress should not be missed - but does the artist still need awards in the Pacino format?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud to report to the country from which his grandparents came.
Items for Italy
In fact, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman’s first film to be rewarded with a long applause.
The Calabrian mob’s footsteps are seen in it by looking at the family relationships between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and an actor.
He was also fascinated by the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her despicable anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not expect a warm reception of either The Redemption for Fame, or 3 Hearts, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not that few in the first half of the festival.
And while the festival footage has all sorts of depressive themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film called She’s Funny That Way, a funny comedy out-of-competition in Venice and shot in the style of the 1940s American cheerleaders, managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
Police arrested four manufacturers of pervitin in Prague, drugs were driving from Poland
"The detectives have arrested three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who, from November last year to August this year, produced and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9, "said police spokeswoman Jana Rössler.
First on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> street caught a 24-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who appeared in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of doses.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers were caught on Wednesday morning, August 20, at the site of the Malaysian fire station," the spokeswoman said.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vov street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various tools and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman, who had not yet been punished, by transporting drugs from Poland or selling them to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
The forensic experts also carried out several home inspections on the basis of the judge’s order, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, injection syringes, hoses and other aids and items that, according to the expert, can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer Has Been Punished Seven Times Since 1995
"From the available records, the police then found that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times since 1995 for property crime, the woman was not sentenced," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was sentenced in 2006 to probation for sexual misconduct, and a 37-year-old auto mechanic, who has been prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
This, too, was largely a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to a decade in prison.
In the case of three people, the investigator also gave the prosecutor an injunction for a proposal to impose a detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case were not as crucial as those of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, in Italy, hand-made chess with a playing board of 42 x 42 cm will serve as a good example.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
No one would be surprised to find that instead of a classic rider, players have at their disposal a figure of a mounted horse.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable gift to you, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) in a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disruption of high schools and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few well-educated people, and statistics show that high school students are well-educated.
The beginning of the school year is here.
Great preparations have been taking place in schools over the past 14 days.
Usually, these are routine matters, such as transferring the pots from the summer storage back to the classrooms and sculpting the chalk.
In high school, they'll have a little bit more frmol.
A few days before the start of the season, they look for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opened and resumed its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by enrollment in the register of schools managed by M<0xC5><0xA0>MT.
“The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Francois Hollande.
Valls calls on the deeply divided left to “show its support” for a militant socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by his side," he said, applauding.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France’s controversial thirty-five-hour work week, despite passionate speculation by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who proposed earlier this week to set the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande urged the Socialists to remain “cohesive” with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, made a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "losing faith in the future" because of her.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the ongoing internal disputes among the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon have patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that the situation is changing," he said.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant ordinances should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restriction on the use of dogs.
Prague will not have time to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in the representative office before the October elections.
"Additionally, decisions on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several city halls, such as Prague 5 and Prague 7, have decided to abolish land-based gambling on their territory.
But the games won't go away, and the gambling ordinance won't change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
We wouldn’t be able to do that technically now, for example, due to deadlines for commenting and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current legislature, which has to approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the ban on gambling will be held on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, the so-called bushing.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal for places to the magistrate, which would like to expand the current list of prohibited places, complains about this.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
A decree regulating the outing of dogs the city is preparing for several months, not yet completed.
The location of the games and the problem of busking are solved by city ordinances.
They may be issued or modified only by the representative office of the capital.
Councillors only have an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory of the proponents of Scottish independence within reach
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake a third time when she almost put the question on billboards all over Scotland whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you don’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor do you get their respect when you start threatening them.
The New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the money changers from the temple than to have them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and so in a televised discussion he repeatedly asked his rival, the unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting the single currency.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate.
But the debate over what Scotland’s currency will be has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London banker on the issue of currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond put it, "he went to bed with the conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish prime minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots don’t have to jump out and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.

The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that went nowhere and we were just hanging out with Grandma in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, fifty-fifth, rolling on a bike up the hill around Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun was shining on her back and shoulders, the rays were beating goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday mode, sleeping until half past eleven, a week will be worse, the moments before bedtime will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up in the morning at half seven.
He's coming Monday.
It usually doesn't rain, on the contrary, the summer is squeaky in front of the school.
To swim in the ghostly light on a bat and feel like a plastic figure in a glass bucket, there is the school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
Zapotec with an obnoxious pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more drawn, girls more busty.
There are bastards out there, those to avoid, it's just as interesting how they keep each other together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming are now laughing hysterically at something, I guess something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is old with me.
And again, new first-years, some nervous and some delightful, why are they even climbing here?
Because it has to, the education war obligatory.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned nursery with a mop, unfortunately still the same, which supposedly lends the pupil keys from the metal cabinet, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, now it is not done, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It is only from this idea that the stomach closes and the head begins to hurt.
A head that gets even worse from math, the devil's game for the elect, which I don't belong to, and never will be.
Again those threes and fours, not fives, to hide from the test, to fit into the bench and best sublimate, to be there and not to be, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream so far stories about the nicer girls and the nicer buildings, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She left her daughter to die.
She is facing an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabin at a bus station in Jihlava.
With no help from others, a little girl was born, and after she had cut the umbilical cord, she wrapped it in a prepared blanket, hid it under the jacket, and took it to the roadside, where she put it in the bushes several tens of meters from the road.
Born on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
In the bus I had to go to the toilet, there I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the cord of the umbilical cord with scissors I wore to school," the defendant described, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to her place, put the body of the child in the backpack and carried it away, took the body out of the backpack, packed it in a black needle bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Brod<0xC3><0xA1>," she says in the lawsuit, with the fact that she is not entirely from the backpack.
It could be in tens of minutes, but also several hours after giving birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when put under a jacket, undercooling or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman, at a more undetected time from February to April 12, when the baby's body was found by random witnesses under a bush by a pond in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, secretly gave birth to herself.
This time in the bathroom attic apartment in a family house.
Without checking to see if she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic containers, including an needle bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend handed her over.
The father of the two children was a friend of the accused, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
Even for this reason, he is not now in court, he has only been punished for a violation of the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn’t the right one, but it came to me as human at the time,” said the indignation of the defendant, who was supposedly in a relationship with the man and feared him.
In the course of her statement, the young woman spoke fairly well.
Tears swirled in her eyes until she talked about her relationship with her parents, who she left on her own when she reached adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't buy any equipment because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I wanted to put it in a baby box, but I don't know what happened, I didn't do it that way.
I can't explain that to you," the judge replied.
However, she refused to act with the intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, according to her, was also born dead.
She did not stop drinking alcohol even during her pregnancy.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also reduced smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to everyone, even on repeated inquiries, that she had health problems, that she was watered.
And so is my friend.
The main proceedings will continue at the castle court on Tuesday with the statements of the court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk of up to 18 years in prison, or even exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise to Acquire 3 Billion Dollars of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world’s third-largest cruise liner, has advanced in negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company that competes with greater competition from Royal Caribbean Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has enabled access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruise ships and rich clients.
The deal could be published as early as this week, the source said on Sunday, but warned that negotiations still may not end successfully.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment firm of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% on the previous year.
It is expected that the twenty-nine billionth segment of cruises will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The companies compete to make these customers a preferred option when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public tender with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority stake in the company since 2007 since closing the $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with a cruise liner owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting held a shareholding of 28%, Apollo 20% and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offer includes Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong a day after voting decision provoked by Chinese authorities
There was a group of people standing nearby loyal to Beijing, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates in Hong Kong’s 2017 election will be present.
All candidates must first get the support of the nominating committee, which is likely to be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democracy activists to renew the promise and cripple Hong Kong’s financial center of the “Central Occupation” protests.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tensions, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city’s business district and occupied it.
The press conference, to which Prime Minister Li will address, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also expected to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of Hong Kong's government offices this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin urges Kiev to start talks on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
According to a description by Russian newspapers, on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on "state sovereignty" of the segregated areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that areas of eastern Ukraine under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with the apparent strategy it has been following since the riots five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novoviska to a non-professional.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were dominated by separatists after Moscow on March 18 annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and the separatists have designated the newly occupied territories as “Novorus” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass has published Putin’s words that “a prisoner is an illusion” for anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon as Ukrainian politicians launch a campaign ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26, while government units attack civilian oblasts.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kyiv’s leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate concerns about the threat of cultural and language rights in Russian-speaking areas.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can be granted to the eastern regions only by the Ukrainian government.
This is not a matter for negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s move to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s approach to addressing the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million population is ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have much greater difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million population are not Russians and public opinion polls that took place even before the conflict showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, maritime trading facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - following the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give different regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy, however, differs significantly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed the insurgents’ next move last week after Russian troops and tanks from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign aimed at occupying strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This accelerated a huge civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a more unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 regional troops penetrated the city last week.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian airmen captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal.
Geoffrey Edelstein expressed his disgust at hackers who likely stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal involving hacked celebrity photos brought to the internet a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker claims to have sixty nude photos with Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michella and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The leaked photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based actress Grecko have reportedly been made public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for a hand last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should be kept private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, has told online newspapers that the hacking is “unshameful” and those who have become its target “seem humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have obtained thirty photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of herself at the top of the pool.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, which was co-starred with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Representative Lawrence TMZ said: “This is a clear breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers have improved on Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that co-owner Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they finally brought only a point from Opava for a no-brainer draw.
The club boss was a little better off with the deployment and combativeness.
Payout money could be coming to the club soon.
"I'm going to keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm already much more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite Sigma not winning, players had convinced him with improved performance.
The combat and commitment we played with in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive him for not winning.
If we played like this since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," says Lébr.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the home team, then balanced the game and in the second half it was already better.
After the victory, Calvo's confidants reached the goal, but did not reach their chances, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
But to our complete satisfaction, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Either on my side, on the side of the coach, or on the side of the fans," Lébr said.
Sigma has to count on the pressure
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's match, left a question on Lébr's statement last week.
After all, he was talking a little bit about pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
They're all trying to pull on us.
“Today we showed that if we fight and we all fuck around, we can do it,” he said.
They took warnings to heart
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realised it, and today it was clear that Mr. Lebra's warning was taken to heart.
Even before that, it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and throw it away,” said the Olomouc coach.
It was the same as the first 15 minutes.
It took us a long time to come to terms with the toughness and realize what the second league was about.
It's not just about football, it's about combat," Kalvoda said.
It remains to be hoped that the Sigma will work from the start in the next matches.
"I'd really like to believe that," he added.
