What is he doing? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new city councillors from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representative office.
The members of the new council from <0xC4><0x8C>SSD "tested" as they know the notorious slang that was created at the city hall during the last years, when the current coalition partners ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political smetan during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not quite understand the familiar terms.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague's politics," said Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, Councillor for Culture, in response to the test of the "Kmotrov" dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, the mayor of Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezin reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
“It’s the only expression of what you present to me that I sometimes use.”
"I generally don't recognize slang."
From the glossary published by Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "going to the confectionery shop", "the bull's neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "blame".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head the Prague education in the future - first promised the interview, but later no longer took the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, immediately rejected the test.
“I don’t deal with these things at all, and I’m not going to evaluate how the civil democrats are having fun.”
"I am now deciding how we will understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not have recognized in the title above that he is an influential businessman and a friend of the speaker Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Voldemort" Kautsky does not tell him anything and the only term that he correctly guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is Blanka's tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then deciphered by not only matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also the environmental councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as a Blanka tunnel.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Pache is also familiar with where to find this figure - he knows the meaning of the term "going to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," is Shy close to the enlightenment that it is the headquarters of Janu<0xC5><0xA1>ka's companies.
In the same way, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequentants, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've been seeing colleagues, too, but it looks like we don't really have that kind of thing."
"We call each other names, sometimes abbreviations and snippets of names are used," says Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who is nicknamed Hulda by the parties.
"I was called Birch at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Newspapers.co.uk has tried the name and it works.
Councillor Weinert is a great-grandfather for the party, a representative of Miroslav Poche, who pointed out fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in their intra-party speech.
Hulda does not like to hear Hulda, but Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Obushka Law" reportedly recalls that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> earned his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women who are declared witches in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, are unable to participate in work, for example, for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The one who "becomes a witch" is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate can only be achieved very seldom."
"Even young healthy women do not retire because they help with work and give birth to children," describes a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, is caring in a special house for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their ranks by their community.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information booklet to help limit the witch hunt.
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read,” said Die Standard.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, a 72-year-old woman, Amma Hemmah, died last week after she was tortured by three women and two men, poured oil on her and set on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, an oil was lit on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
It was said to have burned after the group wanted to "throw out the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 24-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying, “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While the government is trying to mitigate the witch hunt in Burkina Faso, the president himself took part in Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, launched an extensive hunt for witches who were supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He summoned shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal security, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink herbal potions with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and renal problems.
The two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were finally released from prison.
Bakal's tenant: Burns in the stoves, higher rent signed
An elderly man stepped out of the door of the RPG customer center "charcoal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new leases to three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in execution.
The deregulation has raised the rent for all three.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay 4100 crowns for the second category 2+1 apartment from next year.
"And it's not hot water there, and petrams must be boiled," the man points out with his finger in his son's new contract, which he has full power to sign.
"But I signed it," he explains half annoyed and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which has called the new rental conditions "improper and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7, when it will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waved his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he murmurs.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments still have non-market rents in the Czech Republic.
This is why I decided to visit the “Laboratory” in person.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ovsk<0xC3><0xA1> quej<0xC3><0xA1>rna RPG is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9 am.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a trigger.
"Rental 2011", there is a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and a number paper comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already ringing on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're on your way in half a second.
After a while, an older married couple comes to the rent to ask, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern the new rents at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems as before - requests for repairs, insurance incidents, and the like.
Letters with new leases are received in the mailboxes in Ostrava by tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since mid-November.
RPG apartments in their letters propose to them an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special booth for new rentals was opened at the client center on November 18.
“It’s going on for a week, so it’s only in progress,” the employee answers behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the parliament and the Ostrava native Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took it quite loudly, and even now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even replace the toilet plate," the man said at the outset.
Most so far, according to the employees, pensioners come to see if they get a discount from the rent if they sign in time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
The half-discount for February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign a new contract by December 15.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov's "deregulation" partition, but the questions are definitely not overloaded.
"Out of yesterday's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the rent for 2011," the employees estimate behind the counter.
On the website and on its boards, the RPG proposes individual contract negotiations where necessary.
However, if the two parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal proceeding,” the RPG notes on its website.
"No one's going to be judged here," thought one of the employees of RPG Flats, and the man on the street in front of the client center partly agrees with her.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don’t have to judge myself,” he said.
However, the employee soon becomes insecure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartments, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent still does not reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that, according to the owners of the houses, the owner of the house is the main reason for the negligence of the housing fund caused by the angry tenant.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG rentals could have invested $4 billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be $5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the upholstered seats of the Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room repeats some of the information highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less is related to 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter and month," it appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38%.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," notes the RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not eliminate rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will be given by the company back to the apartments, mainly to the heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority should be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The office also includes a kindergarten, the architects understood.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that it also hides a miniature ball with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it has been open to the children of Arch.Design employees.
Design and architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios came a number of important buildings in Brno, counted with space for its company mini-stool from the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly at the age of the baby boom, and she cared so that women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of shorter jobs, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding jobs with caring for a child.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and for two years to provide qualified personnel and operations.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate the miniskirt at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for a grant was significantly helped by the company Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nurse and teacher of the Ministry of Education take care of the children all day, therefore children can go to kindergarten without age restriction, although most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more are replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program load in the mini-college is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, incentive games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and drop off stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
In this way, parents make more productive use of their working hours.
It is not surprising that a naturally loyal employee-employee relationship is created here.
Arch.Design has thus been included among Czech companies, which offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The House of Bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the back of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Due to its organic shapes, it earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house is played out by dream lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
When you observe in detail, you can see geometry, rhythm and a precisely thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the brightness of the colors is further enhanced.
The twisting and twisting of shapes is equally apparent in interiors.
The wood in the waves copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of the doors, cockatoos and bars.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, located in the Eixample district on the bustling Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia No. 43 shopping street, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
It was designed by the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> project started Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and the Park Güell, in which there are other works of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "House of Bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it a "swinging house".
It is also said that on the top of the building is depicted the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree inclination.
When Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> was created, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when completed, the city council was devastated and requested a correction.
For example, councillors were troubled by the fact that the building also interfered with the pillars of the public sidewalk.
It was never corrected, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the challenge of the city part, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry.
The entire six-storey house crosses the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is covered, and skylights is also impressive.
The game of two colors delivers maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and honorable apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed at the tours because they found it to be a very profitable business and in addition, they expanded the tours with common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Entrance to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of admission to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly socialize with some of the inhabitants of the mansion and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grill: women have different requirements than men
Not a superb bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. mattresses and grill, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they need to be complemented harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things are decided, from weight, height, age, health status and the gender of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior into which the mattress and the grill are made.
Typical example?
For example, on weekend cottages, where they do not regularly sink, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they are slower to "heat up".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
Sometimes it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don’t have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they’re still on a hard board, they retain moisture: mold could also appear underneath them.
The choice also depends on the habit.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they weren't sleeping here."
"They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam on their slashed shoulders, heels, and hips."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misreceive "information" from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, many hockey players, but also other customers, years ago, mattresses with lazy foam were looking for.
"Today it is alright, suitable mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, at night you will not turn over like after a hard game.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Linen foam also acts as a protection against bedbugs.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, a master craftsman of the Department of Upholsterers and Decorators, who is already devoted to the issues of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grill and mattress, but here be careful when buying to adjust the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not succeed with each frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the molding and firing layer.
"When you touch your hands or sit on a mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Full-coloured beds, where the mattresses and substrate are like mature Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, you can not wash their cover, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble a large (and clogged) mesh.
Even therefore, experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
But everything has its own buts.
Therefore, the advice from the sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up the detachable coating, but add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Even though mattress covers are commonly produced today, they have slipped around the circuit, so that after opening we get two parts (very important for washing and washing size!), nevertheless, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) during the shooting could be reminiscent of a heavyweight fight.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a grid?
Oh, never!
Maximum on the bed intended for visits for one night.
However, still provide the board with ventilation holes (if it does not already have them) and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a wicking layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-laying lamella grilles with 14 to 18 lamellas, but you will always pay for grilles with more lamellas, 28 and more, where the lamellas in the lumbar area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning slat grids do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, because they do not react to the positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the lamella, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be used.
It is a special lamella fastening, which allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper is nicely "bumped".
For men who have "shoulder across the back", definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, which in "men's" began to use a softening zone precisely in the shoulder area.
Women also remember - they in turn give them a softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or plate racks with so-called multitorsion springing are designed.
The pressure is broken down into several points and the tension is reduced.
However, beware, once you apply the right mattress and grill the wrong pillow (big and "punched"), most of the "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support the head and the tips only interfere with the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (along with the shoulder cradle of the grill or a softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straws filled with grass.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least admixtures.
The trend is simply bio on mattresses.
Raw materials from oil, from which polyurethane foams are produced, are replaced by natural oils, for example from sprouts and soybeans.
Soybeans are used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio for mattresses means that the core is made of a material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While men "cool" the birch plant extract to make the mattress cover absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, "melt" the coatings.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with broken cell structure, is more breathable than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams and "lazy" foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thighs and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes you can take advantage of the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam in suture for 11,990 CZK.
The second one can already be purchased for free.
An era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was initiated by the "cosmic" tempo of Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous congestion during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, in the cold it hardens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedspreads, but also for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, for example, on special pillows under the feet, which relieve the feet and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want devices to monitor people, so they want to look after their children
Anxiety about your own child is driving more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally created for the search of cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is still about as big as a box from sirek, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to ask for the means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening," said Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example, if they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Great expectations were raised earlier by the parents of mobile phones, but they can be turned off as well as these tracking devices,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> says.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of a suspected kidnapping, the perpetrator almost always ensures that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
“In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers surveillance services for both cars and people, even in the event of an immediate destruction of the surveillance device after the attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to send a position regularly after a certain time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices also have built-in clonometers, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless lying down, the device will immediately send out a warning with a location indication," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can be carried out by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with current monitoring units is that they are either devices similar to box-sized pendants from sirens or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, this is why devices that look like a normal digital watch are now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage in the fact that the potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll only recognize them after a while and that may give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle surveillance.
It is a combination of location detection via a GPS system (using normal auto navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has ignition cords to wrap the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords, with which the cracks are fired.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense supplied 224 kilometers of cord to the warehouses.
The army has a stockpile of 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cord is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff in the justification for the purchase of such a huge number of ignition cords MF today wrote off that the soldiers in training consume 60 kilometers of ignition cords per year.
However, the calculations of the military pyrotechnicians addressed by the MF TODAY show that every year all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of lighters.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's supplies would last for more than a decade.
If, on the contrary, the basic training of each new professional is sufficient for a maximum of two meters of ignition cords, according to experts, the army has ensured - even with the increased consumption of genie or special units - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade have complained to Minister Vondr recently that they have almost no ammunition in handguns, so shooting is also limited because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't mind that they buy so many lighters from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision and they know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, to which we as traders try to satisfy," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, business manager of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justified the hundreds of kilometers of purchased cords also by the fact that the army will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from STV Group, however, only talks about the four-year life of a lighter and a police or military pyrotechnic even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to make his name public because of criticism from the army.
At the end of its life, each munition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of ignition cords.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's two hundred and forty-four-kilometer delivery," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of fire cords by police pyrotechnicians, who dispose of ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before the expiration date.
It has proven this for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and it can also more flexibly obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech, according to the pyrotechnicians that the MF addressed today, will face the same problem in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which today "lacino" buys.
To this day, I still draw on the contacts that I have gained through the competition.
The winning place in the <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostn<0xC3><0xAD>k of the Year competition helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year’s Animals of the Year competition was Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun, a 22-year-old entrepreneur from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a semi-demolished house with five apartments.
That he was still a student of the third year of high school at the time was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation at the time did not give me a reason not to try to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, he added another one of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's businessman number one.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, it was the victory in the Animal of the Year competition that contributed greatly," Pytloun said.
The victory brought him more fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me extra often, and I have to say it was nice,” he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to anyone who is trying for something.
There is no need to win, all visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have otherwise come to.
"With some I met thanks to the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, had a bit of an impact on every employee.
And he has about 70 of them.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them to be involved in something that has won universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is put in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at the Farm.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the victor’s determination, Farmet has worse times ahead of him.
Last year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, won the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition at the Slovansk<0xC3><0xBD> dom.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalica.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all of my colleagues and raised our confidence in the competition," said the winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered his father Karl <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> to rent a small workshop as compensation for communist confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the non-professional public after achieving success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, was not only a sign of victory euphoria in the Farm.
The award was based on the company’s economic results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of mechanical goods.
The crisis culminated, which had not yet affected citizens so much, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either."
"The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were also layoffs," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
However, they managed to keep the company profitable, even if it was smaller than before the crisis.
However, what is not exempted in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training center from the grants, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, and won the main prize in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It is clear that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A Survey that Removes Nonsensical Regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the business slaughter.
Some unreasonable regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year's Absurdity poll has become the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the business register, although an official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the business register during checks at insurance payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
To illuminate all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to cancel those nonsense is the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is already the fourth part of the business event organized by Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> noviny and is increasingly popular with the public.
If last year about three thousand voters took part in the vote, this year there were almost four thousand.
And it is no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is still enough and enough with us.
"Perhaps in the number of lists for tax recognition we are in the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anybody can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition closes.
Afterwards, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "antiquity" and leaves it to the public to vote on the Internet during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, or more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations, have been applied for this year’s survey.
Tips were sent by businessmen, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was the requirement, for example, that cars for the maintenance of highways and highways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which regularly participates in the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Professionals of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws businessmen’s sticks under their feet, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year that today only complicate business unnecessarily,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to repeal unreasonable regulations does not evoke emptiness.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a booth to an exhibition or a pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by the amendment of the Commercial Code.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was the notification of the labor office for its foreign employee on a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the office.
This was mitigated this year by the decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell away.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The new category in this year’s fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské novin competition is called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“This is how we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the rebel of the year competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the year 2010, companies for which business success is not the only long-term goal have applied.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activities differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen national finalists was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a series of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
In turn, the paper mill in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, which has more than 70 percent of its employees with disabilities, was awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition was placed in the region as third.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers to buy from Czech manufacturers, promotes civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains CEO Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region in turn thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its company events.
"In addition, we support the Man in Need Foundation, which is helping the local Roma community in particular," says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension supplementation to its employees in the form of extra-standard bonuses.
"We also contribute to food, transport, training and recreation," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers no later than 15 August.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to enter this competition alone, as this is a subcategory of the Company of the Year main competition," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in the past days, anti-corruption police arrested.
The detectives set the local businessman in the media sphere and the real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>a G.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender in order to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the tender would be given to a specific interested party.
He was supposed to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>a G. half a million crowns.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for moles in public procurement and in public competition," said Legal Chief of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, noting that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
A 46-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
The manner in which public competition could have been affected can only be speculated with a minimum of official information.
A spokeswoman for the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Land Fund said that police officers were actually arrested at a remote workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public tender has the correct name "Call for the submission of tenders for land transfer rights according to the Land Act" and takes place in the event that more eligible applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons shall, in the context of the challenge, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who applied for the challenge, and since he himself is also a entitled person, since he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested party for the land not to participate in the competition.
I think he's got a severance paycheck for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money in custody.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had superior contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He appeared in the case of former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building has already been issued.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the access highway to the Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he exchanged it very favorably with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to take action, because otherwise the blocking of the land would endanger the building.
Households will pay hundreds of dollars a month
From January onwards, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supplies and rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw up to hundreds of crowns a month from their wallets from January.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies, and in many places it will also undermine the supply of central heat.
The price of electricity should go to households in apartments every year by a hundred crowns of rigging than now.
The price of electricity from renewable sources has been reduced by all major suppliers, which is why there has been a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
Gas costs slightly, but at a time when people are melting the most and thus have the highest consumption.
It also has to count on hundreds of extra crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are rising across the country, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay about CZK 50 per month extra for central heating from January onwards, and families in Liberec will pay more than CZK 1000 per year.
People in Prague are also threatened with more than 9 percent more water and water supplies if the city increases rents on infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the roasts will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still belong in the republic-wide comparison between the lower ones.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and livestock prices are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rent prices in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends from January, can rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree with the new rent, intend to bring the company to justice.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments could increase by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with farnet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whisky stolen from parents.
These are the drinks, after which the most often ends up in the care of doctors drunken, who were not even fifteen years old.
The exception is children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital from monkeys.
This results from the experience of doctors who meet with similar cases on the income of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them.”
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the law primary of the children's department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of my dad's closet, it's whiskey, or else Fernet and vodka will prevail."
"The vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not so much of it can be felt," explained the primary.
And the spokesperson of the Motol Faculty Hospital Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> also gives him the truth.
"Most often it's Fernet or Rum."
“This is modern alcohol, especially in primary schools.”
"In some cases, it was a slivovi<0xC4><0x87> they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n's primary, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drunks on hospital admissions are quite common.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at the pediatrics in Moto<0xC5><0x82>a, where ambulances are tied up by schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl lying with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was brought to us with 3.5 perm of extra alcohol in her blood combined with ecstasy," the doctor described the particularly serious case.
"She was at the fairground in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for a dance party."
“The interesting thing is that her mother didn’t find it strange that she didn’t know about her daughter for 48 hours,” the mayor said.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of increasing child drunkenness.
However, according to experts, dependence in the true sense of the word cannot be talked about in children.
“The term ‘alcoholic’ is understood to mean several years of chronic alcohol dependence with all the phenomena associated with it, and it is not in children.”
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a characteristic misguided family-social background," explained Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to a spokesman for Jurin, about 40 drunken children were hospitalized at a paediatric clinic in Motole by mid-November this year.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital can get into the statistics.
Children's drunkards who take their parents home after an outpatient treatment or are transported home by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases when children just sit after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations that Pelikan can rely on: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink grief from a bad testimony, or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"I have also experienced seven child drunkards as witches at the same time," said Pelikan.
A drunkard who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will trigger irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They are actually better at it because they have a nice evening experience and a good awakening after that and nothing hurts them."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikan admitted, sometimes spoiling patients' pleasant moods by at least listing the costs that their treatment required.
Carriage by ambulance and hospitalization on an emergency bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly to the children at the visit, how much their intoxication cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make money on that one party," Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not access regression procedures, in which parents would collect the costs of treatment, in cases of children drunken.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s, out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercise or performance years.
This is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was still operated by the Czech army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seater L-159s.
These are so far reserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the trade - the company Omnipol - took over already last week.
When the planes will physically depart from Vodokhod, according to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the press department of defense is not yet known.
"Single-seat L-159s for the exchange were decommissioned from long-range aircraft, with no additional deposits and investments from the Ministry's department."
"The two-seater L-159T1s have been replaced in their current condition and form," Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vu Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, as the ministry signed with Aer Vodochody in May 2009 a contract worth 200 million crowns to rebuild four unnecessary L-159s into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged that the aircraft will be deployed in the armament of some of the alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.”
"It is therefore the customer's business how he will implement this thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Economic newspapers recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirko Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nko.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The then defense leadership argued that in exchange it would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a court-martial.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in fourteen days.
Longer index than ring finger indicates lower risk of cancer
Men who have a index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Cancer Journal on Wednesday.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of a finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a index finger on their right hand that was shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same risk of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were just as long.
However, for those who had a index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men by the age of sixty, it even decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows about this study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly snow driven, roadmen in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89. and 93. km in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was told by the dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At 91 km, a truck crashed there, at 93 km, two trucks collided, the accident caused injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the trench.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go just behind Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then drive to the 182th kilometer on K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are several kilometre columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, immediately upon arrival in Prague.
There is a few centimeters of snow in Prague, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are created, for example, on Proseko, and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the route between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague Crisis Staff is scheduled to meet again at 8 a.m.
The railways and the airport are also facing problems.
Czech railways have already had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow.
For example, the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already slippery, but only with increased caution.
Three side roads are impassable in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko, in Brno there are snow tongues and in Blanensko there is a need for some communication in the above snow chain.
Among the most affected places were Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far there are closed routes: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
In order to stretch them, you will need to apply milling cutters.
When they will pass, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, caution is required in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert spray because of the protection of nature, there is a layer of snow up to five centimeters, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of snow fell, the most in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is stalling.
U.S. military has a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new gun is kind of like a small super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special rounds of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive crack, actually work like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only on impact, but at any point on their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected above, and if it is subjected to a deadly rain of steel chips, it can eliminate it from the fight.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sending out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gets a specified target point, according to him, adjusting the gauge and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will charge and fire the shot at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Relocating 400 jobs
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building on the Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on Wednesday, a giant in the industry specializing in computers and their maintenance, in July next year 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing administrative building on the Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyons Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesman of Fujist, another 100 jobs of the group, which are so far divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The offer of rent was very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurt-based chief economic spokesman Markus Frank (CDU) said it had managed to gain a “global player”.
It's a "fantastic expression of trust in this place."
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was reportedly informed in time by the company’s management of its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property in Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a question of avoiding a long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-Platz, which used Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building projects of the spa town ten years ago, along with other buildings on Marienbader-Platz.
Between the railway station and the city hall, a joint project of the city and the private designer, the so-called city entrance, which was criticized both for the massive construction of areas that previously served as parking spaces and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved in.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers companies computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Mohan branch is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu’s employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS to be added.
For this purpose, the Astro Park administrative building has been rented 7,000 square meters.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the stellar floor plan, which is twenty years old, among others also houses the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server – threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting in the way.
Amazon has turned off a detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic posts.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
WikiLeaks, the platform for detection, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is due to be detained, according to one newspaper post in the UK.
Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server.
"A free speech in the land of the free," activists said in a tweet on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly thereafter, Amazon downloaded WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic posts to handle a high number of accesses to documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: "OK - we're going to spend our dollars now on hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman’s associates reportedly searched, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the Guardian reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step sooner, given the prior disclosure of classified information on WikiLeaks," he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"WikiLeaks is acting illegally, impudently and recklessly, and that puts our national security in jeopardy and threatens life on the planet," he said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should assist WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate the stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian in the UK, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
An internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigues of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were also threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly concerned about his own security, Hrafnsson said.
That’s why the founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee has asked the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser said on television — apparently ironically, Assange should be “murdered” and Obama could use a “target plane.”
In the meantime, a verbal shootout broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recent espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not entirely sure why we’re interested in the opinion of one person with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Envoy was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for the development of “necessary structural reforms” that are needed after the release of messages from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are in danger of being exposed to Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
IJsuniversiteit
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
With Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly obsolete ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooling box, rubs it in a tray and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn more about ice cream, you will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university to make the ice cream from his machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some people yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country’s industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and a Canadian woman in the Julia household has come because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a notable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then turn the machine with a faucet and pour pasteurized white base cream, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment on your own?
Luciano warns, let himself be carried by the spirit of the time to the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collide and the customer eats the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of the basic mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the department with fruit or in the department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream made of white basic matter, which turns eggs into a yellow cream and cocoa as a basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants of the course are allowed to ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and walnut ice cream – either with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Walnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
It’s only when the balanced mixture properly enhances the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the machine to automatically produce the basic mass.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools down to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when he gets out of control a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in the double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech head Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been contracting with the Ilsi lobbying union for several years.
It is financed by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in EFSA’s control regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA rules are in full agreement with the Ilsi documents and carry a handwriting of the industry, which should be checked by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from the EFSA moved to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta with no additions or transitional periods - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also revealed a recent human link between the EU’s Industrial Lobbying Authority and the industrial lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics – among other things for estimating the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn will do in the field,” Then says.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not determine reliable results.
"If they don't look for risks, how can they be found?" Then he asks.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists as in the USA, now also in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists anymore who would not be connected with the group.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
"Industry is controlling security research," Hilbeck believes.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the train station in Stuttgart, with a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the railway station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft coarse stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Don't go away."
It spreads: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all that was created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they melted into gravel or disappeared at the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden hut that used to be a watchhouse.
He says he was insulted and threatened when all the papers in September said he had bought the remains of the northern wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do the demolition at all.
And when that happens, then it is most reasonable to continue to use the stones.
Then took about 200 S-21-opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it when rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, loaded 25 large trucks.
Half are still in the woods, the rest are sold out long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled what was in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long since turned into "pebbles" or as the edges of beds with herbs.
“This stone is really nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political drawer."
He sits in his off-road car and drives through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 40,000 tons of stones.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the republic.
It's braking.
In the snow lies an artistically crafted sandstone.
"They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
The Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on our way up through the woods.
It shows the pile: a red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Small travertine."
They once belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow are stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were previously broken by hand and transported by simple sledgehammers and bullscarves, he becomes completely reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like that were broken."
He did not become rich, not very rich at all.
The stone merchant now employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glasssmith and a gardener settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
In the near future, he has to go to Cologne.
Stones will also be saved there.
Fighting Talents for High-Potentials
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are pushing for bread rolls with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies strive to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, just like VW, and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums, even before they get to the labor market and will be interested in them by others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of successes of their students, companies strive to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs, and suggests ways for them to join the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig will take care of the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both parties: “Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.”
"VW can meet students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates more closely, and rethink who would fit in as a collaborator."
Such cooperation, according to Sell, is not uncommon.
What’s new is that they are so openly fighting for their students.
"Otherwise, it was a rather substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a long crowd of candidates.
On the contrary, it must try and attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the data of the Association of German Engineers VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow even more.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes challenging Recruiting events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt, in which participants must find a path according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also take a look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
It is decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials in universities will apply increasingly harsh laws according to the Dictatorship.
"We want to be different with our Race."
"A single trip on a sailboat was too little for us."
It seems that Dykt's talent hunter is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
“Some will soon finish their studies and are planning to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies are presented classically in the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“Like Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of the manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company's website.
"Currently, it's just difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do an internship or write a diploma thesis."
The solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company strives to attract other benefits: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Large companies often can’t offer that,” says Stübe’s personal department manager.
Money has not played a major role in finding a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good options for the procedure are other decisive factors.
In one study, Solarworld ranked the Great Place to Work Institute 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and work environment, and they follow the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of Stübe’s personal department hopes that the placement will bring her points for jobseekers.
"I think that the interested parties are particularly informed about the external assessments of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
It advises its customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means primarily internal measures.
“The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
This is professionally called internal Employer Branding, that is, the promotion of an employer on the market within their own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best envoys."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Over the next few years, no new oil wells will emerge off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus definitively canceled the earlier plans.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new wells are prohibited so far.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling turret "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
In the face of this misfortune, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled to the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The centre of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in effect since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and stricter security regulations.
At the moment, the control authority is fundamentally being reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption accusations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
Industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil mined in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry," the BDO's current industry survey reads - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are shifting to appeal – at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of oil leaked have destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People are fed by theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means it well.
“Don’t worry,” reassures an environmental activist: “You’ll get plenty of oil mud in front of your lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to take a picture of a boy waving over his chest with water surrounded by smears: the scene looks almost beautiful in watery gloss with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown crusts of oil are floating beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she had collected enough shrimp in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is one of the worst-affected areas in the world.
On the way along the river mangrove swamps with many lateral tributaries is only noticeable the full range of the trigger.
The engine on the boat boils brown mash instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stick out of the ground like black sticks of licorice, rarely appearing palms let their leaves hang sadly.
In vain we look for flocks of birds that are common in wet areas: once the engine is silent on the boat, it will roar in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a spooky silence.
“What’s happening here is the environmental warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari sadly: “We live in constant fear of health.”
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where battles have been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first conquerors from Europe came here, here in the 80s the first resistance was formed with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the production had to be stopped by the Shell Group in 1993.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while it benefits daily from the entire area of the three-sized delta of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni region lies in shale, the situation is very unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, they stick out of the water of a steel structure like a bizarre statue: "Christmas trees", so they are too gently called the heads of drill holes.
They are 50 years old, most of them rusty to the sea.
Every moment such a head of a drill hole breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of oil have flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that spilled into the sea near Alaska in the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell labels sabotage and organized theft of oil as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists say cracking wellheads and leaky pipelines are the main cause.
Shell is demanding much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, said Richard Steiner, a U.S. scientist in 2008: Only the amount of malfunctions in the pipelines is "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-polluted workshop under the open sky, the character emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by the pipeline, partly arbitrarily scattered across the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil warms up in the barrel above the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the pipeline into the catch pot, then it drops at the end of the kerosene pipeline, and finally, oil.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four barrels of 300 litres per day: "We'll make 34,000 Naira" - around $22.
The people of the delta are exploiting a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of oil can be overstated by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the pipelines everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day in the Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw materials will be illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, to tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate about whether the people caused the disaster and their interventions or the lax way of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If the oil companies had not considered themselves as invaders and had not so perfectly destroyed the life of the fishermen, there would have been no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refinery.”
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so devastated that it only takes into account the departure of the group: “Maybe other nations will turn out to be better than the Chinese.”
Michael's worried.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any moment."
If they're found by a special military unit, they're not in jail, but a painful bribe.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country – like all Nigerians – want to profit from the raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our country down to the bottom in all respects," says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major security flaw.
Investigators discovered during a search of the machine that landed in an emergency, a possible construction fault that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of Qantas' Airbus were apparently more fortunate when they landed in an emergency in early November than previously known: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
Perhaps the failure would have serious consequences: a single oil junction could cause cracks due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She justified the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against that company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce described the oil as the cause of the damage.
Up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered to be sufficiently important for all concerned to be informed.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily left three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced an A380 engine as a safety precaution.
A two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Statewide snowfall will cause chaos in transport
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, the connection of trains and planes is disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire republic fell on Thursday night at freezing snow temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the new snow.
There was also a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a stormy tide on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, snowstorms have caused considerable problems on highways and state roads.
According to Meteomedia, the level of violet alarm in Saxon Switzerland was the highest in the world.
In some parts, 30 centimeters of new snow fell, and strong and fresh winds caused winds.
There were a few cars and trucks there last night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported serious problems on the roads.
On the A2 caused wind and snow slow traffic and constipation.
In Thuringia there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper pipes and folds.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
At Saalfeld in Thuringia, he had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
The snow wind was blowing across the road.
Many flights have been canceled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, cancelled flights from Munich have already been reported.
Frankfurt-am-Main has been canceled for 40 years, Fraport said.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although there are few unconnected passengers left at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holland.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle stuck.
The driver is dead.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until morning.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after she and her car turned on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light washing, and therefore will rise even with slight gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of the strength of the storm.
But it will be a big winter - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could carry up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group apparently wants the costs of the renovation back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by "Financial Times Deutschland" with reference to a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still looking into whether it makes more sense to own or sell the property and then rent it again," he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution is once again giving up its corporate headquarters in a short period of time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors of its own fund and subsequently expensively renovated them.
According to the data, the energy conversion converged around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, experts estimate the value of the renamed towers to "Greentowers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not clear whether the building would be re-sold to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to the memory of flooded miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions down below.
The dead have still not been rescued, as the security situation in the mine remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, a powerful explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were trapped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not come down for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
The dead have still not been rescued.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the monument of the flooded miners, 29 tables were built, on which were helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothing and surfboards have found their place here.
In state government buildings, flags flowed half-heartedly.
New Zealand hoped the miners would come back from the "deeps of the earth" to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son, Zen, was stabbed in the bottom.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
British and South African miners were also inundated during the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers started by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the poisonous gases dissolve, it will begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Is horror suitable for an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to break the old boundaries again with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents almost with supernatural force - this sounds ideal for young men's spectators who are looking for bloody action, because our hero kills his enemies with his cruel methods.
On the other hand, the One-Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word throughout the film, and even the other characters will utter at most one or two sentences or be dragged into a passionate dying cry.
Otherwise, it is silent and lurks in Scotland’s horribly beautiful hilly landscape, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult film enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and a very quiet shot of the camera.
It’s good when the film has multiple target groups, it’s only a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically prevents his works from bringing either more humor to mainstream or less brutality to the art audience.
Most fans of the art cinema seem to be distracted by the splashing brains and guts everywhere.
Supporters of action films will be stunned at the latest by the moment when One-Eyed sets sail with a group of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem and remains hanged for eternity in the windless fog before apparently the crew arrives in America and beyond.
No wonder, then, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to the cinemas and was now released only on DVD.
It is a shame mainly because of the beautiful footage, but also because behind a particular facade, places with blood clots, hides an exciting cinema, which deserved a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or precise action, everything is an atmosphere, a fevered dream that has become a film.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn will not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly choke him with his frigid shots and cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that radiates from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eyed will keep something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, who will become a time for enemies and transient allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It represents destruction, but perhaps only for those who are corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued new warnings about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression – and won’t even allow control.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), her name appears when it comes to the reactor that was allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that diverts from the current.
Based on a U.S. foreign intelligence report from the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the reactor's components could have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still presented photographs that showed the building close up or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been in operation shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some secret service reporters in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation “reliable.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is that he has a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat said in the summer, the IAEA has “enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of supposedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and they also properly leveled the ground.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen was able to find traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors through a member state just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But that was denied by the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he banned auditors from second inspections in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," the then-ruling Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, said in a recent official statement.
The investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 and is "growing into serious trouble due to the credibility of the office," as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) considers three other devices to be "in working order" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated which devices are involved, what function they have, or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspect objects.
It appears to be located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - which is precisely why Syria refuses IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance to the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite imagery that material was being transported here and there between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one of the facilities should be "in connection with fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e., enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium should later be decomposed into a bomb, there are only probable estimates of these central issues.
It is also not known whether the wreckage, which could hide important traces, is hidden in these three places.
As if hundreds of truckloads have disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have information on where the debris came from.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria inspected in 1998 as a suitable stockpile of radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in contact with the reactor in one analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
The images from space show, however, that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it did not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the IAEA having spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the auditors are interested.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed, and therefore the thing is not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means that the Vienna nuclear control authority has to do.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already spoken of "the possibility that I am avoiding in the future", but so far he is hesitant.
On the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as a diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie began working on the still-unnamed directorial premiere in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but it also causes unrest.
There is persistent talk that the woman, who is a Muslim, will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming moved quickly from Sarajevo to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film has moved to Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote via the UN refugee agency UNHCR to ask for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is also the UN ambassador for refugee aid.
It is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where they were raped, the love stories did not end, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization, therefore, recommended the UN refugee agency to release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scene did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed filming after a small shoot in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not arrive anyway.
The young author stresses that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet, which sounds really quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war began and they meet again when she is dragged into a Serbian camp as a Bosnian Muslim, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie’s movie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie argues that she is under pressure that "is not fair and is based on wrong information."
Now she can be liberated by Hollywood hackers: by illegally posting her script on the internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but Gone
Tonight is once again good for the Irish.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout with joy at the sound of loud music, their ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Cork is hot as players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups – and hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and also tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming beer game and reticent computer scientist, it doesn't work out very well together.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, responding to the pressing question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, he is going to an interview in January in New Zealand.
“I have such a strange feeling about it,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Event Manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like it in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts at the ESRI’s Science Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin predict.
In 2015, there were 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is devastating, above all, the young, educated Irish, who have only experienced an upsurge so far.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
There was a need for everyone, there was money left.
Three out of every 10 men and women are unemployed by the age of 30.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything comes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, he goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"Let the last one be extinguished, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in the dark because the government says it is only lying and offers young people no prospects for the future.
“They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her classmates wandering from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps to the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gala, but freedom and joy.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known about building something somewhere else for six months.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can repay the house loan at home.
“Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy,” he says when he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I’m basically not in at all.”
She laughs in despair and walks through cool rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked at the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% funded by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
A construction engineer doesn't like the cries he hears so often.
“No one has to starve – our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
She laughs and then tells the story of her father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keeping an open future and simply waiting for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there’s one more thing that’s troubling him these days: his 27th birthday celebration in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she'll turn up for a farewell party.
"No emotion at all," he says and drinks a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds troubling."
"Let's call it a celebration of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private business.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in the journal The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the area.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related issues.
The first of these is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it was a large increase (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support was created during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies in a wide range from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luis In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lu<0xC3><0xAD>s da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see graph 5).
About 31% say that either they or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private business and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say private business is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country, this percentage has risen from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there support private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical Elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant urns filling and repeating ballots, ballots scattered across the channels, polling stations shattered and intimidation.
Election halls open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many relocated due to the January earthquake, roamed around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including a number of alleged predecessors, have been shouting that it was a scam and calling for the election to be canceled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are bound to René Préval, the unpopular resigning president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive match is scheduled for January.
Not all electoral hopes are lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, the rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former First Lady, have resigned from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
The problem may arise, however, if Mr. Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is marked by the election commission for having achieved a decisive contest.
Due to the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were concerns that the turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Some 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so it is clear that the Haitians are planting for themselves.
At the top of the center
In the weeks when she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the president of Argentina, is benefiting from public sympathy, when her popularity has increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections may depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez renounces the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized when Mr. Kirchner died of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after the chaotic sessions (which saw the government being falsified and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% growth is likely this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speak of numbers approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was suffering an economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than on inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleaned up INDEC, a statistical agency that has joined in monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez moderate this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be why President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is making it known that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with bondholders who previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina did not pay back in 2001.
Now, President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is facing a deal with the creditor governments, which are grouped together in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF, as is usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index that would resemble the introduction to clean up INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathies will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many opinions that her husband held in politics.
Half-Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of them eligible, voted on November 27 for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself is a representative of the sentiments that prevail on the mainland and have a strong commitment to business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three out of five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favours greater independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his party’s votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with KMT in the city councils.
The elections took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags of sparsely dressed girls.
There was even a secret attempt to assassinate him.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, wounded him, and killed a spectator.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or to settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting influenced the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates fretted about plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
Therefore, the KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP has also given up on inciting anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to reality and the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would certainly also like to see political integration, but in succession.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rioter and a proponent of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was challenged as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their side is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry about this shift.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma’s ratings were poor, despite the staggering pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go with him in the campaign.
Its unpopularity seems to be mainly based on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he is reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly advocated proposals to support Taiwan for friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antoni Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
The speeches at the request of the President and the people must be observed by law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer whom President Obama chose to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is considered one of the surprises of this year’s Grammy Awards with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a bit late, but it is in accordance with Grammy rules, where an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and lively hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about the Spalding as a success, which was recorded in 2003 by Norah h Jones, the most eccentric of the category.
Elsewhere, the Grammy jurors rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a harrowing New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk has won several well-deserved accolades in the category of large ensembles, where the chamber jazz ensemble Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" has created a beautiful example of how a bass can have a volta.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Music
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
Leading the position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a score of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a score of three points.
Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009, were among the nominees.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project; and Synergy the Art of Vocals;
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Art of the Enchanted Wander" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House.
Composers who have been nominated for the Grammys for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonon.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists this year, only women were represented, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition of the classics, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned Mosque in Temecula Receives Planning Commission Approval
The planned mosque in Temecula gained unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, jurors decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means that justice will always prevail."
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who are against are only shouting loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The talks began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no longer any America," one comment appeared.
"We are a Planet of Monkeys with a Statue of Liberty embedded in the sand."
"America is falling."
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York.
In Temecula Valley, Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families squandered in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more suitable space than the storage space he rented together with the filtration system manufacturer.
A new mosque measuring 24,943 square feet in Mediterranean style architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council on the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside of the main elements that have been previously considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not proof that it’s some form of really ‘extraterrestrial’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
Scientists have found, however, that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“You’re starting to wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside of Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this novelty published to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery “shows that other planetary organisms may be able to harness other elements that drive biochemistry, and that the set of elements we consider to be ‘standard’ may not be as absolutely essential to life,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to replace one after the other.
"Arzene is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
“As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements from each other.”
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the influence of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increased possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example on which this fact could be proven.
Arzene was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs have been found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, the Los Angeles area sheriff said on Thursday.
Four exhibition dogs - two akita and Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs then on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what locality, nor did he share detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation is still going on."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not caught so they could comment on the case.
They were very happy when on Wednesday afternoon, their two accomplices found themselves in a shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's agents found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and a 10-month-old female Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi breeds Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were scheduled to take part this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
The other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop away on an almost monthly couple’s journey through dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Britannic hound - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke left Welsh corgis in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who takes them to the missing dogs, and the dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to scream again now that the restructuring of MGM is receiving final approval from the court
After 18 months of shaking and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and television shows.
Thursday’s report that the plan meets U.S. bankruptcy requirements leaves MGM with no legal hurdles to relaunch Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of the slimmed down studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on a planned $500 million loan to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it is a merger with an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve their finances, as management struggled to afford $300 million in interest payments annually.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Enron CEO and sales expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelise and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the funding of two films, which will feature the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, sought the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
However, there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers — Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club — and watched what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law was working; this year’s technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While there have been relatively fewer new toys with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the number of toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are plush animals that sing when you press their bellies.
Once pressed, the animal gives a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start tickling, you can’t stop.
The best combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll from Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk on the moon thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
Children are testing Mickey's dance instructor toy, though their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards, which are designed to turn driving into fun with work with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re shipping a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for kids ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest, easy-to-use variant, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't have as effective tutorials as Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids ages 3 to 12), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with newer and more.
No version is compatible with older drives.
The iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for kids ages 3 to 7) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children over 8 years old) is a set of five dice that are no larger than a box of matches, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before the time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised wordmaking.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented at the highest level in the toy shops.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old) which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a pet Puffle.
A little bigger than your toothbrush’s brush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for kids over 5 years old), the latest in a range of button battery microrobots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun to make a maze out of cubes and watch him find his way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of a more delicate police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlled his orders, and issued orders in a semi-voiced manner with military authority.
He wanted the female members—China’s state-of-the-art urban order enforcers, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and lust for violence—to convey a certain impression to the crowds around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "how pretty girls look!"
The four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the rules.
Four headgear perfectly fit on the hair, which are perfectly tied by blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said contemptuously.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered the new Brits to have a higher education.
Guangdong province has changed its grey-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced strong armaments with steadfast looks: In 2009, a report said that 50 officers were relentlessly surrounding a stroller with snacks and staring at the owner as the home salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police by 13 women, who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The aim is to show not only the rough side of the police but also the gentler, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media usually captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat an uninvolved spectator to death after he used his mobile phone to film how they were proceeding in a landfill protest.
Last year, there was a training of police officers in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, a homegrown melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
A video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese policemen attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about the tactics.
The paper said it was "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district announced an interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News first looked at whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is too mentally demanding for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if by a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the series of nature and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district city board, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for parallel features of the face.
Which means that the issue of good looks is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or malnutrition certainly does not apply.
"He can't allow a sluggish or sluggish person to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who guards Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the dolls, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, the group stands up against more than ten merchants who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times already!" said Miss Xu, as the marketer began to run, and for a time left his wheel with a cart full of noodles.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s basically the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies free marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers as their male counterparts to seize the goods.
They can only threaten to report this fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that police had killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can only be guaranteed hardly.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were on duty that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry as he wished.
15 minutes away in front of the police, facing angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said.
"It's usually the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, lawyers told the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who, up to the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into the national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision that followed almost a year's investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of an investigation and that it is not planning to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a federal lobbying ban violation.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was to lead to Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, being silenced about the senator’s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many report documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was Mr. Ensign's assistant until recently, he was excluded from the law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to be in violation of the ban on lobbying.
Evidence that was released "showed that this was a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in advocating for clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Department is wary of political lawsuits, after a large number of failures, including last year's decision to sue the state for suing the defendant.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
“It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to laws,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that the Attorney General's Office called him on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's advocacy team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had submitted to prosecutors.
"I am not pleased to detail my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which an ethical group is accusing Ensign's parents of paying the Hamptons $96,000 to violate the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the leading Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "boring" into the Department of the Interior about the subject being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the affair was first reported last year, Mr. Ensign apologised to his constituents and resigned as the fourth consecutive Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would swiftly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," she said.
The Cheshire community appeal is addressed on Twitter
In the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
Minute by minute, they sent messages of horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says more than 140,000 tweets were about raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was reprimanded, and an official termination of the death penalty was due to take place, for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes’ lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process – including the widespread use of Twitter by key reporters – has created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disturbing details has then led the jury to make a decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether new rules in the courtroom should not be required with the advent of new technologies.
“As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom is affecting the rights of individuals to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Hayes’s attorney general.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State briefly rejected the claims regarding last week’s proceeds and that the media had been “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notoriously well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was a "carnival atmosphere" because of the media.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes’s verdict half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules may be needed to determine the way in which the courtrooms communicate, which was unimaginable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
“There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media” in highly monitored cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting immediate communication to courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
For example, lawyers claim that in Mr. Hayes’ case, it could be a preconception when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrifying criminal photographs in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the photos of the victims, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Advocates say they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly recalled a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict issued last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly extinguishing the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily influx of media, cameras and reporters in court,” the lawyer wrote, “was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and is perhaps also a national rarity.”
Their focus on Twitter’s activities is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more turbulent than the reports mentioned later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should govern the scope of further proceedings.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with the often-used arguments that social and technological changes require the courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Dr. Sheppard’s judgment, because of the breadth of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its insults and negativity, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first wave of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
The talks between President Obama and parliamentary leaders on Tuesday did not bring any major breakthroughs on key issues that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of views between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party convulsion.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect, which transcends the ideological gap that still divides the members.
And it is quite difficult to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
The two sides are now in a probationary period - they are probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation were also conducted by the participants, with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to propose the rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The elections sparked the party’s emotions, and then the party’s silence.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cut at the end of the year has expired, and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can’t look at how they support tax cuts on property, while the unemployed refuse unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new inaugural treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that politeness will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the assembling of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These supportive lines are clear in initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their view, to push the deficit issue into the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to be able to present their plan as official recommendations and thus fight to get as close to this number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among elected jury officials who suggest that in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have little foundation or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first starts next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans urging Obama to deal with the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the bias in the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public’s reactions very closely.
Anyone who threatens to vote down is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the matter.
The bias and direction is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
U.S. document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city’s governance is in the hands of a “kleptocracy” and continues to be part of the bribes and protection bribes that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a February filing.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy — which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical office” — will take its own when the money begins to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in the cleanup.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges for many years, and won several false accusations for such charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's shit."
Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their society is corrupt, it will show up for a vote.
It is, however, unusual to encounter such details expressed in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The Moscow city government and its association with criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the report said.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or 'protection') provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Mosk.
"Analysts have identified a three-stage structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security Service, Department of the Interior and militia are on the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill vacancies in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, “shop owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), as they not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on the line."
The record says that while the selection of money is complex, protection itself can already have trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly enough, their trades are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made only small progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, in a recent interview.
“It’s part of this bureaucracy.”
"They are not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no political classes anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power-sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy’s report, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening hours, certainly did not arouse the enthusiasm of the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue in the matter of solving the problem.
During a CNN interview with Larry King, Putin said the documents released by WikiLeaks could have been fake and reacted angryly to a statement that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev’s Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it's our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to cope with the past
In a sparsely lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the Anlong Veng High School principal reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander of this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is also shattered in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children for the first time.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly bring the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the conviction of a former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest grew among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts to reconcile and their attempts to reengage in Cambodian society.
“Among the former Khmer Rouge are resentment and fear, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and ousted the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they began an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sara led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-nineties, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Sampha in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared about them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters descended into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
“These people had only minimal benefit from surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
“They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.”
"They were upbringing without any idea of making a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok fed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to make sure of everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the chief prosecutor and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was not enough to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
A recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
“Peace is in Cambodia and it is stable,” she said.
"If there's another prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned repeatedly that instability would occur if the court sought out other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodia has to dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer relations means gluing broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other.”
The Centre has published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, with 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the Ministry of Education history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Wengu knew very little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts,” he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a lot of magic here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, the road is weeded and filled with discarded plastic bags, leading to a rectangle of black groves, covered with a rusty metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was assassinated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, and a lot of local people come and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hopes that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to appear to be stockpiling uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it is giving up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they hit the rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of covert operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the remnants of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was expelled.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 nuclear safety summit.”
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush.
During the Obama summit on nuclear security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity...We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus acceded to the United States and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it on supplying the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Non-Proliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for the manufacture of weapons.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will seek to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel human rights repression.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, and the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent observance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make CIA jewels with the flights
The Spanish government has made no mention of CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and Al Qaeda members to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo over Spanish territory, the U.S. envoy to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is also written that the then first deputy of Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Veg asked the Spanish executive to be informed and "could thus show the flight attendant that he has a suitable target.
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of involvement in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The prime minister's representative said the Council of Europe's announcement "deprived Zapatero's government of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed so that they are not caught unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also suggested to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low a profile as possible, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that, as far as he is concerned, he does not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information," the embassy said in an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns about “obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors” rather than declassification of information by the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of a luncheon between the U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do to the people what they deem appropriate," he had already instructed his collaborators to "take a break from the situation."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP) in this regard.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Popular Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any hints that the Zapatero government has tolerated or intentionally ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on states."
Admitted mother-murderer complained on the network about mother's "concern"
A young woman talked about a child when he was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galicia"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had been using for a while, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a area, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the emotional life of the wife, which the ABC newspaper reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They've been dating for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
The little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palmyra.
However, from the content of her communication, it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote, "Alberto is some kind of angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, he seemed fine, but now he realizes he has to be with the little guy all day and can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send you the baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he spoke of his return to his residence: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go for work, so that I do not lose this place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to him.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, so he'll be with me, and it'll never happen again in life that I'll leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There is another contribution in July.
When tapping on this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
“He’s on one side of me and he likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day.”
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"I'm going to go to summer school, so I'm gonna save some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
“Alberto says he didn’t send you any email videos, look how he wants to meet me, sex is needed.”
Thirty-second message: "The kid's fine, he's going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Monica's blog posts are dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she was called "Muki ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palmyra yesterday, where she arrived from a liaison centre in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant does not remember how it all happened and "had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in a bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
People would win 4 seats in the House and PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia - see above) would lose 9 seats
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have a lead in the city councils in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - see above.) already has an idea of the general elections, whether there is an increase or not, the number of elections is more than positive.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to be held, the PPC could also get 12 MPs in the House against the current 8, the party of the Unconverg (Cycling) and the Unconverg (Cycling).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the parties of the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would have lost one MP - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would still have one mandate, or another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next round will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the socialists in the four main provincial cities, as well as on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona), which is one of the millionth years for the largest 6 presumed.
Both the nationalists and the people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona office - since it is necessary to get at least 5% of the votes.
The PP party has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the revolution in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The people also won in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
The PP currently has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell has provided the Al-Qaeda organization with thousands of passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were arrested in 2008 by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, constituted a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaida, among which were also "Tigers of Liberation" in the "Tigers of Liberation" there.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of Al-Qaida's counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "thus limiting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that this cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida, so that their "fighters" could pass through the countries in impunity.
This shattered cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that similar interventions will not take place in other European countries in the coming days, such as the one in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Sij Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), the Atsana and the Atsana developed behind Mu, in Thailand, and the Atsana were behind him.
It was these men who were driving a cell from Bangkok, based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, have to be valid for several years and be without visas.
The investigative documents stress that there are no known facts linking the detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and later in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "put" to buy cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "team", which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) calls on Masov to halt fiscal deal
President of the PPC (Catalan People's Party) Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camachov<0xC3><0xA1> had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Masa her terms and conditions under which she is willing to promote his appointment as President of the Generalitat; these terms and conditions are the same as those proposed by the nationals during the campaign and their priority is to revitalize the economy.
The president of the Catalan People's Party came to meet with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs to take his position to at least one of the formations that make up his position.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain when the general elections are held, but so far the talks that he is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to gain her support for her inauguration, "she will have to end all sovereign and libertarian speeches," as well as the economic agreement - similar to the Basque one - which the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to reduce the overcrowded political apparatus of autonomous government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the appointment of Masov will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The Olot Center shows do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to identify the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this house for seniors Joan Sala appeared in the company of the facility's lawyer, Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat's house would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legitimacy and responsibility oblige us to leave the process to the authorities."
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not uncover the criminal activities of the carer in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat are now claims for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of the home for the elderly with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor looked at the deceased in person, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled by phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any way be the cause of what happened".
Lawyer La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party other than the accused himself would have committed an error."
A man now dubbed the "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and said he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed the second elderly woman a month and a half later.
in this case, caused death by administering too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when using a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control the access of staff to drugs.
Insulin and a sedative cocktail were probably used in six out of nine cases by this caregiver to kill patients in an effort to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now underway in the laboratory should show whether Villa is not lying and was actually looking for his first victims' less cruel death or, on the contrary, killed them by administering louse, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of deaths may be higher than the one he confessed to, and they justify their behavior in the various versions that the Villa submitted to the court with the knowledge that they must change their actions when it became apparent that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The margin differentials closed by force and the shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although falling, is recovering – but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take a while for the investor to lose his anxiety.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would take its liquidity rate back today, and tomorrow it will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy back the government debt for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "at least until March" and to comply with a three-month bid with unlimited access by the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If they fail to meet the expectations created, it will re-create the reaction of yesterday’s markets, and if they continue to blindly continue to draw down the level of liquidity, God is with us!
It was the same at a convention in May, where they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse in the markets - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armor fist announced it on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought a lot of them, causing another market crash.
Yesterday's one-year tender in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, in Portugal, the rates fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in market sentiment that took place after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, figures representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after not revealing the problem with stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the contingency plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by parliament, and it still does not have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease the tensions in the face for the next EU summit on 14 December, when a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like Four seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market has grown by 4.5%, twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction that will be favored by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in high demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing ability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40 billion in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would shut us down sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to appear that".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the Vega Sicilia negotiations requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the family of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, is not silent.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge the legal proceedings of El Enebro, which are scheduled for 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, after which they should try to force their majority and seize the company with the help of the Boga's administrative authorities.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the domination of a part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not seem willing to settle his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
five of its seven descendants were removed from its administrative committee, who were appointed by the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro trial scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was summoned by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has once again restored the thunder in the womb of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s Mezquiriz sees David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as “a desperate means of his five children serving through judicial deception and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the conduct of January 18, which was completely invalid.”
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this act as "completely irrelevant".
The very protagonists, who are quietly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to have the court convene in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, the seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez own 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when resolving the question of a judicial challenge of proceedings. The date of this resolving has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibility of this new team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso’s triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of a Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful march-simulating software, which the German company launched in 2007 for purposes very distant to motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce a product or simulate a process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled the Red Bull team to carry out “within hours, in near real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with high-performance information technology to analyze and design every type of race car modification.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except for the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical capability is the maximum amount of $40 million that any Formula One team can spend in any period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology facility about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project consists of 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is undoubtedly the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, behind the immeasurable technological means that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in race circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and no one knows them.
Steve Nevey, head of manufacturing technology, says it was possible to say five years ago that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was due to riders.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP to establish 20 own stores in two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Spanish Vice President of HP Helena Herrer has given an example of a newly renovated store on Barcelona’s Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s HR systems, has assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have the industry’s experience and knowledge.
The North American company here advises with the exclusive design of the equipment of the stores (with products that can be tried interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with securing staff for stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to “improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized businesses in purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging”.
The business in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program that aims to address any issues with warranty-based computer devices.
The online service is connected to the technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“Then we’ll be able to solve problems that could otherwise take up to two days in 10 minutes.”
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrer.
Sabadell Bets It Will Steal One Million Customers From Its Competitors In Three Years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to a passive war.
However, it expects a reduction in interest rates, which, however, will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to be able to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public assistance in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, respectively, deducted from those who may leave the bank - because until now the ai Institute has rather hugged large and medium-sized enterprises than small and medium-sized enterprises.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in terms of private clients is 3.5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs, the challenges of which will be shown by the bank when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world’s banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension to the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
Guardiola insisted that the year 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be long".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that a passive war — which lowers margins — is receding, the price of the surcharges on the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, offsetting the lowering of margins.
“The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.”
"We haven't closed the faucet yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is reducing commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not in vain to assure that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
“Next year there will be no stone left on the stone,” he said.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "much reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can replace fundraising on the market with a new capital measure.
After reassuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers of savers
The Director-General of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savers, and once again insisted on the speed with which the sector is being reorganised.
When the process of associating Spanish savers started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a new wave of such operations yesterday.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is the conventions."
"Most of it is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the director said.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of the leaders and executives of the Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n), Olavarrita explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the plans of the trade, which were made in the past, not now, by the banks.
"Going from 45 savers with an average asset volume of 28 billion to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has never been compared, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not-so-happy views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be on time before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and condemned those who question it as "lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savers, as well as a system that has managed a "very important" process of concentration and that continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has come out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private mediation agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of the AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - see Eljas and Bar.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, on the other hand, joined criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which hints at the idea of respecting old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the brand - although now it may seem like a sci-fi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time now, so there is no room for outliers.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission instigated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform from its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be right (fiscal rigour and public finance stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel painfully stretched the decision to rescue Greece.
Already at that time it was the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear opinion when she demanded to reform the European Union conventions so as to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time that private creditors have an obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and we should be monitoring the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should allow these measures to take effect from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although measures need to be taken now, with which he seems to disagree very much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone in which violating states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report deferrals, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is suggesting that we need to take a strict path of growth with increased rates of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on receivables and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as reigned in the boom years of Spain’s growth, they simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace greater calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that they give us in the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his two-pronged statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the way has opened up to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has outlined is there, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not very serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and circumvention of rules
Finty, as shown by Alonso and Ramos in a match with Ajax, shows the wit rather than the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 has caused the sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is non-sporting behavior, and whether or not UEFA should be able to state both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won) the named players one by one deliberately lost time at the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in their group lead - and will be able to, stripped of cards, continue to the next stage.
In the end, UEFA's disciplinary committee awarded coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking the yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethic of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten but are followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the Real Madrid team (which boasts of nobility and honor in its anthem, and which has already penalized its players for similar acts), and apparently also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds to his long history of the comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts circumvent the law; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, which, of course, may make sense.
It is decided what type of damage such actions cause to the sports spirit.
One of the necessities of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, that is, there has not been a violent game.
Another of these necessities that characterize a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which is not the case here.
So the paradox of Real Madrid players’ action is that what we normally characterize as a deception or circumvention of the law did not occur, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as visible as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The next question, however, is what advantage the perpetrators of their intentional transgression will have.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that in the current match there is no benefit, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this action, the players will refuse the penalty, and move to the second round of cards, in which it is enough to exclude one card less than in the first round.
So as the bikes continue, it is not entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, part of which is to make strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, the players were not intended to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without escaping punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between cunning and circumventing the rules is not quite clear, I believe that it was clearly a cunning in this case.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions for provoking them from the leadership were transmitted.
Damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
The fight of offers for the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar concentrates an avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a growing celebration of employees who want to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties are coming again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but due to the crisis they have resulted in a struggle to gain customers by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend from 20 to 30 euros on food.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated requests for the week from December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for days at the peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the thin years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay their spending on parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the portability limit, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities at this time does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before they make a reservation."
“They want to get out, but when it comes to pricing, they’re careful,” he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who will offer quality and good service at a favorable price," he says, recalling that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down the ladder and most customers now want to spend around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25.
A survey of various facilities shows that the biggest rush of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in bookings this Friday, with the most requests being for spending up to 30 euros, thus adapting the menu offered, the total prices of which are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, Andilana, counting 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought a peculiarity of this year's calendar more early bookings since the beginning of November.
“We have made it possible and impossible to maintain last year’s prices, and our menu, which everyone should choose, ranges from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.95 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.”
The AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remain optimistic after seeing an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources stress that December 18th will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations will take place among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noted the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - see above).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which again invite their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is somewhat larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has "resurrected", although clients "concur to the maximum".
This impression has not fallen even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused a major upheaval in the United States
“Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks documents confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that is arousing in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and important details they offer regarding the content of communications and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is not going to make a state of retreat," and that this "is not going to be a stable one."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored in pieces to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in one report before the visit of then-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the nuclear material."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the program of guided missiles is no longer observed not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a widespread and presenting reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with a strict religious belief to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or programs of guided missiles," Yuri Korolev, an expert with the U.S. Department of State for Foreign Affairs, told Reuters.
The biggest novelty of the documentation published by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-lower cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A dispatch issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as no other country in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to make “very clear” during General Ashfaq Kayani’s visit that “the Pakistani military must end its silent support for terrorist groups.”
Searching for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking anti-terrorism official to avoid new information leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary call", the so-called "red notice", to "locate and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but rather with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks lawyer Mark Stephens said: “Police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on November 20, when an international police force based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange “in order to establish a temporary bond with him and issue him.”
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by the red appeal, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notices to allow arrests to be carried out - this should be ensured by the national police component - in particular where states have a bilateral agreement.
The move was outraged by Assenge’s lawyers, who yesterday published a piece claiming that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks had expressed a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via a videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt and not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations and thus violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the demand as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed senior anti-terrorism official Rusell Traverse to prevent further leaks.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views of conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, asked the foreign ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations “so that anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise assist them can be targeted and prosecuted.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to resign.
"Obama should put a reward on him or use an unmanned aerial vehicle or something."
The one who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in government, anyone responsible for leaking information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC by "flashing" on Caroda's supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe for how to fight the several internal revolts in the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia - see above), unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his gesture of demise seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as that of his leader himself, and that he can absolutely not do to him the cares he had for his country.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms by twitching, which will help him turn to the municipal elections.
First, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee will be able to speak secretly about his stay in office.
By using ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carod's supporters want to pass a criminal vote on to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid a split and subjugation of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage, that he would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at the congresses.
But given that they do not have a sufficient majority to force a demise, they will try to remind the executive about the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will be able to vote on to the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for promising to relocate Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-voice" damages stability, and that his goal is to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a distinctive article that current adviser Josep Huguet has signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’s ideologue, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed “in exchange for several goals.”
He appointed five of them, two of whom stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also including new faces, which are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should end entirely by meeting as a mechanism of functioning.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that it is possible to hold congresses through delegates selected by vote.
Termination of the meeting system model, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s’ team, which has fought in this direction already at the last two congresses.
However, the tumultuous assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this issue.
Now, without the looming critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine the matter and try to close it down once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 killed in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, the daily MILENIO reported.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the past month, there have been a total of 390 deaths in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a dead body in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, followed by a blow from mercy to the head, and had arms and legs tied by rope.
The next day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning, on Thursday, November 4, the teammates discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots into the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a fifty-year-old man was killed by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were shot in the head in San Pedro Xalaxtoc, Ecatepec County.
A body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony in Chalco, and a 25-caliber gun cartridge was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The rescue teams searched extensively for other parts of it, but did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported the discovery of a body with hands tied behind it and a curled head on the site of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the stud.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bedding and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza was reported, and death threats were also found among the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz district.
in a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the village of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan, a man was found killed wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was identified by his premeditated murderer as R.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla with no signs of life, with two wounds to the stump.
On the skin of the woman, a tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - see above) was discovered, as well as necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found and a report was also found in them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found that bore marks of torture and had tied limbs, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the colony of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was cut and found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with tape and had a message left with him; while the second was tortured and was found in a plastic wrapper in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
He and the agents found a ticket with the report.
China Adheres to Its Goal to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The country’s representative at the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 said his country had made an extraordinary effort to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it is insisting on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% in 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stressed that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programs.
In all these points, they have already noted progress, including last year’s approval of the new energy law, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-year plans are in progress or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been put in place over the past five years and which has received investment from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial project on climate change is also underway, as well as a project to replace bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and a project on mitigation and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than widely thought.
For example, he explained, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Lawful Exclusion of Espin: César Nava
The national president of the PAN party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech National Action Party - see above) said that the former president of this party is entitled to apply to the National Commission for the Order of his right.
The National President of the PAN party, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal and that the former president of the PAN party is entitled to turn to the National Commission for Order and demand his right.
In an interview prior to the objection by State Governor Gabin Cué Monteagude, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the National Council's Commission for a decision taken by the competent authority," he added.
He also explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the Alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
“This [2012 alliance] is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an intention for a local election that was successful and met its purpose,” he said.
He said 71 years of dialogue were on his side, and that is why "we are not afraid of internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and it strengthens us."
He said that the committee will be able to choose the best chairman or chairwoman that PAN deserves for the next three years without debate, so he will hand over the relay to "whom the committee appoints".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to whichever of the five I am proud to hand over the office of party president."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections would be reflected in future elections, although "there is still no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this regard, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the object of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be the subject of these
When asked about the criticisms of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, see above) for his speeches during the four years he is in power, César Nava invited members of the PRI to reflect on the six-year-old periods of Carlos de Gortari<0xC3><0xB1>as and the former presidents.
"If the PRI thinks that the Zedilla and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n governments, then let them start defending them, let them climb out of their utensils," he said.
He stated that the head of the federal executive branch has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, since no scourge or censorship is used in this country.
Obama Proposes Twitter Law to Support Undocumented Students
“If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass this bill,” Trump tweeted on social media.
President Barack Obama joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents, by posting on his personal Twitter account.
“If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass the bill,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report highlights an internet link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to immediately contact the senators as the vote on the bill approaches.
"As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other drafts, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to compile a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of the other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a "debate vote" on the Dream Act so that a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, although it is more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years, and were admitted to a higher education institution or to the military.
But the proponents need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of a few Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are conducting intense agitation to ensure that the bill is passed.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, the Dream Act supporters need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as retired Florida Senator George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but have said they will not back it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet made a statement.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature insert a finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "to insert a finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "to hit a nail on the head - see above)
The second round of the Pleasure from the Language cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and under which the question was used as a tablecloth in this language.
The finger to the punch "brings us to the narrow", said the Argentinean writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this debate at the round table.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celori, and which Schultz then described as a great story, in which she portrayed Luisa in the first person as a protagonist, who in search of knowledge of what a "stroke" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get an answer.
From the infectologist goes the conviction: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really open, and that's the symbolic scar".
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she only learned so much about the wound that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she became convinced that pleasure and convulsions in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also performed a delightful narration, which he called Praise the Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one point appears.
with elements of magical realism tells about the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back the people who went far, or corrected the honor lost by a virgin, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel in which the sculptors, from the beginning they did not miss it, the sculptor, the sculptor of his own.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, ridiculed the fake testimonies that were presented in the stories as real, but in no other way was he ever able to tell the story of America with such imaginativeness that even shame was lacking.”
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and it is precisely where reality merges and lies, where it is no longer known what belongs to one group from the story and what to the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the “Cervant tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her word Finger to the Wound enabled.
The Cuban-Portuguese writer has pointed her finger at the great wound of social violence that passes through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
“I think good literature, good poetry, and good songs make a silent compromise, which of course is not intended,” she said after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciousness, which overflows dogmatisms, he forgets that "behind every attachment there is a small no and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality we must color: and to color means to put a finger in the wound many times and to annoy those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without color, and to annoy the authorities who prefer this."
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve on three occasions in the decisive series.
in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles distinguished by their techniques, teams that have a clear difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he managed to achieve already on three occasions in the decisive series, but until now he left with the undefeated, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to settle for a silver medal, remained one step ahead of the winner and curiously played with the same team in the following final.
As a coach, the Santis strategist made it to his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he was in the hands of Morelia, with whom he fell a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it to Ray with a total score of 3-1, which was against the team.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 11 Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, he scored three goals against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzen<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>" (a.k.a. Deportivo Toluca - see above) after a draw of three and a draw of two after a draw of 210 minutes.
Rubén has already lost two finals against Toluca's "Red Devils" and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in living memory has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we have learned that until the referee writes the end, we can not celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalties, we were not ready to run in, we were ready to run in, we thought
It does not bother him that this series could be decided in the shootouts, we are not afraid, he trusts his players: "We never tried to get to a series of kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and we need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready for the shootouts, in the last tournament we
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The United States changes the rules for granting visas
People will have to turn to the Service Centres for visa applicants before interviewing the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa negotiation process at the U.S. embassies and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Services Centres (abbreviated from the English ASC) before interviewing the Consular Department.
ASC staff will collect the biometric information of the applicant and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, you will no longer have to pay a fee for the appointment, the second for the processing of the application and the other for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for merchants and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular official, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time there than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an additional $26 service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1pm by experts on astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of the origin, evolution, diffusion and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited reporters, NASA assured that it would introduce a “discovery that will cause a break in the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature uses arsenic in some way for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will announce the real scope of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explores Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartisanism," they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term had not even begun, when the opposition bloc was formed in the Congress, led by the members of the PRD parties (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tica, Czech "Party of the Democratic Revolution" - see above), the PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Party of Labour" - see above), the Converg.
Before the start of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of the Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo had been "warming" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as he dismissed them.
With this reform, they repeated, “bapartism” begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brit from PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech "National Action Party" - see above) and Luis C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas vice-president F<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms constitute institutionally political marginality from the push of the parties PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjugated by these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When I get here [the opposition coalition], I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they don't even have the will to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergence said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and will therefore form a plurality group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after it was monopoly, was now "duopol".
The aim of law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
The group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez added.
PT’s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that at the moment Congress has become a “benefit” of two – in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"Before it was controlled by only one party, today it is divided into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked that the honourable Member's personality be respected and that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"So that the five MEPs, who are probably already nine, but are now seeing us in five, did not leave us because of the vicious agreements outside, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that we have formed, we have not met and we have met."
A further 200,000 pesos are issued for "supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Hall will pay another check to the owner of the company that supplies the electrical equipment.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the mayor to Lorena Guadalupe Camacha Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in this second half of the year by the owner of the company supplying the electrical equipment will rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall's transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued in the amount of 200.144.56 pesos and as its subject was stated "the settlement of unpaid payments".
Registrar Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, who was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, an additional amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall owes her, and how many more checks will be sent in favor of Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, it only pays what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that she had not used the services of the town hall supplier again.
in the past, after July 25, the newspaper Noroeste published a revision of the cheques issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 42 million pesos.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Touristic places in need of maintenance
Tourism managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada area in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist crashes into a deep hole in S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asks authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, not showing the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad thing that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea of revenues that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to focus on preventive maintenance, not just correcting existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve clean housing, the town hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city. "
There are also other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of the deer - see above).
"In today's time, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city flooded with cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention was not paid here and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, sub-secretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, which, however, will first need to be put in order to attract these places and to be able to put them on the list that we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Davalos, the president of the CCE, would like MPs to take great responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is struggling and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, to make commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and not to repeat the same biased and paternalistic patterns.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the road to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their rights, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary overlaps that would move the ruling party forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and to be committed to society and the sectors above all because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all forces in order to achieve the economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation."
As for tourism, he called for new legislators to give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is the Ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currencies and investments, which in addition directly compete with agriculture."
In addition to spending money on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help secure the state and help with the Alcohol Act, which failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for the Three Kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles are along with other toys on the wish list of children in the Coronada Valenzuela family.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their imaginations about the upcoming Three Kings holiday, as their household counts exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as his father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... I go out on the street in the afternoon and sell them on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would love a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfred, he'd been wanting a monster car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana would have wanted clothes the size of a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I said 'we'll see the son,' because it was very expensive."
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal clothes and shoes.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size 12, ten-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he would really like a pair of size five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronada Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and bring a gift or cash at the reception of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
“Approximately 750 pots of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and the equipment used to produce it were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom are alleged to be the heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to arrive at the Sherbrooke courthouse following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, its possession for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were subsequently carried out after a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public and that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers from the Estrie Regional Investigation Unit of the City of Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will clearly be defeated, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, surrounded by lawmakers after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as drafted, a law that would allow the detention of up to one year of any person originating from a ship identified as a ship carrying an illegal immigrant, would violate Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading for the wrong goal.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD critic Olivia Chow, on the issue of immigration, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against illegal immigrant smugglers and that is what we consider to be the bearing part of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it places blame on refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are taking Canada to flight and treating it like some kind of patolisal.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every MP who is against would be held accountable for their position before their constituents.
Unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying not to forget this idea: Quebec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement was a surprise for many of us.
It should be noted that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, it was not necessary for PQ's public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron to rate the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and an "amateur solution to the knee".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for having witnesses interrogated in public.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is asserting that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, which they allow to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's government documents.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this charter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected biker groups, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
The rivers are under close supervision.
Several streams have come under tight control due to heavy rainfall, which has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road is slippery.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
From 20 to 40 more millimeters were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
It could fall a total of up to 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitations to the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
Quebec's emergency services issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday night.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentides, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, became the subject of flood emergency and continuous control.
In the area of Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re, heavy precipitation caused the dilution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn as a result of heavy rains.
The two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the flooding of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency response and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Center issued flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup, on Wednesday.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as, gross speech during broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians".
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council has received a number of complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Joint Front of Beneficiaries of Social Assistance.
The group complained that the amounts stated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of 'Dupont's Lunch Reports' have come across a sensitive topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no rebuke made against him.
The latest dispute was over the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort got into a media shootout, which provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any donations to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the money needed will actually be received.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of Haitians.
"I've already done my three-day postponement of the thing."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use rough language in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "above its responsibilities".
For a station that will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences will be minimal.
King of the kung-fu of Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange time.
The athlete, who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters the tatami and rings of the world and looks for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for matches pretty much everywhere, because for those who don’t like the ground-based game that appears in martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and as an assistant to UPS, just delivered bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"Invited were the competitors who finished in the first four at the last World Championship in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I finished in the tournament at five in the morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be the first at this rate this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where fist and foot strikes, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, descended from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
However Nacer Zemmal has only one result to keep in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in kung-fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's kind of equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category compete to be crowned the only champion, the kung fu king."
450 million contracted without public competitions
Hydro-Québec has agreed, by mutual agreement, to $450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium created by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project in a total amount of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was authorised in 2004, in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to entrust its responsibility for the management of this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project to the private sector.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint about a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's a new way to implement the collusion and eliminate the competition."
"This means that people, who no longer make side agreements in secret, are now doing them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard posed this question to the National Assembly, because he says that it is difficult to bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, this afternoon, strongly denied that this contract was a collusion.
“I have my own path,” she murmured, claiming that PQ was “dishonest” and “missing accuracy.”
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise to respond to a call for proposals for a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the scope of work.
Construction is underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, not even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the consortiums in the field of engineering consulting is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we cross the Quebec business register at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created forever.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, leads to the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the Energy Manager consortium, Minister Normandeau underlined in particular the fact that "the territory of Baie James is typical of a particular workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to shake our heads over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few contestants bidding, your bids may be higher."
“You have two choices: you pick up the people who are in that contract as contestants, and you say, ‘Let’s make a deal that’s satisfactory and at a good price.’
"But the main idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Manager Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for engineering consulting, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories, performing analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, of which Génivar had 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Energy gerance".
All contracts have been closed.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with Energie gérant at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal parties of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also affiliated with companies that "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about its management staff.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not encourage trust
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in "unbiased" labels and eco-certificates, to follow suit when choosing products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy into the media universe, which urges us and encourages more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, non-performance of obligations, which qualifies even as a brake on its commitment.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them do not trust them very much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe the promises of companies about the environment, simply because green advertising companies are figuring out a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates affixed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, Barometers said.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is taken as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems to be paramount to stimulating this consumption site revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers at present.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
By the way, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the data we provide about the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
As many as 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants in their neighborhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, according to Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre.
More "green" and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year -, Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving for the least possible impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental consciences apparently remained somewhere outside their car, according to the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or recommending using a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of protecting nature.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company Angus et le Parallele, which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and demonstrated its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it asked for.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would, by the way, be lower, some original expectation that could lay the foundation for a viable solution under favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for $12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and the action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centers in Quebec opposed the state’s direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas during ten years of filmmaking after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could have been the reason for a change by the state financial council.
The lack of halls for independent films is rampant in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, believing it will hold $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of three film companies, Le Parallele, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to screen Xavier Beauvois’ most beautiful film Men and the Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and thus ignores himself, he and his group are thinking about the proposals for reductions that are made to him.
Raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New U.S. diplomatic sources reported through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadians’ inferiority to Americans, but also reveal their sense of superiority to the latter.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government to pass its 2009 budget!
Four new reports, including from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released to the public yesterday, also provide sensitive details to get each other under the skin.
The communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details at what point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives several explanations for this situation.
“Canada’s quasi-stubborn inferiority complex presupposes perhaps political leaders to talk about domestic bets instead of realizing that these elections also concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is therefore a proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better the party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to elections."
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be found in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure that the government remains in a vote of confidence in early February, regarding the federal budget to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, over a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament in order not to be defeated by the coalition, and that opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative image that is being cast on the United States by dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are not too ingenious references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent CIA interrogations.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it reads, "he handed over some paper relating to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the Secretary of State."
"Secretary agreed to revise the file."
Finally, note that people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
It was announced and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
In Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n, the United Nations has proposed a plan to restore home lighting, retail lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, which correspond to almost one-third of the additional limit that needs to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from 2020 onwards.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact bulbs or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DELs or "LEDs" in English), a substantial amount from 1.8 billion e.m. to Gt would be replaced by GES.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GHG emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to achieve by 2020 stabilization of warming to 2 degrees Celsius to rule out not getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, we reduce this consumption by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, which Philips introduced this week into production – this company allegedly participated in a UN study – have an estimated life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a lighted bulb, giving us an idea of a possible savings with a land-recovery plan that would apply in the next 100 years.
All of these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collection plants.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact bulb, but rather a thermal coal-fired power plant, which emits a lot of mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants produce 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the gains that each country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year to buy electricity and $8 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost $2.5 billion to build.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the elections.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate publication of the results of the Ivorian presidential election after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay," the statement said.
"It calls on all parties and institutions in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let its last date — Wednesday midnight — expire, without announcing the results, three days after Sunday’s turmoil.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday, around the world, calls for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council for a "fraudulent" vote in the north, administered by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, confirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of voters practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of President C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire from going to vote.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
Its allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because it knows it has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after it prevented the election commission from transmitting the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivory Coast political group that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended up in the first round, Oct. 31, as a winner with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, as per the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilized to 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has further escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is 482,000 people over 50 and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published its monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste management companies and a brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into public contracts allegedly fraudulently acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misusing the company's assets, misusing public funds and public property, concealing, providing bribes, receiving bribes to influence the office and holding ammunition, his lawyer said.
“Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions that he intends to ask him, not some delusions.”
"It's easy to prosecute him for many punitive reasons, but it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini, through his lawyers, stated that he had sent a brief message to the judges before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of anything like this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was accused on Wednesday of misusing public funds and conspiracy, and left at liberty, under judicial supervision with a ban on contact, the protagonists of the whole affair.
"My client was able to explain all the facts that are being exposed to him."
“The investigating judge is watching over this and will leave him at liberty,” said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released on Wednesday night, with two of them under judicial supervision, prosecutor's deputy Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one with "theft and misuse of society's property", the other with "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "hiding the misuse of the company's assets".
Among the persons confronted by Mr Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged with a concurrent case of fraudulent public procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted in the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in waste matters.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the municipal community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysee Palace exaggerated Syria mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "espionage", unified views in France, led diplomacy into combat readiness and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young Frenchwoman was not a compensatory measure against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the American judiciary for the illicit trade in material in favor of the Iranian jader.
Finally, they highlight the way the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
The Elysée Palace’s advisor for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking to the U.S. diplomat Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do just as much for him to be transported back to his homeland by his own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously pronounce the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate liberation” in the media.
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it the more the more they will ask you to stop doing it.”
Because attempts to negotiate through discreet channels have taken place, “silence will not solve anything”, the Iranians are “masters of avoidable maneuvers”.
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
The release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she is granted refuge by the French embassy) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230,000 euros).
And they will announce that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will be exacerbated."
“In the future, the Iranians could arrest an additional 1,800 French people living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but is still locked up in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is chasing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France entered into negotiations?
The liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he said, was not only "surprised by the judge's decision" but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There have been talks between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The adviser of the Elysee Palace dials the phone number, hangs the phone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of the arrest of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized "slaves" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influencing" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears its fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The August 25, 2009 telegram evokes the media "blast" of French officials.
What is the basis for such a degree of "gratitude", expressed to Mr Assad, is being asked by the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication “directs towards validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labelled premature and unearned."
By “exaggerating the role of Syria,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can deserve when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the grain of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On 11 August, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided in him: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we still thanked them."
“This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysee Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival" that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, responsible government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies running online games to block access to these games after midnight for people under 16 years of age, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are not able to lead a normal life during the day.”
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior ministry official who oversees the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the responsible worker added.
It also gives free programs to people who request it, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee set up on Thursday the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a selection of sovereignly politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risks preceding the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 FIFA Royal Competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 World Cup will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its 2010 African continent premiere, or continue its deployment to the United States or the Far East.
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the whole world economy and the scale of the economy.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of a revelation leading to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have thus destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of the kick-off, which so far hosted the World Championship only once a year.
The BBC put a crown on it on Monday when it aired a document that "pushed on a pin" three influential members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA dissatisfied and bring into trouble the English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes he will be able to repeat the move that succeeded his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win the London Olympics in 2012.
Will this intense activity suffice for England to add a new shine to its name at the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spanish-Portugal pair do not miss the trumps of already prepared stadiums,his goodwill (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the murky economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move the championship to Zurich and has publicly declared "indecent competition in the preparation of the vote", in word hints barely turned to accusations of the English press against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We will throw them in the mud, we will try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their considerable 1994 experience.
The world’s highest-performing economy, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies appear to be premature for the two countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 World Cup is awarded to China, which is ardently looking for FIFA, has rendered Asia's 2022 chances invalid.
With Qatar pulling out the big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could snag at the sleazy TV charges (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: Evidence (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate to the Elysee Palace summons someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously it is not in good agreement with the share in the secrecy associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts were constantly persisting.
In one sense and the other.
In 2006, without believing it, Jacques Chirac’s friends made demands that the third term should not be ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that "he will decide sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As UMP members of parliament recalled on Wednesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" sowed little fever.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement, not a notification.
This is not the first time that he recalls such meetings with a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half years with me ahead of you," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His pre-Yesterday statements will not make him a candidate more than the day before; he will not make him a candidate less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to candidacy for the PS, on one side.
But that's not the entrance to Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal's club, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to stand trial.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat teams rather prematurely than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," the people from the immediate vicinity of the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Central Board of Governors in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European receivables binds, and the Securities Issuance Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation in the European securities markets already so tense today.
In such a case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in resolving the debts of European states.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I would like to extend my consideration to my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his interrogation of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in terms of his intentions, and satisfied himself with the fact that he said that "we will not see a program of buying state securities for a second."
The only certainty is that the European Central Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, Treasury purchases by the European Central Bank have doubled to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion in the past week.
And, due to the irrationality of the contracting parties in the market, yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts between market participants about the anticipation of continued purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the rate.
If the operation of loans for more than three months has already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unlimited provision of liquidity under generous terms and for a duration of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine that it would significantly change its program."
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering short-term new tensions,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, “the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the weakened market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposures of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It is necessary at all costs to compensate for the shortage of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the states that are among the most fragile," the senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, the more trouble it will be for states to reduce their debt, rather than stabilize it.
It is the saving of the euro at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi's backbone
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation has eased a bit, yesterday with the backflow of bond interest for 10 years.
A return to temporary tranquility.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy of the presiding regions, they said they heard Giulio Tremonti calling the situation "intractable" and that he was expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denounced.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from Germany’s long interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs rose to 263 points, causing some turmoil in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "the turbulent development of markets" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available to the Senate for its analysis, stands at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will account for another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new set of additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, the NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required by other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that elections could begin to be organised, which he expects at the end of March.
This would be the beginning of a period that is unsuitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
While all of this is relative, yesterday’s interest-related expansion on European government bonds brought water to the mill to governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Notation Office of Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the target most targeted by various speculations.
“Because in May, the real policy is insufficiently transparent and obvious, mainly based on banking systems,” said economists Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is running slower than market time.”
Aware of this disrupted context and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the ones most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their counterparts from the G20 are developing very well.
And this with regard to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin Group since the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (EFSF), its CEO, Klaus Regling, scheduled a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, in order to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this path is not aimed at increasing funds, it certainly prepares the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issuance of FESF securities is expected next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries in question in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that go hand in hand with fast-track measures.
Lisbon and Madrid have taken a different route than Greece and Ireland have taken.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, asking for international assistance even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain their lasting trust.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
While travelling to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the very first plan to trade in European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The Fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to date by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing transport difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and frost.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have an orange emergency, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snow tides cause problems in the north of the Gironde and Les Charentes and weak snowfall on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowfalls are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor coast, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods vehicles - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, police say, and the police recommend that you leave with your vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for the day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
There are no special measures for restricting freight transport on Wednesday evenings.
The district authority "calls on all drivers of cars to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the road".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their airline company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall 23 billion euros in the metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start the construction, the state announced a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
Theoretically, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its double source for contracts.
Today we are finally getting to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Correction Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and a tax increase from the offices at Ile-de-France.
The first, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favor of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The income from this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the offices, which already exists because of this, "to be modernized to increase the revenue generated from it and to make this increase affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Stupidity.
It is not numbered in the text.
We're a long way from $4 billion.
“It is specified that these fiscal resources are attached to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital grants that will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” we read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
“From the moment we create revenues, we can cover the study for three years and then go up to $4 billion,” he said.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP expects that 4 billion will be allocated only in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belongs to the still absent subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Revengeful Hackers and Insightful Scouts
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future controlled by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
Berlusconi’s “extraordinary revelations” about the way Americans live their sexual lives are reported by what anyone could read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi’s own), and the distasteful cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of reports already known is essential in the dynamism of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts is reluctant to search for new information (and does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret service (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy sent to the state prosecutor’s office was the same information that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
So why is there so much turmoil around the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can telephone or fly off for a joint dinner, has lost its diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in the transformation of the center.
Any viewer who watches the investigative films knows very well that it is only out of licentiousness that he seemingly ignores it.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly defames the duty of hypocrisy and throws a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information from the most powerful country in the world represents a hard blow, not negligible, to the prestige of this state court.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "performers".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, it was possible to grasp all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell’s prophecy has been proven ever since, that by being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, a citizen became a complete victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how things are going now, that even the “graves” with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of any hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circulation.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker – elected as a citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can one keep a power that no longer has the power to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the real secret is a non-content secret (and the non-content secret can never be revealed by him); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious non-content secret, because it is a non-content secret, because it is a non-content secret, as he has extracted it from the public life.
WikiLeaks made no mistake about Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on such a great power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would amount to its publication on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, it is useless to hope that you can keep a message secret over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive news be kept secret in the future?
I know that for the moment my forecast belongs to sci-fi and is fantastic, but I have to imagine the government factors that transport discreetly the fulfillment of formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry with them only those messages that know from memory or rather hide the rare information in the booth.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-closed drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wire-based telegraph.
Video cassettes (analogs) have allowed movie lovers to shoot the film step by step, move it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow you to jump through chapters, that is, macropores.
By high-speed trains we will get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the journey by plane and transportation that includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
The last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was envisioned in the secret of the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep promises for fast-start (or early-start) financing implemented by developed countries.
And big French hacks were uncovered
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report clarifying the action of its member states, a press conference, a grand side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued for its real value: advanced countries and civil society would like to see all advanced countries and civil society do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its pledge of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is realised without detriment to Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference year: international funding has remained and it adds another 150 million for the three-year title of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), it has to comply with its commitment to finance “new and additional”...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, think that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proved for some investments that are profitable (often it is projects associated with reducing emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , but we should not understand it from the point of view of our own.
But France can only give the following justification: it "observes" its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million, of which it makes 91.5% of the loan (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46% of the money, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) fulfilled their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the absolute majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfill its promise, it gives France only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
That's a beautiful piece of walrus!
In summary, in its "fast start" financing, France operates with double hedging: on the one hand, with the development of the stock in time and on the other with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it can convince that it spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although Bercy made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is only a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate debates.
But it could be a grain of sand extra in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its obligations and of decency and fairness vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term financing deposits (another key chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how to account for loans.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as with the others.
All hope is therefore placed in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
The alarm about pesticides that children consume.
A 10-year-old child will consume 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed issue," bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child in about a decade.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations – five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – as well as sweets, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are among the carcinogens, possible or probable, and five substances are among the clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as an interfering center for glands with internal mixing (PE), according to studies.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogens, and/or PE is striking," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as are about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, in which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steaks, canned tuna and even ham and gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water from the faucet analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The steak from the salmon for dinner was “the richest” with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of a plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not escape the analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this “contaminant cocktail” is likely underestimated,” the study concludes.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilisational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of them in cereals.
