The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange recovered the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since early Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the day’s collapse before it was nearly 6%.
Behind this downturn is the stock collapse on Wall Street.
Thus, also from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Collapse of stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks in the Asian Stock Exchange experienced a dramatic downturn, although the indexes, however, subsequently cleared some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cleared almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses settled to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect the financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong’s foreign exchange chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, thus without being dependent on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer the consequences as well.
The Massacre of American Actions
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system support plan, for which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a slump and major stock indices have seen the biggest crash in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar sized decline was last observed in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has yielded: the U.S. government can allocate $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have broken the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the American financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve trillion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor able to awaken the financial markets.
Later, however, we will have the return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, reach the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could take place again on Sunday.
Lawmakers’ delegates met Saturday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are in the process of finalizing the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
“We need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re here,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis relies heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in terms of time, the first to influence Monday’s market following the Congress’ decision.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can stop at the last minute on some issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, that is, to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, the price of which has fallen due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," the Republican senator said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciates “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the top spokesman, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget cuts, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for the executives of the companies participating in the program and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve taken a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the goal of lowering monthly expenses on installments for debtors and allowing it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“More importantly, this week Congressional representatives will reach an agreement on support for this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this point more important," Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It is clear from this that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason.
But if hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are the categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan probably hardly digests headphones from twenty crowns on the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is up to the battery life.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but cell phones don’t even do it by mistake.
There is no other device today that is as universal as a mobile phone.
Alongside the primary functions, calling and texting, it can read music and videos, record both, and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse, and maybe it can even browse.
And if we consider smartphones and handsets you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can do the grilling and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone and the earlier the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music takes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count on them lasting longer than a few hours.
If you still add, from time to time, some calls, get another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a recharge.
Another problem is when you download music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a media library sorted by performers' names, album name, genre, or by user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in the battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If the music you need above all from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can now be done on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats your phone or reader recognizes.
The MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by the Apple company and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something is in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always wear behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, among others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for the transmission of data.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, you fall into the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more progress, which mobile phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and the same price range up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Possibly
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There’s something missing here anyway – a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regularization of roaming tariffs perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who in the past sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, also often emphasizes.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (Otherwise, it might be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the market that has led to a significant drop in prices, which traditional operators should have reacted to.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices resonated in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can really succeed.
In the end, for example, we do not have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic it belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, it is enough for them to have far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not bear, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low cost, which is often in balance with the offer of the narrowest services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a group-target not recently.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
“Real men choose the Mobilking operator they like and can be trusted,” says David Seibertz, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland can also be affirmed by us.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“There is talk of the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the spokesman of the financial group Penta, said in a telephone dialogue for Mobile.cz.
Thus, it indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not very in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything because you do not create any potential competitors.
For some time now he has not concealed his interest in launching a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner it gets better it is.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
The unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, a wall of silence is erected around his creation.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has approached us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en<0xC5><0x88> of the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 press section said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokesperson Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
“On the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its 3G license requests.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most producer.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities -with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold to one thing they can row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the public access information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been enhanced above all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services.
However, the attitude of mobile operators is surprisingly disinterested by the Czech regulators.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that unfortunately in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS external relations section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead, on the part of the office that must defend the interests of consumers and above all take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services."
But, of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in <0xC3><0x9A>OHS’s interests.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the same price of gasoline for all petrol stations is certainly the fruit of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market to virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has - logically at the end of the day - the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum alarming that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS is kept out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recent update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one is watching
While without noticing it remains the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their mobile phone service price lists but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only preset people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company against the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about arise, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the terms of the contract, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they make a profit that is not indifferent and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns about possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it like the regular customers of mobile operators.”
But that should be a bit strange at the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another issue opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were virtually identical - market too small, limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries, in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened in defense not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves from one to the other the whole case like a boiling potato.
In our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw away the sponge.
If the behind-the-scenes information is right and the virtual operator will really soon appear from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC3><0xBD>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choral step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the hymn are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful inns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to make sure that both, and the choir, have a clear wording, that the text is well understood, that it is in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC3><0xBD>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh Theatre in Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl's original work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket instead of the paper ticket will board the metro, tram and bus.
At the moment, it can be obtained by about one hundred thousand people who have their own Opencard card.
Passengers can purchase the 30- and 90-day and annual (which will last from the first of January 2009) and at the same time have their card reloaded at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kabylisy, Rabylisy.
The coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget the counters at the subway stations where they had until now to make long queues for paper tickets.
The clipping is purchased via the Internet and on the Opencard they recharge it on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a staffed ticket office that will help those interested in purchasing on the Internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition, in libraries it will be possible to load electronic vouchers on Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cut, it will be loaded on top.
Electronic tiles are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from the number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to Prague’s integrated transport there are controllers with card readers with which they check the time and zonal validity,” explained the way of controlling Filip tickets by the Ropid organization, which fine-tunes Prague’s collective transport schedules.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the determined point next to the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the clips loaded.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the clips loaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cut expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where they load the coupons on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 called for <0xC5><0xA0>umava to be included in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This results above all from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "The people who hold the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their hearts."
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans only hope for brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to always assume the protectorate.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, oppressing and eradicating ethnic minorities and contributing nothing, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the supposed fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the domination of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem na<0xC3><0xAF>ve to our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czechs had little idea that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to see him for him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that once they got home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, living in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him, relied on the fact that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, expects this to deter drivers from dangerous behavior at the wheel.
The campaign of 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on the belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect the emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the slogan "bloody" of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his own life.
The commercials will "frighten" viewers until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
"With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass by red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
We need to remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that is why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, panels warning drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the Palestinians the same percentage [of Israeli areas], because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the scrapers or the flatteners to pass on to him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in the acknowledgment of the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people wounded.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is a prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism (Shiite movement) of Al-Qaeda (the precise terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can’t walk on the bus that makes long-distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua, the bus company Student Agency came up with the question of whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the way to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure seat of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake sharply even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the driving licence.
If it is not approved, passengers must sit.
Student Agency buses did not stop, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed on Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
It was later revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the seat assigned," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward’s role – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
Road traffic law recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," Hanzelka added less clearly.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law deals quite with this issue.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
It's all there," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing seats and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing seats with higher maximum speed and long-distance without standing seats with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
It’s not even safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can bang his head.”
"If the bus makes a sudden braking, of course the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be dangerous.
“As soon as I feel I have to consider the profession of steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
They would also reduce costs," he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, has justified the absence of stewards on his vehicles as an interest in security.
“We don’t have a hostess, we’ve been against each other from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88> died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got off the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the way to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats on long-distance buses, they are unbreakable."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewarts on buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered so much by buses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, who said that the police and security offices are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the bank of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a company.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the area of the Landesbanks.
So it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having long ago pointed out to the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the clients of the Savings Banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been talking about for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
In late August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house on Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka, half of which is led by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market trades or parts of them.
The conversations, however, as they say in the business square, have just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important companies in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this association of three nothing was done.
As soon as the plans were published, the regional bank of Hesse opposed Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved incapable of reaching an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought of us for a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is being created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
As the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank and Baden-Württemberg could take place first.
For Helaba, this is not entirely good news.
If you increase the pressure for other mergers, the partners will be missing as soon as possible.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of Helaba savings banks, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the chain link to the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic considerations are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be insured, would not yet be answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also emerge, which of course is not desired by the latter.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and shows to the about 200 travelers what are the deep tones that it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a hug and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, at the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with destination Munich, Festa della Beer" , expected arrival at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s not something for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver skeins belong to the buses.
Since 5 years they go to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The going at night, by day to the party, back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the rules of Bavarian authenticity, the sickness fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There is no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence in the bus falls, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plate on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left is "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Cooscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent means running!", quotes early morning Marco.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, or else we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!”
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. we'll meet again here!
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away the yellow caps to the trees, to the street signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the holiday, known as the "Italian weekend".
Exact data do not exist, we speak of 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Munich is reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the Tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
An expert in the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
After all, there are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had decreased by 95% to 2.37 million euros, even the share of equity has dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to 0 compared to last year, earnings from both increases in demand and certain shares as well as the settlement of provisions in credits fell by more than 70% over 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from interest repayment under the single text of tax laws and from business management for business consortia, negative profit has been fairly moderated by about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were dispersed into Aareal Bank.
Given that the income from traditional state financing was too low, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the affiliate’s value, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important state and infrastructure funder.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer deposits.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has largely dried up, because banks are accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs refinancing for a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – around 50 billion euros – in the short term.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a period of time and the company was protected from the influence of mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group will not need the money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still ensured.
This is hoped for by the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imbalances of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price fell 75% to 3.30 Euros.
Mortgage rates are pretty good.
While anterior-grade debts are almost immovable, they yield deferred credit rates.
The mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, understandably the proceeds with a maturity beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the importance of the Depfa the crisis has come to an end, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and least damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an annuality amortization by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding the information reversed due to the partial state-settings, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future compensatory tax payments on surpluses.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop, on the first day of school, is supposed to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new exchange log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
I was so excited.
I also had the fifa to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself and luckily I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been set as by us in Lower Saxony.
Schoolchildren arrive slowly from 8am until a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room", begins at 8.40am.
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who speaks willingly in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class sneezed, laughed, and waved, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii."
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I rushed to my place.
The girl next to me grinned, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson had continued quietly, but when she played the gong, I was attacked in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking messy and chuckling and asking me questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket - it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of wraps with meat and tofu..
I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me "
I have been reading Mangas for years now.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little bit of Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends -on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life.
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be that when they behave in our own way, they have the same feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years published articles of well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without which I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impractical territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, which means it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, it often connects the lateral prefrontal cortex with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should be presented in the way of speaking of man: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience due to the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness that science would find easier to access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we pass first to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
So what does it mean for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body’s reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
Talking nature creates subtle nuances of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings stem from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who, however, focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is likely to be felt with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger runs away as if he too felt the fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleobrains, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be shown to humans, how would you want to show it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is renounced.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continuously knocking against a wall.
I'm actually an emotionally practical person.
The President of UEFA Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
Both host countries pause in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work at the maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time.
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer from this."
Numerous first division players were convicted of manipulation only in the last season, and eventually the start of the league had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid rebounds indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has a crush on the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams with anger and rebounds.
The War of the Roses is delayed for former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors are now fighting with each other in a vicious litigation - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful.”
The extent of the betrayal she would come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul stripper" was the work with Ryan's press for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: he would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg once again repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "unfortunate" that Jack, the 16-year-old son they had together, would again "be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from separation, Quaid is remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family who is doing everything for the best.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels are dropping
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have again become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and travel American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter observed a marked decline in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, which would have led to a "slow desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the recession in hotel prices stronger than industrial centers like Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the prices of hotels with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still points up:
Due to the higher price of kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, prices for Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in Business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be, on the one hand, economic growth down, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, because of the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, there would be increased competition pressure.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the S.V. of Hamburg becomes chapolista.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first got into the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated precisely, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger said in the lobby of the Hamburg arena.
It didn’t happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them sat back in their place.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than certain old players.
And so his warning also found hearing in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Today, it wasn’t all good to see,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also “wanted to be more relaxed.”
For the 1st to zero, the Hamburgers must thank Mladen Petric (11) for his header and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not have harmed the weak players in Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol summed up.
SV Hamburg will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, spectators already celebrated themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in order," said Marcell Jansen.
He has the impression that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its newly hired late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily crash by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down recovered a little bit again.
Around 20:30 the world's most important stock market barometer has quoted/detected with a good 5% in the margin on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, it gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
Shares in Goldman Sachs have dropped by just 10 percent.
Just a few days before the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the rescue plan, financial funds had to be allocated for the collection of so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one go, but in degrees.
As a matter of fact, the State had to keep the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate price trend, in order to reduce the charge for the State's cash registers.
The course of actions in Europe and the USA in the vortex of the decline
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not erase investor doubts.
The share price of Germany’s big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling sharply and is tearing down the index of the German stock exchange
The American Dow Jones index gives us back despite the planned bailout of the financial market through the state.

The shares of the real estate lender in Munich have lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has yielded more than 20%.
The German DAX index slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
The global stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% out of 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges have also been able to only one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index has dropped by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.

Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, death for freezing now rests on her.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the / or Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical probe as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised scientists for years is that rockets do not behave at all as you would expect under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have observed in the cosmos.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her comes evidently a force of attraction, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers the abducted tourists in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release 6 kidnappers are found to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always on the lookout for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 components of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would be ready for the completion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them to their surprise.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would be "still just about taking over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women held hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to remain held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to take a position on the report.
The abuses of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise molested and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and that she had “died with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending: "I bound and bound her."
“I didn’t sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
“This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more difficult is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in front of the court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
“Otherwise it was clearly probable that she had been a promising and happy young woman of success.”
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on his way from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
“They will have thought that this was being treated internally at the Mod and Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq’s security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies deal with the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called upon to pay part of the bills of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction companies association, told the BBC he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home-grown market are now called upon to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pennies per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her a bail for extorting 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has called for the country's military-backed interim government to first give her total freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court's order.
"The high court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs the bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expects Sheikh Hasina to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government seized power, but was released in June to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of anti-polio campaigns in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The U.N. launched a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happens despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the decision of the Competition Commission to force the company to reduce its participation in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV casts doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin’s chief executive, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy, particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Prosecution Service to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to impede justice.
“Several allegations regarding potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or ascertained,” said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special public prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in legal action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud to the detriment of democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials were fired.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in dismissals, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to win the recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocals that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf — real name Marvin Lee Aday — has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely for use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the recently built luxury buildings on the First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the old manor district.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which controls the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the committee on land use of the municipal district commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city’s hands, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There may be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seating, including some to use for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this abandoned alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Housing, said it was in fact the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
“The terrain was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about East Village’s “gentrification,” opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost nothing changed city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end alley, dark even by day and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with sarcasm, with weeks-old newspapers hovering along the lowlands."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat was agilely running through the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer lying next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School."
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 math status exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and a “no excuse” attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to pinpoint which one it was.”
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools with English students?
The school’s results make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument trivial when he said people should stop worrying about “only-English” legislation.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil plummets sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again, amid tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety hit investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frenzied weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal “seems to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to ease.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets' uniform over the past eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a rebound.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the menacing clouds that overlaid them with a flaky game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get off my path," Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a wandering pitch and re-launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a fumble of Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had resumed the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 points without an answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested exceeds its world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile run under the 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie smashed his previous score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, running last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such an astonishing career that has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-cross-country skiers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He has been somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, counting on open road as if it were a mid-ground race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie competition after the opener vanished.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games to what is described as a bad accident, but was cured to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a large detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described – and that makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little of us, he doesn’t know what’s being lost.”
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very careful about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power-taking and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the blacks of the south - sometimes disdained, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through Florida’s often-forgotten downtown within a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Low as a grancasa in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow’s new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passage rooms.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Now she was saying it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston drove into the city, he used to arrive unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of decent clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others sighed.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on his chair on the patio at the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plateless tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community’s doorstep.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a coconut out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines such as: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't figure it out."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston hit the bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had once again turned the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it simpler: "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s self-image.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a revamped and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It’s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for Eatonville’s story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission asked in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things — such as murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields — they are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, no better, no worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they’ve just come in here, they’ll think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said after the mess on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, transporting muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
There did not seem to be a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the case so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s door,to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions for the Macy department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “trusted banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places where commuters work, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called thrift (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers like family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been subjected to controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a buyer who could save her.
The employees and culprits standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its ousted CEO Dick Fuld in complete familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge, almost fifty years old from my condominium, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I’ve changed, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals such as those of the road representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some tombs, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a spiritual search journey following its right-wing turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as linked to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the forefront by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel Abroad Banned to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to go to Spain through France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it provided judges with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, Paul Gadi's real name, was not present at the Ashford precinct hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “Thursday 25 September at Ashford prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd’s travel abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the registry of convicted sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have complete systems to manage each potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted persons for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he had to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have him switch to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge prefecture, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him on the sex offender registry.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheel, no clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatrical shots of some singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" they could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and of capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these great you do not need to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of the flamenco of Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery, at number 20 in via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is dealing with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has crossed the Amazon.
Ever-favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as by prognosis, the prominent figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’s book “Our Mutual Friend”, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience that has flown the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "I want to live beyond that"
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa emphasized, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has more effects" and that "it does not form people."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullrings selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has hardened against this festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bull race from taking place.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after touring with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than because of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the blockade in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers intimidate the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, give themselves up to escape.
Officers tampered with the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping they gave themselves up to escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
The officers went on the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and they took note once the van was inspected, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pancakes, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the license plate had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrestee was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as previously stated, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effect of Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to People magazine by a California road spokesman.
The witness specified that at around 4.30 pm the Locklear "scratched the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with sharp maneuvers back and forth. By going backwards, he passed several times in front of his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and that's why the agents took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has been collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been dismissed from the start, although "according to what was observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 7:00 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear had been released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been until now an adviser in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would commit. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposed in Sangre de Mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a TV miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of the history of 2 May.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a a "unique opportunity" to recreate the sets and costumes appropriate to portray a "stunned Spain that mistaken the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought to the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinando VII.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set design that he had himself signed with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Back to the Beginning, has influenced what is his usual working practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before filming together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and to the cinema to what is going on."
Many of the performers, some of whom are in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at this year's Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de Mayo, Siete mesas de billiard francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - should be the youngest generation of Spanish cinema.
From this film Garci is not expected prizes.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you settle for just shooting an extra film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer pays homage to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in the field of dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have loved to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible."
She says: “We don’t pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanghi.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also fits into this aesthetic,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as a face in "La puerta aperta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has accepted to work in my work and I feel very honored for that.”
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez "who has always played the role of eternal spa accompanist of these artists.
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, habitually, he resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who has had an enormous influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her, let alone considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will start today, at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theater.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta cie<0xC3><0xB1>ado" (Diary of a newly married poet) the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council on Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Fifth Anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ramon's letter" (2006).
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May in New York and which, after
In addition, the Council on Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the highest Andalusian poets.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It took a lot to get him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard shot for everyone.
"Sometimes what one proves goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so without virtue, and there are good people to admire, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdose to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, remarked that not a man died, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has left an example of the highest standard for all of us,” notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live the way Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and to have a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try it, and Paul Newman sets a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he certainly did not miss the opportunities not to be.
"Why am I going out for a hamburger today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicited grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A bunch of nonsense, which if they were later taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which presumed that it would go earlier.
It didn’t sound like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, I'm not.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after its tail), surprise! they only had T-shirts of size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inexplicable compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as was foreseeable, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in the correct order due to the chip that, I suppose, did not properly register the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft first introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move around the company's campus)
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen to and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group people into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist spots a third person, but understands that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at his disposal shortly.
All without blue screensaver.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less commercial garbage loaded, they would have to be five times faster — hey! Steve, it’s going to be for “the least.”
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps you need to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
It only takes the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and we spend more time surfing the web every day than in a remote, windowed environment.
What is the use of half of the operating system applications?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they constitute a valid alternative to Google.
They are in desperate need of it, in fact, and I give here a small example.
I took the photo included in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the web.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is punitive.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shining in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Il Padrino' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forsuit with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's T-shirt, with the cotton interior, tightened and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the English call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as a detail on the neck.
And beware, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
Also includes sweatshirts for college, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, mariner t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, she conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do this often.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, everything converges and there are many elements in common.
When I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to browse my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you deliver the wardrobe is the time when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
No, no, no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience of enjoying life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted when I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mother, right?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me to, and I also want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for some films shot last year to be released in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want to go to "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like it
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothes we showed – I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I who have known her for a long time can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Besides, I find myself with this good part you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it is to help the women of the third world, you can not pull back.
Drivers of relapsed alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if he does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he or she will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the Directorate General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Seguridad dell’Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once to drive in a drunken state then return to driving the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate their development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 1740, according to the program, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced her to use her hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or ...
- No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar crushed by the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 Navy soldiers offering the salute of honor.
The prince looks smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, windswept, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps she was told that in Mexico City she was threatening bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official team is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest in the city, a spirited Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan stylist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
Moreover, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the stylist Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite canvases of Chagal, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and in need of virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take away the breath and at the arm of his son Luis - a boy of almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of home and knighthood which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and shirt – drawn by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us a bar for the ballet savvy, he and she, she,
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had first shown us the photos of her son on his mobile phone.
The next day we were delighted with the presence of Olivier Martinez - another boy who moves by motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously ensured that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frantic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the fatigue of getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massages or “spa” treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a “menu” of options tailored to each’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this “manual” disproves that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but those children who talk staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquium.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the baby remembers nothing.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nighttime fears, nighttime enuresis (pissing in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overexcitement situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (crying, screaming, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g., if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What you can do, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to sleep.
Proposing quiet games and avoiding programs or TV series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleep talks appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advices
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to do him an interrogation to get information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he is saying but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that it might lead to.
Never tell your child that you could ask them questions during the night to learn their secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, do not worry, it is nothing serious, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory at home after a long and fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows have created the most net chances, turning one into the game’s victory.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves arduously.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain at the top and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for the well-positioned Illhaeusern, he resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not know how to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just backed up to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
Before the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to charm its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit is taking place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
Eliseo spokesman David Martinon said the president would “discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and secure working conditions and pay for sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections with Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula a roadblock was put in place.
On Monday, sailors already demonstrated their determination by burning tires and pallets at the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, starting at dawn, while taking up demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where twenty boats prevented the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantic, interrupted the blockade of the famous Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In the Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fishing Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel oil less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession that weighs on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG to divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, set up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would cede more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its business, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
There was no confirmation from the AIG.
The activities that the AIG intends to divest include the aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessions from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities take possession of 80% of its capital.
Paris: cronistoria Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday after the House of Representatives spoke out against Paulson’s plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) is higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank’s bailout plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, representatives rejected funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All this indicates how much the market counted on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying ... then the witness would be quickly transferred to the Fed (the Federal Reserve) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, the Pledge stressed.
Following the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have arranged the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Ten-year Treasury yields fell to 3.632% on Friday evening, up from 3.827% on Friday evening, while 30-year Treasury yields fell to 4.161%, down from 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama in favor of the first TV duel
After the first debate Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the victory of the TV duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that McCain’s performance, while meritorious, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks into the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s advantage on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
It’s a good idea,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undisputed foreign policy experience, emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" about the issues he faces at first hand.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What since yesterday constitutes a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without prolonging, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness for the right decisions and the intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproaching the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He didn’t even utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial crisis is in Obama’s favor, considered by Americans to be the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic insight to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming his intention to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's turmoil, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates shunned demands centered on the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While still waiting for the results, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some confess that they didn’t even vote: “What good will they do as much as they want, of my vote,” says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the voter turnout," said Yuri Potemkine, a spokeswoman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of 12 parties.
"It's a change of face," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because “dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don’t make any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the vote.
He points out that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there were elections?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient to power."
The night silence falls on the square in October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the blood scandal infected in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and public protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the resurgence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood collections and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she explains, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec had now confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports was, therefore, that when there are doubts about a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without a doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: tests for nucleic acid (TAN) that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to detect them has thus decreased significantly.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, that means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmitted by a transfusion to occur.
I believe that today you can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the Island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of Quebecers acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where it is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of scarcity are very rare.
But members of this group of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it is difficult to find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is abundant blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank insertion of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to have access to it," as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - L'Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the A-series, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday during a decisive second quarter-final match at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a first goalless time on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember that in the first round of the return game, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler finished a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Decisive network of Kovalev
The Canadien and his axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the win, in the fourth of Hab's preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory was the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to overreact in the first period, he noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation.”
Charest to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get himself elected in today's by-elections.
"Expanding the borders of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through tools of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image Mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister, by the way, refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but he did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the realization of future projects.
At the very least, he has limited himself to highlighting what he believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
That "twice the size of France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is ingrained in us,” he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Dresses, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government."
In addition, "considering climate change, we need to reassess the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful in this regard and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the PQ d'Ungava), have already started the consultation of some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has started work.
The prime minister does not rule out a "great meeting," not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would, after all, adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station at Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another conservative reference this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
“All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it,” he told his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He points out that he is certainly very busy, especially at a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will nominate members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the Northern Plan has been skeptical.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted up Quebec’s Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its implementation.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon candidate Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
“What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle,” said Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont’s replacement, returning from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (the irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who last summer declared that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, renounces its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We remind you, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the return of Omar Khadraffin so that he can be subject to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
We don’t realize it yet, but we’re witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy,” a word that Harper never stops extolling and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we have reached the moment when there is no morality anymore: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a minority head of government until today (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for the Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's the shame, Mr. Toews, of renouncing all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and managing director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar libel lawsuit against three authors and a small, squatted publishing house with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to stand up for a position contrary to his own.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a considerable sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically fundless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unequal gun battles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that obscures the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was first and foremost public opinion that should have presented its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with the exchange of opinions and not at the whim of a manganese.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misrepresents petitions and letters in support of Black Canada’s authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a “public debate” when his contempt for that same audience is obvious?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word only refers to the fragrantly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrationists have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports Black Canada’s authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilian exchanges of opinion, and not from the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of slur (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimatum by urging them to suspend the use of that parola...
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the complaint from Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss inconvenient topics for the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to replicate.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the academic world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb abusive desires.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, have finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of pledged houses for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection of salaries paid to managers of protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative to the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted like this, invaluable distress and unrest would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the U.S. presidency, who later joined the negotiations, were quite in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the deal, notably the one that will allow homeowners to maintain their domicile and the one about salaries for executives of state-owned businesses.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be happy about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, “I’d like to analyze the details, but I hope so.”
“Based on what I’ve read, it’s something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (mutui), then extends to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and results in the freezing of liquidity and the meltdown of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office that blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
They seem to have come out of that alley since the Democrats accepted that the “toxic” assets of some companies in difficulty are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added under which, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in protected companies that will cost him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
Under the plan, the federal government will have the option of delaying foreclosure procedures for real estate loans and setting limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the executives of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be released.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic parties.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of the skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hurried conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas made it known that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) due to the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the 10 largest insurers.
“It’s not about the money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are announcing uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the English Channel, the British government seems on the verge of nationalizing another bank in turmoil for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take care of all the loans currently underway at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty with the blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the enchanting smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last American film icons of the hectic years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
From mixed couples are often born magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he recognized an entire country invaded by the safe made man, the Pacific War fighter, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the New York Actor Studio, before triumphing in theater, television and early in cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked second at the Mans 24 Hours in 1979, as well as the sex symbol, although he has been part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadows of a reserved, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully unravel the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend’s disappearance of Paul Newman was a heartbreak for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation proposes itself again through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory the charming cowboy Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Burning Cat on the Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
Many other Paul Newman have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which he officially launched Newman in 1956.
That sympathetic villain in the excellent Stangata, Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's 1961 film The Color of Money, Martin Scorsese won him the only Oscar for nine nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was his.
It's him again.
The ages happen through its path.
He is best known for the cult film Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in My Father’s Era in 2003.
Unlike the more legendary filmmakers who soon left the profession, Newman will remain in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glory, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French film-maker, defined it, with a hint of irony, as "a living challenge to underplaying", judging its performance to be exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, heavy-drinking or desperate, of whom he expressed dissent and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a thin female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the innumerable tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade Robert Redford (who had starred together in The Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness, “His presence has made my life and this country better.”
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, it turns out a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift.
We’ve seen her face sticking out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her to be a bad-tasting choice, albeit born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, earmarked for his Foundation for Childhood in Trouble.
Newman, instead of relying on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying, "Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was equally a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & partners?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed under a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money obtained from tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, totaling 65 million florins, ended up partly in the treasuries of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method disclosed by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do this, the bill blocks were purchased at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured at Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on whose names to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag had sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of which the invoices were then prepared to be submitted to the competition notices, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has mainly drawn up the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of the "journey studies" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later called Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however 130 guests were included in the invoice.
But the compilers of the imaginary invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor’s office and the invoices were shown to him, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT of our company were at the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons did not return even the fact that according to the invoice 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the way, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The regular invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition to handwritten invoices.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor's Office, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - causing non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za’s HIB Kft. was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület ate there, which is why the company’s liquidation curator, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have deliberately issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Ssocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and partners Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices worth about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Real Estate Agency.
Neither did the movement of money because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to contact the General Manager of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 related to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 has purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian who between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the firms were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
The companies, however, became useful to him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: to the Atlasz and to the Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor's office believes that Kubatov has seized 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as the VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szovetség in Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért in January 2006 filed a notice for the public utility of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alapitv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the defendant number one, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about it extensively, he has not yet done so.
We have to see if it is in his interest, it could also happen that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the goat atonement.
Zuschlag could have been offended by the fact that his requests to ease his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrests, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damages can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which he is not allowed to do.
The psychology of bidding in excess: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have been able to uncover the neuro-economic basis for this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to stay behind in a race like the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
The research tried to trace the nervous pattern of this “match” at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brains of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win some money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex comes into play intensively when you lose the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striatum body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
They reported the actual value of the product in question to the control group and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this they promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
By checking the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher stakes in the control or "winning" group.
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to go to the doctor?
Almost half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver diseases are among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for contagious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stools become light and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die each year from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because pathogens fraudulently destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooists.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth talking to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while everyone watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University take part in addition to academics.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
Researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermeline painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this span of time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe,” as if “someone was taking care” of them and “they were reassured and pervaded by peace.”
Looking at the religious-themed image they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but it is necessary to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image towards which they nurture very positive feelings, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the search.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the day of Google’s 10th birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as much as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they’ve spent the holidays, what outpatient clinic they’re attending, and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, is not yet enough.
What concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the very substance of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “we put all the information in one system in the world!”.
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said: “If Google knew how to answer questions like ‘what am I going to do tomorrow?’ or ‘what would be the right job for me?’, the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.”
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches exactly the words they are looking for are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
By means of the Personalized Search launched two years ago, for example, users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - users are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the reactions of the Internet users are provoked by the fear felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion against power.
However, one fact is confirmed and that is that all the searched expressions are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify the pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights sought relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: neither can Google be forced by any point in the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully ripped off nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back to two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data scold Google because they believe that this will affect their privacy and privacy by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appearing in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up-to-date and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists their musical tastes, all of these can put them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear their latest photo galleries on Piclicka.fm
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, easily comes to know who spent the night with her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because he has written a sincere opinion on the corporate summit.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google’s search engine but at the same time voluntarily leaving no traces).
There are not a few people who don’t purposely sign up for community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not tied to huge server parks and that don’t make up our best profile yet.
Public opinion is not even waiting in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces also threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the software services introduced at the time of records do not cause big ones.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the corporate summit for example completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the line of the corporate nursery, considered too expensive the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of the employees, but all this diminishes the reputation of the Google in front of the fact that in 2006
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world to a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing health books and magazines of Google will take on such proportions that we will soon find ourselves in the face of this American system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two Minors Helped <0xC3><0x93>zd's Double Killer Disappear
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who are rightly suspected of helping to erase traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod Police Department said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, they are currently accused of favoritism.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves on their own.
Favor is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated manslaughter for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a huge debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have already submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner among all concerned and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster came about thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was not able to compact his party behind a fast-paced law, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it afterwards.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeline to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect, then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for EU member states to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Vienna-based Der Standard, according to which the fears that European taxpayers, like those of the United States, will also have to put a hand on their wallets to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not been much concerned about the crisis that has traversed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to swindle the 100 billion euros right away, however it would be better if they decided in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine mimics the flight of the cormorant
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if not to imitate the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hulls gave the initial strategic impetus to Nissan engineers on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a mini-robot equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's sight, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it weren’t for this, the robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place at a glance.
But unlike bees the deviation can not go upwards or downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the steering direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their lifespan is longer than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few dozen Kb.
You do not need a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, will be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further possibility of application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.

A written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements extended until midnight on Saturday according to the time of the East Coast, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that lasted for days - Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which the deal was left only to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, backed the plan’s compromise.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street but the reversal of the economic cart.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8:00 a.m. Washington time (2:00 p.m. on Monday, Central European time), but did not bring great stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the 2008 Economic Stabilization Act concerning the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House with joy.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which foresaw that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote of the Congress on Monday, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special college will monitor the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - announced the competent ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury Department guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay a price adequate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: The law provides the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law," he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid instead think that the government will limit their goodwill, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Restrictions on payments will only occur in some cases, furthermore, the restrictions depend on how the Treasury Department will offer help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the bank director.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation regarding the remuneration of general administrators - commented on the move the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to seize a share of the participating banks in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain if the economy, and together with the saved bank, get back on their feet.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that has how to return to taxpayers the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” Republican California lawmaker Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise.
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - informs the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
The prices of export sales of the industry in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, compared to the previous year they decreased by 3.9%
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher by 0.7% compared to the previous month and by 3.2% compared to a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales compared to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales of the processing sector also rose to a minimum, 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts by 4.6% and shoe production by 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the products and chemicals sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, taking into account the domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors, the largest increases were in the oil product processing sector (32.4%).
In the sector of the manufacture of products derived from the processing of metals, the increase in prices was 13.2%, of 11% in the field of the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
Prices decreased in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increases ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total, in the manufacturing industry, prices rose by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded by 18.7% last year.
In domestic sales among target groups of sectors, the biggest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods, prices increased by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sector, prices did not change compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest increase in prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins increased in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared in 12 months they decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian pound weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement can come into effect - the foreign minister talked about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the overseas electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will present the medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also backed the bank bailout plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion government plan to save banks on Sunday, but there are politicians calling for the Treasury minister's resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the plan to rescue the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial bailout package for the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves better suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the forefront of economic issues, Obama has again regained a bit of an advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin’s vice president, has dissipated.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that he also supported.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain’s economic ideas have been outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “All of us who are going to have a hard time bringing this situation down... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a committee of control of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good results of the top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware - Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have remodernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, so also of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, still in the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they were very wrong about the time. But the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase in possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The right pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, artisans, graduates and graduates.
Support for the CSU fell below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing domestic political situation in Austria created after the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now it’s all about the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television, party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists, is possible.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, leader of BZ<0xC3><0x96>, reiterated that he is open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for governing," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union, began.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, a Fidesz MEP from the European People's Party, in her message to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, more importantly, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla opened the conference at the highest level.
Invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz EP, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a ridiculous number of them can achieve a higher degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of EU member states.
In the view of the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider context between the Roma and the non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market increase; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of European citizenship of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," emphasized L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the member, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools, and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, the opportunities given to Roma children by the democratic space must be given so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the context of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be ensured for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised every year since last year's meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed to the top of the Bavarian CSU for the time being.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will be decided by the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not being attacked with all their strength in the chair.
They thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they fell to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of Germany's GDP.
Although conservatives in the southern region are always important to the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced to coalesce anyway.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heir of Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters representing right-wing values for a possible coalition government in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Voters enters the legislature Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also get an active role, which so far was plotting in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued a few stern statements to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory in 2005, is re-established by common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment over the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of land will not have a negative impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats on the other hand is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition did not enter the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the other hand, it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million people has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (UDF) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with a presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time in the parliament, would be represented in the 2006 general election following the constitutional amendment.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that can cross the country, he intended to improve the situation with the EU as a non-anti-Russian politician Lukashenko.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, had focused on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as a ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, considers the two countries to be independent.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition of the elections of 2006 it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let even one opponent into a weightless parliament".
The opposition does not intend to protest against the results, but rather tries to convey to the voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have a lot of problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the most officially helped class of the security, that of the pensioners, considers it appropriate to create the social regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increasing economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "reminiscent of sepulchral silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men do not believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were swivel doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure against the smarts, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
"A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of hinged doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary general said: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during business hours; no more coffee and cornetto.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the sick leave of public employees has decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people at work in a year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
"Whose wage dynamics over the past 8-10 years have been doubled compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today flags numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to disease - writes the Consumers Association - the people of 'operating fans' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands in Italy of correct and productive employees of the public administration who have united to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will be challenged against the exclusion of additional economic treatment for service-related illnesses; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which control visits are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "strong appreciation for the continued associative commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, the care of the families of the victims and public awareness".
“Of course, an indignant ‘enough’, sincerely shared, has arisen in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people who face the world of work.
It is necessary to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to slow down in the alarm about its social severity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to urgently end it".
"The data on occupational injuries seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not detract from the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we would not want this “downward trend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention loosens that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that on a general level too little is done to counter the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, more controls and inspections are needed, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this starting from the world of school".
"An additional effort is needed - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection for the victims of work" and the "assistance drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or donation from time to time arranged by the legislator".
MP3 Players Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is according to the European Commission, which in a statement published in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csserri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-noise mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters most, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the high use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits for maximum noise permitted in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - he emphasizes Alemano - It will have to submit proposals for an idea of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the desire to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time period.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital ".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemano replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the daily and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking in a spirit of unity about its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to be independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on her website: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!”
In reality, these are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Again, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know who will give his vote the American patriot.
One side of the U.S. mentality comes out covered up to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89% said: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicking in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the most part was Bush’s weak point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
In the United States, the economic upheaval is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national-level journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses open a doorway to the Internet, for many views as the "murderer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists are experiencing has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it “does something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run newsrooms — that is, the directors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who think they will lose their job within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters, it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and so it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all days after the third to reach a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often get “sick” during the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS TO GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation counter-agreement investigation.
In the course of the trial in his charge, last week, he obtained the release from home transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel the route from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
However, according to the court, these moves (which the pm has given a negative opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirms this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the Central States.
The soul, by the way, which became predominately alive with the vow that I said at the beginning.
But this just mentioned is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake perhaps predicts or already shows: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that have long since solidified and finally come to light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that have, yes, close ties with abroad, but that first of all see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, very much involved.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the question or has little to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union, which, as usual, divides between different interests and between different state strategies and is unable to decide on any common policy.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when you get to the bottlenecks it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back to a standstill.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the national-state element is, after all, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely related factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had already entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with those very little immaterial things.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who are sovereign have certainly more cards than those who are not, who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufferability, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, there seems to be a growing belief in large sections of the population that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in vogue, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly fuels a branched but powerful Bush movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political systems, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" of the elections or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and most recent times, from the rise of the British to the rise of the conservatives in Austria-Bavaria.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is aggravating.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scientists managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glazed paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “easily detaches from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars presented a microfiber-like hair sticker that self-cleans from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time with some life-saving drugs, they alter their absorption by increasing or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia has launched a new alarm: it is enough to reduce the effects of some medicines with grapefruit juice, grapefruit and orange juice.
Grapefruit juice was already on trial because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
The Italian Agency for Medicinal Products for Human Use (AHRM) reported this in a bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to be careful about what to drink in the event of taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan, said: “These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration's foreign policy and economic choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that triggered not a few polemics and that for years was faced with the economist, but that has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great economist” but also a publicist with a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of libertarianism”.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most popular Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, who are supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the interface magazine and rendered less spartan, other more substantial ones are added, such as the native compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the format DFul.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some features specific to some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphic processing form, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which aggregate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene at several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The English version is available for download at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a drag for the spread in the houses, it is precisely in the business area that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the PowerPoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also proves positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the Wax, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity of Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber polo shirt.
IMMIGRATION:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED, IS ITALY RAZZISTA?
Italy "has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what is being asked in a long article by the New York Times that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of car-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The housing market for college students is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious character to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the office of studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand on the part of students has so distorted the market to trigger a general process of increase".
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, no fee limit, sub-rents connected.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a sleeping place in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (zone Vittoria).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You only save if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari it takes 250/350 euros for a single bed, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rentals to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee asked to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities delete the historic rooms
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multisales and the consequent death by consumption of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and so many emotions," notes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Academy Award and the Grand Prix of the province of Cannes a way, and that tells the story of a cinematography for the jury of Cannes, and that
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, speak clearly: over the past five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and the biggest ones are the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favor of businessmen: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, they would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote the cinemas in one room both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
The rules include tax relief measures in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for stopovers and in some car parks.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” notes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by dust I turn around the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli basin".
There are heavy accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and vice-mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the same name of the boss, already convicted for association to delinquent of mafia form, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In disregard of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the cosca - write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and address of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusion between local authorities and organized malavita there are many" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cossack.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cossack had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, it emerged "the willingness to match the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosmos".
When the energy is born from the waves now the big ones come down into the field
It is an exterminated field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, giants like the Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalist instances and the new increase in oil give impetus to the industry.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore waveforms.
That would be twice as much as nuclear power plants currently produce.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossians on attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a U.S. oil giant affiliate to the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a signal not recently, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power are on the path of energy coming from the sea and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, facilities such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
