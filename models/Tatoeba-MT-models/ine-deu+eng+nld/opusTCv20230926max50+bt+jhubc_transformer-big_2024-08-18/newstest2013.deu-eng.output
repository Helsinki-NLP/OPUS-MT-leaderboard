A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, affirming that electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans’ lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding elections in each state.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of U.S. governments have announced new laws that complicate the procedure for registration or the passage of ballots.
This phenomenon has gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court document exists.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state had asked voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states forcing voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an identity card in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered voters who vote more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who are more likely to vote for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general elections have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new voters in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites representing 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the display of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics criticize the partisan nature of the passed laws and see it as a clear goal to influence the results in the states that will determine 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of the already undecided men to perform early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two experts.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were numerous inter-control factors, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a follow-up observation after 12 years, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not impair the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment when the disease progresses.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not are determined.
That is why I recommend the test to be carried out.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine if it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer,” he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity it increases the risk of getting a gritty or mast cell cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his familial preoccupation.
"Doing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but empirically not yet observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still lacking to be completely sure.
Still, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of cheating, and let’s take a look at what it’s about.
There is an indispensable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to break this rule – and don’t try it too hard as you’ll get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also have such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, when they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" consisting of some of their properties in general.
On the basis of this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons move, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure by the Berkeley Laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electrical charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" exactly at this point, into something like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stabilized field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disrupted" in order for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to reach very high energies, a bit comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be shredded by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) do not have a mass.
For what can all this research be “good” now, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to study all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major flaws, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of these studies on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that the laser was initially considered a “laboratory toy”.
Imagine yourself...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras around the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate needs to resume soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that ate him had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made seven years," he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed at the palliative care home of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with the meal.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, as this is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinking while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, large events take place amid these setbacks.
The patients who are referred to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer crowded with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by drowning.”
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no more desires in life,” she says, before accepting that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the coming days, she still expects a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offers body care and food intake assistance.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, a bed for palliative care is provided for 11,700 people.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help family members and patients alike,” says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, there is no day like the other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family reunion in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while being insulted in his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two young children, tragically dies after trying everything he can to...
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, more or less specialize exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Precisely this large inadequacy in Quebec’s health care ensures that several physicians specializing in palliative care face the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before being accepted to go to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any action to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don’t receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst prognosis until the last day.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a troubled chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have been asked to die thank the caregivers for not fulfilling this wish after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal-based Society of Home Palliative Care, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient falling asleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, companies of the main construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has broken down since drastic measures have been taken," joked Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the misconduct related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts,” he emphasizes, because some tamed their instincts to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Troupe", which has been causing the Montreal "Channel Cartel" to be more restrained in the artificial inflating of the contracts since 2009...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and filed charges of fraud and corruption against municipal legislators such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of receiving lubricant money repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal road construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly charged.
The latter has attracted attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalisation contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially collected.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they were getting smeared by artificially inflating bills with false surcharges by 30-40%.
In addition, one of the organizers of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a communal property that was purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately being carried out, she says that she is “pulling a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system migrated by ants in order to stop the evil and insult the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigative unit, as well as supervision, to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "mandate holders who are over the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is just a weak slap in the face of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot go deeper; by going to the bottom with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
In a game, it is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of the INF Clairefontaine preparatory training to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to face up and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we are in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the return of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to seeing this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, as we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something to blame, that’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proved our strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and that has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead for the game break!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were boosted by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winners in May and tell us that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he’s played, he’s made it clear that he’s a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking some time off to play.
I have seen things there from which I have come forth.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the tie forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a starter game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent that allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s exchange rate reached a high of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competitive with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts ledger distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can effortlessly check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible up to a hundred millionths, which leaves a certain scope...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-final sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by retailers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of overhauling hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It’s going to take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are highly regarded today in the event of the success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and injured.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who deny an armed foreign presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with French loans, was properly carried out.
The truck and tank convoys overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influx into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war because of the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover was considered a kind of liberation and a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by seizing government property to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have defrauded themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose command it will stand be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization in the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, working dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Priority will be given to private initiative.
In a country that has been at the root of 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
It was rumored that Afghanistan possessed vast land treasures.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export through the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' and boys' high schools, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to help and try to prevent the "hearts and minds"
These works, which required a large number of local workers, have helped to suppress the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very harsh in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their desire, it would be necessary to carry on less, more well-controlled and directly concerned civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution with the Breaking Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever regarding the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional, amended text for almost two years now, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “trample the law with his feet.”
On the side of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to an overhauled vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not respond to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they had not been able to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To reach the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, including deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was not going exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow, are responding with “pretty sanctity.”
According to them, the islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They have particular regard to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the persons who are asked for a statement have not been elected and do not possess any democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system," reassured Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He concedes, however, that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made here to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights groups have demanded.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text, which they regard as a threat to freedom.
The reality of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, the article no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Bend before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, silencing the storm of the sea and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the temples are located in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the path of suffering or the cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the place of crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Walls of Lamentation, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the top
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies, which Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, there is a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is once the Israel Museum near the Knesset (parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean desert, as well as approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits, are kept.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
It houses the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the memorial for the children, which was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died are uttered.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air heats up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore carries even non-swimmers without problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sols) and healing sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These are the secrets of the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow alleys named after signs of constellation.
Fortune is supposed to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
List of attractions for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can usually get there by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a expressway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations that connects the sub-city with the upper city.
Precisely speaking, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales, and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unhindered.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of cars parked.
The cats like lively places and do not say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which is an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa waiver on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While lawmakers and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families who remained in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every migrant to pass a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
In doing so, one must not only take language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language proficiency must be demonstrated for both obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, Problems and Protection of Rights
The totality of the examination posts will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement of having to demonstrate language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, according to the spokespersons of the Migration Authority, the aim is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of working migrants," said Viktor Sebelev, the head of the representative of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure dozens of his own months without food and documents and will spend 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you are promised one, and upon arrival you will be cheated, get their passports taken away and will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only unable to speak the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, as rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, then there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "No entry for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and then cases of blackmail arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Don’t worry about the cost of the wrong papers.”
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That’s more than double the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, is agreed by both officials and civil rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who pass the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
Proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
In this way, the authorities react to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths during the amok run of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairperson of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - urged the authorities to refrain from "meaningless aggravations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice , Wassily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, the guards are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that were stolen both from the police weapons chambers and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military stockpiles.
In many military camps there were frequent explosions.
“There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover up the lack of weapons,” the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private armaments factories that are not able to withstand international competition and therefore throw weapons at hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production of its own, sometimes handicrafts, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military official explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
According to investigators, the bulk of illegal weapons come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there because of the “indebtedness of those responsible who have been dealing with weapons in their work,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from theft in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop who doesn’t want to be named assures that weapons found in illegal excavations haven’t been bought for a long time because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to obtain the replenishment in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT type pistol, is purchased via a flag carrier.
The weapon is displayed and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
“Of course, the police are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically carry out check purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons,” the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find out about acquaintances to each other.
I had watched websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there.

"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who says that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m currently even coming up with a few hits about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the percussion rings just because he knows I don't swear at him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the soldier recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller to the forest, and there we set up a target disk.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No paperwork is required, and there are no personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buy a combat pistol or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched to countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go online to the service.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shove coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the concealment of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislow, a spokesman for Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can go out empty and come behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched to countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go online to the service.
“People come like hungry fish for feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shove coal,” he says.
A Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts say prices range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by mid-range guards.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers are on strike
One in four U.S. teenagers sits behind the box office of Mc Donald’s
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict if the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food employees, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when sales in the United States took place that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to handshakes.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and, together with unions and left-wing activists, reached out to branches of the chain whose target group are low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company’s own health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if the company raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they’re currently donating for wages.
If Walmart were to shift the wage increases completely to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be a yearly increase in expenditure of only $12.39 compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there were protests in only nine states and they did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees laid off the work and the protest action was just “another PR trick” of the union organizing the protests.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart branches (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore do not exist until now), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average, their simple New York employees get $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city deserves less than she.
How it is possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teens were behind the counter at McDonald’s after school, but the teens were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I'm constantly meeting people who complain that they have to cope with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law forbids business executives from standing in the way of this goal and admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, the management of the company does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a noon meeting in front of McDonald's in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not being paid sick days, and you're not doing your job!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, far from all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overstated so far"
The theme of augmented reality, popular with fans of modern technologies, has lately been perceived for the most part by the lens of a special spectacle.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company were just a transit station.
It excites the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to foresee 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we have in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still playing out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output is not yet decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more comprehensible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these fucked up virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of object control in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short gestures instead of outgoing gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language.
- What do you mean?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this can?
They say it and mean it at the same time.
- Normally, I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can’t do at any given time?
Not necessarily, but it's about getting closer to each other.
I think that in the next few years we will have to work on developing new types of sensors, which will allow us to capture more accurately the reactions of people.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are especially too little for gestures.
At our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might be able to solve the problem...
Or exacerbate the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to determine how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
“If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (private only you can see), but at the same time also their weakness, because an augmented reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all.
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often talk about the fact that augmented reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection substrate.
It takes pressure very well!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" something handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently but still so weak as if someone was breathing over the palms.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overwhelm the brain?
Thinking that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be outnumbered moderately, and we still have many hard-working years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list were already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city limits and often find recognition in Europe without being known to the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who you sometimes meet at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant figure of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, charms his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and provides them with a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a recorder and became a Petersburg recorder, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates somewhat from the norm of graying evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Newsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only over.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical and artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovation works.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
String and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and also included the composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, became out of their "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Persons of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I reached the pinnacle.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it’s easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be like that.
In a clown, this blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of the man.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
We just saw you play the city's organ player, a city of culture should have a hero like that.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We are witnessing the decline of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Michailow come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings that even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov with a collector.
I started with pictures that usually don’t come until the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, this is something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They are called servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real Tsars it was different, because the Tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked because they need higher-ranking experts who evaluate the former correctly and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nurturing ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us it is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in Danger.
Earth warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth inhabitants on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is how can we reproduce in gravitylessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“It’s Mars and Venus,” says Vladimir Surdin, a scientist at the Sternberg Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at great heights or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was initially addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas grown in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the earthly species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how gravitylessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to stop; it has to be able to stand on its feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems at RAN.
Without a solid ground, the chicks swarm wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely waned.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
“Two times we let chicks sneak in and then shut it down because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychev says of the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do this in principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagulls flew away from it, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Can it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered that question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child’s father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, who after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolab in the Cosmonauts Preparatory Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Although adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness to the fact that life on land originated in the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb of the mother for about 9 months in amniotic fluid, and the fact that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
“That’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimmer Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn child, therefore, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze the child out.
All right, let's get around this by birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the grounding, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unfit person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical Biological Problems of the RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become a reality when the inhabitants of Earth in their spaceships break up into a distant planet, which will be the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A>-Chef: Control of the Black System Failed by Blaming Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but does not apply them.
In a conversation for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly – and in my opinion this is not the case with us,” Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government can not simply come, and the control office, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared with each other.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of European legislation setting out how public procurement is to be handled, based on national legislation, and finally on the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have been able to see extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in our country are perhaps even a little "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules over and over again, but also to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does this project mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and lower and eliminate thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paper load", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the threshold values remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similarly structured to ours and also has a college that is formed only slightly differently.
The competences are also to some extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these accounting offices also in the individual states - in which the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by our districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounting courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better at everything.
Is it because the inspectors are better?
I certainly don’t, but as I said, I don’t like comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
As far as the Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
Given the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our exams.
Since our checks take place afterward, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to feel the effects in the preparatory phase of future checks - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detecting risks of ineconomy" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an effect, as the thresholds have changed, the conditions have been changed for certain types of checks.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the extent that any non-compliance with the law on the award of contracts amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out of here?
First of all, let’s say which path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come and hinder the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, in its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we are missing.
On the roads there are occasional ice sheets, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
Mostly, however, the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were well manoeuvrable this morning, with occasional snow and ice plains.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, during the day they should be slightly warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and only a thin snow cover remains in the lower altitudes.
On the combs of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, sectionally required or outgrown snow remains remain.
Particularly in the higher layers, therefore, increased attention is required.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of ice melting, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an elaborate layer of snow on the roads, the road and highway directorate announces on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers of ice slickness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Glaciers can be found, in particular, on second and third-class roadways in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extensive snow cover is located in high altitudes on the streets of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
Today it is mostly sunny or warm in East Bohemia, and it remains largely without precipitation.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen (district)
Today, the roads in the district of Pilsen are well accessible, but local attention has to be paid and the driving style has to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures have subsequently fallen, it can cause ice melting on the roads.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the vision will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district street championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended for road championships between the 80th and the 131st kilometers.
The first-class roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there can be ice smoothing in sections.
The roads of the second and third class of road are wet, and therefore the reference to possible required sections also applies here.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc (district)
Today, drivers who are travelling in the direction of the high altitudes in the district of Olomouc have to count on snow skiing.
After the use of sprinkler vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass and on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nightly snow driving forced the road championships to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk fell according to the road administration about 3 cm of new snow.
In the rest of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, the highest altitudes are still snowy.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k have to expect snow," an employee of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Her colleagues in the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also had to go out at night, according to her, the streets up to the heights are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc County, the roads are fully accessible, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk County, drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several poorly passable sections of the road at the same time.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the county of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is blocked according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero at lower levels, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads, but no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially south-east of the Central Bohemian Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Glacier is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless skies and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the I/13 road on the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec districts.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think will happen in less than a month from the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more amused about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world from falling.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21st at 11:10 am.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is said to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
Initially probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the collapse of the world, but we also want to reflect together with the public on the state in which we once pass on this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called hymn against the decline of the world with the title "The decline of the world falls out".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube today. Will it also be performed at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and finally, assuming that everything works and the world does not fall...
The anthem is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a live broadcast by Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charitable events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working together with the Tap Association at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will create our own building, which we will then move into with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria did you choose these?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the US - would also like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be carried in the luggage compartment. And of course we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnessing that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
In front of Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for people with disabilities. There, it is still unusual when someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city center.
It is not even natural to leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we hang out with...
However, it should be noted that the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and freedom of access is a thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a caregiver at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in getting involved with something intense.
And since I myself am a musician and play saxophone, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, tends to say, something got out of hand (laughs).
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also begun to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and it is not visible from the outside, one’s own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and more.
Was it your goal to get it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is looked at with caution and only after a long time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is part of it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and also demand some discipline.
This, however, is, in my opinion, perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have to rehearse twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But this is how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, that is, since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted world's end, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other via live broadcast and a common interpretation of the anthem "World Falling Out" of the band The Tap Tap is sounded.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional educational centre for people with disabilities, to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency, making it the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Of course, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, so they did not always encounter understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP deer, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth's side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the Draisine.
The information in this regard comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled rifles.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down, it is evident that the research was advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket originated by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialist press, and the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda vojettrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish an aerospace company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a regular member as early as the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the deputy chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor of the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a capacity of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a capacity of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth noting that Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Repealing the Nonprofit Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the Non-Profit Works Act.
This decision sparked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wage), there are price tensions.
By this term is meant a state in which the manufacturer tries to exist by importing favourable goods into economic competition by "undercutting" competition in order to rip off a larger market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies moving their production abroad or purchasing cheaply there, or giving up their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: Governments hand over their own populations to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to economic compulsion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other, to the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For several years now, there have been public food dispensers in Germany for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary personnel employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states will undoubtedly result in the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger wage on the fringes of society, hoping to invest in land.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from.
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, the workers work at all for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the extreme that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that a planned economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense, or even directs it.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, due to a lack of finances, commissions private law firms closely intertwined with industry with the preparation of bills.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then proceeds no longer from the people, as Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are currently quickly getting into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey's: "The state had long been in disarray, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against smear money, through illegal leaching of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew uninhibited, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about that the only man in this serious situation was the one who was strong enough to be a sole proprietor of the people" ...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the benefit for the whole of society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's standpoint, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are completely unaware of the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, of the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, as well as of the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and newer history.
The repeal of the Non-Profit Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be any,” says the dying Gute Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
One stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, supports the Palestinians, argues with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and calls the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit in these recurrent waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It’s about giving readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East above all serve.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or what group of people is influencing the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don’t know if anyone else is above them, but I’m not excluding this) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, against the background of which there was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or arming themselves on them (before the assault on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the assault on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi's bank remained only his central government in four, with Russia remaining among the four).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay for it with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars in 1859-1871 by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain was to be broken, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would not provide for their amenities and their luxury, and would not provide for so many resources).
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order from chaos – order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I through the assassination of the Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsardom through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsardom), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power Austria-Hungary.
In order to ignite the Second World War more easily, the German bankers had to create a latent conflict situation through politics, by filling Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the prerequisite of impoverished masses, so that they only had to underestimate the Germans with a strong enough leader, who was also a culprit of the solution.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler got rid of the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like in World War II, will fall victim in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with in the beginning the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as in us, the people, put exclusively their own candidates to the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist 20% economy, loyal to the international bankers of the world, who would do anything to ignite a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), could quickly get out of control of the world.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In her conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it causes the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, all to give to themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell, because they have the mark, which is the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: let him that hath understanding consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist protesters occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the Revolution, who had held the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at hostage-taking only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to disguise their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film vary - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly spiked as a result.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the floor of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable start to his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Crime No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the director's hometown Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that made the previous films of this director stand out from the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entrance sequence of the message's storm is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story goes somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team even in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes re-imagining reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood co-workers, but their characters would have deserved more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of traction as a result, it is a film that you can follow with some interest, while enjoying the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day, and as a proof of the extent to which the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are overlaid, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually launches a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
"This idea led us to the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, told the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
“Further incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory mixing of bioethanol with fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has been substantially amended this year.
Criticism has also been raised in the past by the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks with a veto threat, for example).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonizes the non-uniform national standards that would impede trade.
The EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this poll may be the EU regulation from last year, which according to balloons when sold must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of choking of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market launches.
There are also curious ideas at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally came to the Czech Republic to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for grant applications was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), in particular it should be funds for the establishment of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, but some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotions are also raised in this country by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name Olomoucké <0xC5><0xA1>ava<0xC5><0xBE><0xC5><0xAF>ky after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the inland rum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for products derived from sugar cane distillate, not for products derived from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or parma ham now also includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or also the Saazer hops.
With an EU mark, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can be baked.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would not be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves roaming around freely, while people are being raised taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, then I’m trying to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then went straight to the castle.
Are you not turning your back on your constituents?
I told myself the whole time that I would start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, scold, but that we put down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to rob you of honor and confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle was started with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make bills.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have committed myself to keeping the guide a free trade and this could be enforced.
The problem is petty-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party leader, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without the mindset of a drawer and party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more to the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we continue.
I don’t care if someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You hate it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And this you want to approach.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you have only keywords left.
In the long run, you will not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to implement these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the defendants might have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to mishaps can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things for myself; and if it doesn’t work out, then in six years I’ll be back in the private sector.
That sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I’m not achieving anything on my own; that’s why I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether or not they want to run for the Senate as well.
I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, for example, but he refused due to work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district mayors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, what does yours look like?
My private assets are estimated at approximately CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant with women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to make debts?
I have already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors shows that my program probably does not arouse too much interest.
And I am not obligated to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; so, for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to drive those activities back?
But this is not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I have partly driven back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
As president, however, I would cease all my activities.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built bookshelf - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby big company, says, "Well, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city in need of a visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to replicate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become master of statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of bold beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual calmness and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still staring around and groaning with his armpits, the rude Maas piled his exquisitely sized companion into a pyramid and ended his actionistly backed-up speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So this is it, my proposal for the bookshelf of Spijkenisse, for the so-called bookshelf!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro expensive mountain is poured out.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project has also been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incomprehensible ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese bells.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the real pleasures of space and reading open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelf stands along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes armor, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even incorporated architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycling materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm one day.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a base in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ready for the blocking waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps, you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, you will be rewarded in the Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide for atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the mountains of literature.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glass fall, the sun even on sunny days only briefly shines inwards.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand transversely to the glass facade, serve as shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already dared to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the first time, the optical gaps in the library – currently 70,000 – are to be filled.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in achieving that royal discipline, which is called the Foundation of Identity in the specialist jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin balances this on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin was gone.
What's that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to its special relationship with Israel, Germany must now be cautious.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just reversing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was so to say managed by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still approaching their role, but they are on their way to a “normaler” foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take up positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to throw the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect with this.
Because it signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly spoken out for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has quite a bit of understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not at all as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still struggling to take the lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is continuously decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's uncomfortable for you and it still makes you a lot unpopular - c'est la vie!

China's 'brand protection': When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they get it right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm, which specializes in trademark infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their trademarks.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property is well known.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he argues against the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right by the Trademark Office to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
That is, women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not to blame.
“This is damaging to business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand is being diluted, the loneliness is disappearing, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long term the contested name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not to blame.
Although the Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the workflow returned to normality".
Thus, the inventory of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 objections are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified means that each application costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
In contrast, it costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was missed because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO rejected the objection of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight today.
You have to be careful hellishly
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the dishes.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely time-consuming and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company's archive even had to go through 100-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much it's worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to return to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected marks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long since been abandoned by the Group, but it was nevertheless able to refuse registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “apply everything that is somehow worth protecting in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other side license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aids Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that far exceeds 8733 kilometers.
First there is stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the pace on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then only the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - to oppress, deceive and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to Unaids, the United Nations’ programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Association Voices for Africa has found paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and bringing them back from time to time to where they originally came from: in the South of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are subject to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the whole of Swaziland is ill: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying by the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a high school diploma, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has since almost professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filth lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers, and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless, about 20 percent of new HIV infections fall to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
For in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Who has no one else, comes to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and organized with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not self-evident, because so obviously the disease is also in the whole country, one prefers to silence it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There would be free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but those are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years together through southern Africa and sings songs full of bitterness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has already riddled some angry border soldiers of a few tears.
The trip always takes you to Esitenjen, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitheni, there is the light," the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 km air line to Heidelberg, to the squeaking singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice blanket may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids hitting Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said lead scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to the Earth: small gaze holes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image from an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are identified as blue dots, while the pink "newborns" in the constellation are harder to identify.
This star-forming region – unromanticly called W5 by scientists – has been discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come to prominence better.
Like a red age, the Helix fog in this infrared photo looks towards the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned it the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
In its full beauty, this baby star could only be captured by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of Hubble’s largest and sharpest images: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (threefold, threefold), as dark dust stripes trifect the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of Serpents, astronomers have photographed the forebodings of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusing galaxies race toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Wedge is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected to the rosette nebula, continuously generates new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found mostly in the universe.
Our Insights into the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it to observe stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become bigger and bigger – and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
Despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors in total, the binoculars can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should comprise a set of 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures should be taken at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The latest launch preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The messenger probe, launched in 2004, is the first to orbit Mercury, and scientists are now confident.
Drinking butter every day - and getting 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trail search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus roams over the winding road, past dense wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian folk group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is full of architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too troublesome is the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talys from the area documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he turned 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Muslümov’s age still seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Muslümov settle for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Overwhelmingly many elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence about the age, especially since the register of personal status was missing.
Every day cups of melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live in the south?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in the diet.
But the fact that the calorie-rich diet of the Talyches should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, also does not seem to be plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two kids are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly lined, under her headcloth she hides long, dark-blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I haven’t bought food in a supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman’s mouth.
But the cult that is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need among the elderly of Azerbaijan.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grey son is also right: “The elderly enjoy high regard in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely disputed.
The Egyptian president did not spare Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all of them, so far hopelessly dissected in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-State on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is what the Egyptians are all about, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judiciary be abolished?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean by “principles”?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance in all Sunni Islam, must be taken care of.
That doesn’t have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees legislation, which would de facto have the effect of discouraging the judiciary.
Much in the draft draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The state should also, the draft states, "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values".
This is so vaguely formulated in law that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly defines the equality of men and women.
To do this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally doubtful is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a cartoon of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
A matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Morsi is present for signature and will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for a referendum, according to his words.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the charter down before it could even take effect.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belonged "on the garbage hill of history".
Via Twitter, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but for the sake of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi, “Clean the land!” and affirmed, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have evoked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Morsi’s followers did not want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to run until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim brothers while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday."
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto putting it out of action," Saeda lamented.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which views the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could avenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You are feeding a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most stinky fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty stinky fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And load them there for a week.
One has to imagine the nose-popping smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There’s snow here, spectacular landscapes – and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn’t want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-soaked trout, which – depending on how stinky you would like your fish – is fermented in water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also organizes the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk General".
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the rakfish," says Havard.
Spirits can suppress the smell.
I'll cost you a few bucks.
If you avoid getting the rakfish close to your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater tanks in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians looking for work were forced to leave their country and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not too long ago was far richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – as an essential, albeit strictly fragrant, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother with that.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been responsible for Norway’s wealth.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays of ripe rakfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very bragging, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money that they did not even possess, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfish," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elf burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat sniffs me.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is back on the menu.
The hotel I stay at is one of several venues that organize a Rakfish dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-dressed showmaster surrounded by plates of rakfish.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You smile and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the rigor of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico’s future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogging city, but on Monday, a steel ring was erected, blocking several important traffic routes to the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, expansive part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who serves as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, which works for PRI.
In particular, when it comes to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the past two years at a site in Brachland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nietos believe that he did not adequately address the problem of female murder during his term.
But in the worst case scenario, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downgraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stiffness had already been applied.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the wall and is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this, the family says, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a chatterer, a troublemaker, a nurse.
They want their judgment to be simply accepted and their mouths shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Bond on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes in the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term.
"I hope that as president he is what he was as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Prosecution Claims: Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Abuse
The prosecutor's office denies Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment due to harsh conditions of detention
The liberated U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The U.S. Attorney’s Office on Friday tried to establish that Army liberated Bradley Manning — accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning’s nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
The day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the indictment — Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison term — Manning had stated that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out with Manning after their meetings with him during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been incarcerated under enhanced conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although Manning’s officials had questioned him directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they were not recorded.
“They wrote (after discussing the concerns) ‘No problems,’ and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting had been to lower his observation status to “prevention of injuries.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the threat of suicide - to his own and the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational injury prevention status... in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning announced his arrest and relocation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and was once unconscious due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was a burden.
“My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell—at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours—and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lay down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up so that he could turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned about an allegation he had made in his statement on Thursday – such as sleeping naked in his cell in Quantico one night and having to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this count.
During Friday's questioning, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before and had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the collar of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and drastically reduce his detention, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is set for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offences, while other charges that are deemed to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations that apply to all of Quantico’s highest security guards.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, illegally publishing classified information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame emigrants – they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when insanity widened in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Foreigners" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, not sure which one to go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent won’t let me go either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc following the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to hand over more than half of its territory to them under restraint.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as a U.S. government official makes even the slightest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty goes to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living — not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are — and Mexican Americans take it badly.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational civics want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Oh, well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge against the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual culprits, countless buildings have been laid in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed – and for the first time rockets from Gaza have been struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly pat situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate given the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its own group had to suffer heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being suffocated in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a revitalizing regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheerful Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could face an increasingly Islamist imprint on Bashar Assad’s overthrow, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – by far the most populous and important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region in a lasting way.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the fraternity with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have drawn an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israel will be able to sleep quietly for a while.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States is unwavering in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers – not least thanks to the blockades that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also slander and leave them a state of their own?
If they really had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could make them a move through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense state is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
As the rest of the Arab world takes razor-sharp steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back into the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one that is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by land swaps and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also has to help move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he failed to conceive of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally reluctant to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Laws on Uniform Cigarette Packaging Coming Into Force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging came into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and babies and children with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, will be from next Saturday.
Australia introduces the world’s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at 26 are 99 percent more likely to stop smoking at 26 years of age.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has risen enormously since the corporations British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Law Courts of the Australasian Tobacco Courts two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop exposing cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to advertise its products, doesn’t come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in reports of experience with brands written by “very normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even makes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are doing more trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a tip and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box that has a picture of a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the unified packaging has made it more difficult to fill up his shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to sort out a shipment, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he adds visibly disgusted.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make myself a few thoughts of boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us these days are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see this as such.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of “wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it”.
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Ungaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a paper on the previous volume, which was attended by a participant of the
Some groups listened to a loud TV show from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television reported feeling more boredom than the two other groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for this, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you perform a monotonous activity - "as well as searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that squats and squats, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to crouch around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a buzzing loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
Some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a “boring vulnerability scale” in the 1980s.
On the scale, there are statements like "Many things I have to do are repeating themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly as regards the need for more and more variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
However, he is sure that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall for gambling or drugs to relieve them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else,” said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can create feelings of happiness in the short term, but in the long term these feelings become fleeting again.
So, if you give your bored child an iPad, it can relieve him of boredom, but he has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain himself, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we look at them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology training.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the agonizing, unceasing desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to disconnect and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to deal with once the noise is muted.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuana Act
19-year-old community college student and footballer Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana blocks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug utilities — cavalry offenses each punishable by a $100 fine — and received a court date.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for home use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of infractions surrounding marijuana have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent. This will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced they are continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from suburban Denver to the Western Mountains, are agreeing to block new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited to orientation,” says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Regulatory Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6 and thus also forms the end point of a gray area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time – such as how the state’s requirement of “reasonable access” to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the banning of cannabis businesses within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in individuals over 21 years of age, and that the police would "immediately" seek no criminal charges for those offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana, and drug dealers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to abduct.
Currently, 119 people have to be held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
“Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offences at the time of the act,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even ambiguous in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, are no longer showing adults for possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a deep-seated split among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to be carried out.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendant in court for marijuana offenses and acts on-site as a spokesman for the national marijuana law reform organization.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for not being able to accept legalization,” he said.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being acted as national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal selling, they are nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite several startling arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration drug policy adviser, is of the opinion that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they will probably be stymied by tolerating legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said City Council member Bob Nicholson.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We focus on what the community has chosen, not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
It’s not just college students today who are being attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the world’s largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving to Worscester College in the late 1980s — where I had planned to study history — I had packed my bags again, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it said I would have left because I had a problem with having classmates having sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson said insultingly that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason – one reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate-rights students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) state that they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They are calling for a place on their college’s Equal Opportunity Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University’s Conservative Student Association, driving in a Rolls-Royce and bragging in a silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sin-bombs for introducing higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University’s Conservative Student Association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing leftist trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the quest for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says she has a growing dislike of JCR members.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the mining workers’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wooden-paneled rooms of the tutorium.
At my first of these events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been caught on what was to come.
“Miss Wyatt,” said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
“Are thatcher followers refusing to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students sneered.
There are tears in my eyes.
“I suggest they take a few French lessons in their spare time — so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt grumbled to me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics, and economics who had ironically attended Eton College, a conservative college, told me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and repress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me extended before my spiritual eye to a sweeping fire of esteem and isolation.
The only tutor who was openly identified as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-Determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said softly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends were always showing impeccable manners.
His moist eyes tingled.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nailed.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory follower, had given up on the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history teacher had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I secretly shrank from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to “brainwashing” and called them “old fools.”
The relief only lasted a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
As they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Feel free to call me a wintry flapping tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malevolence in an educational institution.
And even more tragically, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture were compiled, created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t kick their chickens out on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, we went home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt its influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" who began her career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessiveness, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long walkway that suggests a change of scenery: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamlike "audience" that is wearing the masterpieces of Valentino's knighthood, such as the knighthood of her knighthood, the knighthood of her knighthood, the knighthood of her knighthood.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzes" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half meters long bow.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always noticed his sophistication, his calmness, his well-groomed and perfect appearance,” admits D’Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano’s bearers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur across the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur rocks that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle's pace, keeping their balance and setting their steps carefully so that they do not slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 exploits the deposits in the volcano and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for every kilo of sulfur.
This then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matchwoods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with fieldwork.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are converted to Islam, and I have converted them to Hinduism, and I have converted them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at stake at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty log cabin with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for man," protests Madrusin, a regular, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money for the upbringing of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and squeezes the miners into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees, pain in the knees, and blisters.
With the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty persists from generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as a human cargo ship at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Needs Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans are blaming having no children on their careers, the stress and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but still - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song that local sayings such as "slide a "bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of Singapore's low birth rate.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (quick flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take this issue lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But so far, everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia that is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its National Population Authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people, in addition to marrying and forming a family, to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of singles and delays in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration in order to counteract the decline of the population led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely concealed xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer directions, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, it is clear from the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district that they will not have a major impact.
“People are under a lot of stress, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
The children can have others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy (disambiguation)
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to if he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequently online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “on the password and the user” when applying it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t disclose my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world,” he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
“I wouldn’t share a picture that’s not of me, or of someone who makes a fool of me,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of nudity, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives in the distance or with friends quickly," he says.
When asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone oppresses me or demands them from me, I just remove them from my user account,” he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of the experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he wasn't sympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe one out of him.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are the children and adolescents who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published, or said, and this at an age where the maturity for it is not sufficient.”
“They should also be selective when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of yourself, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at any given moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without the release of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the Clause, but later declared that it would be published on the website at a certain time.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the contents were presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief explanations.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the image of the President's meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by the press representatives of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, who called for more information.
Afterwards, Peru’s presidential office sent the media an e-mail with the “conclusion statement” of the summit, but it was Humala’s statement and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was just as little published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of The Hague that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are presently presenting to this International Court of Justice,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and continues to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious error, agreeing to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 following the ouster of its president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state issued the final document announcing that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we will expand the decisions on residency rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant steps, but should serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, which are located on the transaxles of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and of which two should provide for a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The concluding document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully deal with the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),” Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the ministers of defence of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency of the regional bloc for the time being.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that would advance the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we South Americans always sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been “reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his procedure would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to undergo an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be compromised.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a mild lung problem, but not a serious one," the head of state said.
However, there was a risk that he would suffer physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter with which he could find to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities Leper's wiki, he underlined that it was a solution for the legal authorities of Europe.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is conducting a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
And "if the UK grants this free letter this morning, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interviewed Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as allowed by Swedish jurisprudence and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the evil intent, and the lies that deter free expression.”
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador would no longer be dominated by such journalists “and neither by the bankers nor by hegemonic and skeptical countries,” and assumed that in a re-election, he would “deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the body "must remain hard and not allow opportunism or a legally disguised coup d'état," because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime legal boundaries between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies when both countries commit themselves to accepting the judgment, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility of him running for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean in any way a relapse in the health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today attended the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death from AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed HIV positive.
“It was as if a bomb had struck,” he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor “attempted to weaken without detectable success.”
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is also possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG in April, where he was quoted as saying in this year's information of the HCG, Villanu and Jaime Verrade.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life of the degree of impairment of the immune system of the people at the beginning of the treatment would have depended on the age of 50 years, and that at the beginning of treatment, Zhang did not depend on a greater than 30 years of drug use.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who is diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25, in this sense, "can easily turn 75 years old as long as he is under control," explained this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is still true that since the publication of the AIDS database, it has been estimated that 60 percent of patients in the national population have died of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, there were 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not had any problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infectious state, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is required, which is why all people who need it must be offered massive screening tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) have already agreed to this proposal, as well as patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this was the only reason that he had made such a friend of
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die, and don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather burst three times,” they say in my case.
The change was for the better, I diet well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," counts Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who today have AIDS in the context of the worldwide Anxiety Day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly as all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are big gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the designated locations, “the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were handed out individually, now they give us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need these?" is a common mock question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, which young people do not want to expose themselves, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the shop table, but in dispensers in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each case registered.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of Vitro Group’s liabilities that was achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent is created for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has payment problems.
Thus, one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bancarrotas District Court for the Northern District of Texas results in the Mexican companies being unhelpfully exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit first says that the main proceedings deal with the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a facilitator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the debts in the bankruptcy estate that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the debts.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Bankruptcies).
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have gone 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation starting in 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family lodges an objection before the same Court of Appeal for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court, will be lodged.
The seriousness of this case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act are described, and in which it is pointed out that it had strictly adhered to the terms of the United States.
It is also noted that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the Mexican air traffic unions failed to press charges against former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded by
At a meeting this weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been filed, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of free expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world champion of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as a lower-class player, first national league player, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
“My whole life I’ve been wearing a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife, for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it was as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would have provided for another.
He was awarded the championship of the vaqueros with gausse, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we took fourth place, which should have been bronze if it hadn’t been for this Canadian referee who had us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won at the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) with the team again, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was not involved in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, deceitful and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He turned 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Harvest Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS television series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create anticipation for an episode full of emotions where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at the time.
When the answer was announced in a November 1990 chapter, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers turning "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby), who shot.
J.R. had pregnant her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a contemptuous businessman and unfaithful husband who aspired to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instruct him.
"I know what's on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a “huge personality on and off the screen.”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world, and he remains in our hearts for those who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann’s loss would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I'm advising them, giving them courage, I'm meeting with them when their operations are coming and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "End of the World"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have dubbed “Deudarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
“I didn’t notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply called "The End of the World".
“We’re not recording 2012 so we always have the option to hold the course again in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent demise", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is being conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to “continue working until the night when the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers’ Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, says he’s seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class where this is being taught,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed—and least of all a professor—explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecies of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Somewhere else people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of by the last court, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
