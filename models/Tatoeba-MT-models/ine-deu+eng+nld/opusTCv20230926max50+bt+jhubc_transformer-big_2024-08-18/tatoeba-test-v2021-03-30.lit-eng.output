She didn’t like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
That won't change anything.
Do what you want.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf despite the rain.
What is the test?
He told me the story of his life.
I decided to be happy because it is good for my health.
I'll wait here for him to come back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in it?
What do you see?
This is not what you think!
You can buy a dog for yourself in that store.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It is simple and intuitive.
How many hours per week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They don't help.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who came first.
Sooner or later we will all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly with me.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn’t go on.
Probably not.
I want that too!
She looks but doesn't see anything.
You can’t eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I would like to travel around the world.
Do you like the Italian language?
I was given five years in prison.
I didn't win.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to hurry.
Oh, please?
No matter which team wins the game.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and get to your car.
Bring her a plate of lettuce.
We're at war.
She didn't answer.
I've heard that Mary wants a divorce.
Is this a squirrel or a squirrel?
Tomorrow, my father will be back home.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never give up hope.

When I was in high school, I sang every day at six o’clock in the morning.
You guys are the best shooters.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful! Be careful!
You've obviously done this before.
Did you receive a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn’t play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
It's your fault.
She rejected my request.
Who do you give preference to?
I love the Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what will happen in the future.
We made squirrel-shaped cookies.
Everybody likes dolls.
What did you do to deserve this?
Take a look at the example at the top.
Her book looked very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Could it be the 9th?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here yet?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence to that on the board.
She met him with joy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don’t expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf on Sundays.
Be creative .
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly with me.
Isn't it a great morning?
At least it's a story.
I have more and more curly hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm incapacitated.
The sky is blue.
The old woman collapsed and could not get up.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
You can use my vocabulary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
You're Tom's favorite.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Tom began to call for help.
His son is eight years old.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me that he would be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the gunshot?
I forgot to buy a pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't leave now, we're getting ready for lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old fool.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom does not speak English.
The school is five miles from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all of our food?
I know her bread will taste good.
Please come over.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, spitting on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit in a chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Evil sometimes wins.
Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I do not understand the German language.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
It's your fault.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are sweeter.
What's in there?
I am studying the Japanese language.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a snake.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I am afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't, then let's go.
What's going on with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France for a vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You are an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
At least it's history.
Are you involved in any sport?
It’s time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
The girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you’ll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don’t know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All your cats are grey.
I still remember the days when we were preparing an uprising with you.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There is nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know that I know.
Go home at six o'clock.
Bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don’t want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles illuminated the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I eat an apple.
A lonely person gets pleasure from watching ants.
Who is the man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are You Pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps accelerated.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
Do you need a car?
Take off your hat when you go to class.
They are no longer just complaining.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
Listen to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How's it going?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn’t stop thinking about Mary.
I think we need to call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You'll have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everyone knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tomas disappears.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs sleep on their mother’s carpet.
Tom has already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you can always adopt.
That's what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn’t get on the bus.
They need friends.
Meat, please.
Can you wrap it as a gift?
Do you like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Do you really not have a home?
Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is a Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are a lot of wineries in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
My parents were expecting too much from my son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, judge!
You can sit in a chair.
Where do you live if you don’t have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students love the English language.
The test was so difficult that we didn’t have enough time to finish it.
That's it.

This is our home now.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.

John is a professor of French literature at the University of Oxford.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They cheated on you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm an Irishman.
This is the man I was waiting for.
He did not pay the debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone, except her, smiled.
The queen stood next to the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She is my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Tom looks different.
What is the room rental price?
We have to get out of here.
Tom never wants to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They do not pose a threat.
Her advice prompted me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does this tour visit?
It started to get very wet, which is why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight you look just lovely.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom was dressed up.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to burn.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember if the room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories to women.
I don't like to make mistakes.
It's not theirs.
I'm not used to getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so hard.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He will do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
This tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the reading room.
How are you, ma'am?
I exchanged yen for dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where'd you put them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher is saying.
Why doesn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She literally translated it.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.

No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just respond to the hearing.
I never want to be indebted to anyone.
Take a look at the train crossing the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm ninety-five.
Her writing seemed to be funny.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this costume just for this occasion.
It is similar.
Be careful, all right?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I really like that.
He'll need help.
I've printed a hundred pages.
I see and I hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I've been in bed all day.
The war halted their investigation.
When spring comes, the days become longer day after day.
I listen to the radio.
Sweet Dreams!
Leave my car alone.

I should have come earlier.
Tom eats only what he wants to eat.
Who stole the apple?
He lost his ticket to the cinema.
What would you do if you were in his place?

What's the reason?

She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They had a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank a beer and pretended to be very drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a personal guard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her walk into the park.
I don't think you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It is low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was annoying.
He's a lot smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem to be interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog is trying to escape.
Like I said, I’m not going to do anything.
After that, there is a small brown puppy on the table.

Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She disappeared without any documents.
I am often here.
She continued her speech.

Mary is a bookkeeper.
Have a nice weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Go waste your time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
Wanting to be happy is normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
My hand hurt last night.
If I'd been rich, I'd have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My dad doesn’t eat a lot of fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished me a good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I will stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is this the real truth?
She's crying.
I'll see you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
That's half nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.

Take a photo of him!
Your brother wasn't in school today.

Write a pencil.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Anyone who can go in the wrong direction will go in the wrong direction.

Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't swim in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought that I was very tired.
I don't think she wants to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows that Mary likes him.
I like this music.
She's scared of a dog.
He went to the store, but stopped at her house.
The snow is falling quickly.
We're having lunch here.
Of course, I should read this book.

She testified against him.
My father grows rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I went through the window.
The meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Why don't you turn on the light?
He no longer trusts the doctor.
This was the first time I visited a museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom will want to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window but didn’t see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Tom never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
When left alone, the child will feel lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please keep going.
He was busy.
I am a widow.
I saw him.
I'm teaching Lo<0xC5><0xBE>bano.
“Good morning,” Tom said, smiling.
My hand hurts.
He needs ladders.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to make your own life path.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He slipped and almost collapsed.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy at the moment?
I'll take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I came in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote down our names.
My son died during the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go.
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is brilliant is simple.
Her students are learning too much.
Tom raised his hand.
We're going to have lunch.
The birds flew to the south.
This tea is very tasty.
I disagree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a wonderful idea.
He is very proud of his toy.
That's enough for now.
I'm not scared at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania accedes to the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where is the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a postman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took a piece of chalk.
Let me do this.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in the fresh air.
Have you ever taken up a saga?
It's snowing hard.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she does?
He came here before the end of the class.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and didn’t want to get down.
There are several good hotels in the city.
Where did this letter come from?
He doesn’t want to study today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn’t do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is fun.
She's here?
I don't like to make mistakes.
Be careful, all right?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's not a method, it's a provocation.
Please answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off the ladder.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Bob was washing the dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he is three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What is your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Haven't you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Tom is going to die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are a basketball player.
These clothes are right for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know that you are stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can’t leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom couldn't find a reason why he had to go home early.
Raise your hand.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think you're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd pick up another one later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Have a great day!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city center.
