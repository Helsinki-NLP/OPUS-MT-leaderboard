And they’re worried they’ll be a ‘true mirror’
Some ACs are concerned about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Welsh Member of Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly in Wales.
Across the political spectrum, ACs are concerned that this could be a matter of embarrassment.
Labour's AC said his group was concerned because the title "did away with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: you don't want to be called by that name.
He said the group was "unhappy" with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was keeping an "open mind" about the name change, but it was suggested that there is not much difference at stake between MWP and "Muppet".
The translation of the ASC into Welsh does not cause so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, it will be a matter for the members themselves to make the final decision on any descriptions of the titles of Members of the Assembly."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on the proposals. There was widespread support for calling the assembly in Senedd Cymru.
As for the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but the MWP came out strongly in the public consultation.
According to the rumor, ACau suggests other options, but the work of coming to consensus could cause the President, Elin Jones, a head coach. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes in weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the plan works, including rules on the ineligibility of ACs and the design of the committee's system.
The ACs will have the final vote on what they should be called as they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
This popular vote was formed in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighbouring country that has its own country called Macedonia.
Athens has repeatedly demanded that the name of its northern neighbours represent the right of its territory. It has opposed the country's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO rounds.
Giorgi Ivanov, the Macedonian president, opposes the country's name change vote and has said he will disregard the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church in Harlem is facing difficulties.
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I've spoken to," Adams said.
Today, it's the same."
He said that he could understand why the bars had disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Right now, bars are not considered in community living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money obtained by selling assets will not last as long as the leaders expect him to, "and sooner or later, they will be back in the same old situation."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums full of the kind of people that will not help the rest of the area's shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all these churches will close soon because it is unlikely that most of these people who move to the condominium will come from this area."
The two churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshipping nearby came into possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was transferred to a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a folio of the retailers on 125th Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to employ or raise black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's nuns made plans for rebuilding, the claws were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a follower of St. Martin's Church, was proud to call them the "poor cries."
The expert who sang the bells in July gave them another name: "Cultural treasure" and "unique historical treasure."
Also, the specialist, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first cliques in the world to be sung by black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved on to sing the more cliques at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church had no one in its place.
What has happened in St. Martin's church in recent months has been a complex history of priests and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's lay leaders, and others by the diocese.
The festival - the governing body of the pilgrimage which includes lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to indicate concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the festival, although the pilgrims had not been involved in the pilgrimage.
Some pilgrims complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured when he drowned in search of a chemist in California.
According to officials, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday while he was swimming to search for chemicals in California, on the first day of the chemicals' season.
The attack happened just before 7am near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Then, he swam to him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought he was excited when the boy got up to start. But, after the boy arrived, Hammel told him "I realized he was screaming, 'I've been beaten up!
I've been beaten!"
The bridge of his shoulder was torn open."
I called out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’ said Hammel.
The boy was picked up from the water in a helicopter and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in serious condition.
We don't know what kind of sarcasm was responsible for the attack.
In a letter to the media, the life-saver, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said that the victim had suffered harmful injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas. This was done for 48 hours for security and investigation purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of squirrels in the area but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty icons in the form of department stores that include specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn market that is still growing even though fashion sales and home goods are declining, the larger beauty dolls will be treated in 11 retail outlets across the country. If they are not the most expensive, they will be given away.
This investment comes in a world of beauty as supermarkets search for ways to use empty shelves after being tracked for TV sets, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique colour collection so that most of the product is suitable for vegans - something that is more and more called for among young shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop retailer will be testing concessions at two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has been supplying Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also delivered a number of Habitat outlets since she bought the two chains two years ago. It says that this has boosted food sales and ensured acquisitions are more profitable.
He was unable to make a previous effort to rewrite his beauty and pharmacy segments.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership came to an end following a dispute over how to share the profits of the pharmacy's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, the chain owner of Lloyds Pharmacy. The business consisted of 281 stores and was sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as he would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty helmets to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in co-workers who have been specially trained and will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands have been designed to satisfy all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a destination of essential beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones cancels Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, broke up after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand additions and home goods.
The couple's business has been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, one of This Morning's presenters, had posted a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is retiring after Holly Willoughby pulled out of their brand-name business a profitable way of life at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "confused" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new agreements - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she didn't have enough brand and time for their Truly
The business had been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was said to be doubling Willoughby's fortune, an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly it was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her future in the long run and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and she was so close to the launch.
There is a full warp of goods in the headquarters in Marlow, and those are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's most bankrupt stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products, including helmets, lamps, clothing and household goods. This could mean more
This may also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Truly founded with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source who is friends with Jones said, "We won't pay any attention to his business issues."
It was difficult, of course, ‘and then we fell in love’
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media for making "non-presidential" remarks, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was joking about the news.
"I didn't give up anything."
Kim said he wanted to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward in North Korea's denunciation.
However, the debates on decommissioning have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not believe the UDA is a good fit.
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was a lot more faithful in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results - ceasing to test rockets, helping to free hostages and ensuring that the rest of America's soldiers return home.
He went on to justify his unusual way of acting in terms of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this full arena, we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesian Earthquake Destroys Island, Killing Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been deported, a national disaster has not been declared, something that is necessary to catalyze international support.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have clarified that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is quite challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children are creating a team to travel to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given support.
Because the earth is constantly raining in Indonesia, the country is never ready enough for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
It seems that a herring was not found warning about the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been given, and that has contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia at its best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat the earthquake's victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has focused on improving the race infrastructure of Indonesia in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a blow to Mr. Joko's administration as he faces a re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from long-standing denominations in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form on the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dispersed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other irresistible weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool, scoring an equal goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge stopped Liverpool from losing a Premier League game to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was downed by Xherdan Shaqiri and he was about 30 inches from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left before shooting towards the farthest post.
The ball rose high above the box as she moved towards the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and dropped the ball to the net.
"I tried to go to that site and get hold of the ball and players like Shaq always play when possible, so I tried to create as much time as I could for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and kicking the ball without thinking too much about it, just going for it."
Half time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star from Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The shooter from the Chelsea team passed the ball with his saddle back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away in the middle of the field and sprinting into half Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a bass ‘chicken and go’ fast in the middle of the field.
Then. kicked the ball forward smoothly between the defenders of the other team, leading Hazard to the boxing.
Hazard was earlier than the defender and ended up in the net of the farthest post with his left foot chic past Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool are playing against Napoli in a group game in the High Council at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The total number of deaths following the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was noted that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell when the magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck on Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a conference.
The city of Palu, which contains more than 380,000 people, was covered with demolished buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into a murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Penbedw, Dewdwy Coast, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area to let them know if they have heard or seen anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'While the investigation is only just beginning, I would ask anyone in the John Street area in England to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on dashboards, they should contact us for fear that they have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Penbedw area and that her body has been found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing and the police say they are informing the victim's immediate relationship.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews is trying to return to his apartment but police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't have any words when he heard it.
Residents are now told that they will have to wait a few hours before they can get back in.
One of the police officers was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
The woman reached the spot in her tears.
She keeps repeating ‘this is so terrible’.
At 2 p.m., two police officers were in the cordon and another was outside.
A number of officers were standing in the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information will be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with a record number of 247 30 September.
Cromwell sculpture outside the Senedd is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘revamping history’ fraternity
Removing the statue would be a virtuous justice for the atrocious destruction that it caused to so many cultural and religious artifacts in England, a destruction done by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of "truths" that "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current debate about removing sculptures, that Oliver Cromell's figure outside St. Stephen's Balas would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for the carrying out or ordering of the Echoclassic of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft from Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century opinion and is part of the figure-histoire that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "A number of people, more in the 19th century than possible today, regard Cromwell as a figure who protected the parliament from external pressure, namely the kingdom in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not, but it's an ongoing debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has guided the development of our country since then and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure representing one side of the debate.
His accomplishments as Lord of the Rings deserve to be celebrated and remembered as well."
Rheibus pig kills a farmer in China
A pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, known by his nickname ‘Yuan’, had been found dead near a pork trough in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His arteries were broken and he was bleeding.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines on a small farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai County, China.
According to the rumor, he had travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 bucks in the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and noticed that the door of a neighboring pig's colt was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the trough and there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had torn the farmer to death, according to the report.
"The legs of my hip had been torn and they were all blood," said the heel, which was dubbed by its nickname, "Wu," according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan reaching the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his baby.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan and his family were not the animals of the animal that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on the site.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market authorities are discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig held a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightens the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his bee in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that bloody taste can cause them to behave like this.
"They're cheesy.
They're young, very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
"You have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
The rest of the storm causes heavy rain over a large area of the southwestern United States
According to the forecasts, the Rosa Storm is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, the storm will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mya winds, Category 1 Wind, from 5am ahead of Eastern time on Sunday. The wind was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastwards toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a thunderstorm, the storm will begin to push its trough-heated tide to a tropical depression.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will react with the approaching background causing heavy rain over the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause severe dangerous flooding, a flux of rubble and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Expect as much as between 2 and 4 inches of hand in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
It is possible that large flooding with the conditions will deteriorate rapidly due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unwise to venture out into the desert on foot with a threat from a tropics hand.
Heavy rain could cause the reservoirs to become wild rivers and a storm of lightning and thunderstorms will cause strong winds and dust gusts in the area.
The approaching basin will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the South California coast.
It is possible that a total of more than half an inch of hand will fall, which could cause a small flow of rubble and swollen roads.
This would be the first rain in the area during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical rainforests will begin arriving in Arizona in the late evening of Sunday and early morning on Monday, before the rains spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change enormously throughout the U.S. during the month of October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature throughout the U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference in temperature between the City of Kansas, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer warmth will try to rise and expand again.
A large portion of central and eastern USA is expected to start hot for October with the temperature in the 80s from the Southern Hemispheres to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance for temperatures higher than the average for the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are watching Brett Kavanaugh's audition
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, nominee for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, giving evidence, on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters upsetting normal programs to broadcast the unexpected time it was found on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, indicates that the FBI will conduct an investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her inappropriately and tried to remove his clothes at a party at the high school, and he was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in giving his testimony that it certainly didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company accounted for the average number of the audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not directly available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And usually Nielsen has some sort of trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To give a perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's opinion guests have given strong support to appoint Kavanaugh, who led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest following the hearing as well.
Flake was the most prominent figure in the play on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republicans announced that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was arrested on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to enter a lift to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood looking down at the floor for a few minutes as he got his head full, live on TV on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have the power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all filmed live hours later, when it was time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senedd.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominees by the following week, a result that minority Democrats have been encouraging.
Flake was partially persuaded after a conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
AS British May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the bid.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her interview on the front page of the new paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticized what she calls the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was "all laughable" for the EU to hate her bid.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Simpson Dyteon on suspicion of killing one of LSU's players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to jail on suspicion of a second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims have lost their glasses during the fact.
The police found the glasses on the site and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on it, the CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a fund of $350,000, the petitioner said.
The East Baton Rouge Pollution Chief's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying that a head-to-head shot into the neck is the cause of the death.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's refugee enlistment, the state's police crime laboratory, the University of the South's police and local citizens for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the team for enforcing the area's law for its "durability and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-and-six-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and that they were "terrible" after hearing about Wayde's death.
It's the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
Fireworks spreading the flames over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters had warned the people of Mexico on Saturday not to go near the burn site after the activity increased in the cave and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of fundraisers and drills.
Images on social media showed thin layers of dust covering front car windows in Mexico City's neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Officials have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The burner is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists before celebrating a year since the vote for independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with the anti-terror police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote to secede.
A group of people in mudguards who were in favour of segregating the anti-war police holding them back with eggs and powder paint, created dark clouds of dust in the streets that would usually be crowded with tourists.
There were clashes later in the day as well, with the police using their batons to control the fighting.
Over the course of several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't forgive" and union protesters were shouting "There is a life for Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received in the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions are still high in this area that has its time on independence, a year after the 1 October referendum which Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who are separatists.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but many people did not come to vote and those who were against segregation had significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
There were groups in favor of independence camped on Friday night to stop the protests in favor of the national police.
The protest went ahead, but he was forced to follow up with another trio.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the separatists with his wife, he was no longer a believer in gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry with joy when they were able to vote but we are now back in the same old situation," he said.
Although they managed to win a small but vital victory in the regional elections in December of last year, groups that are in favour of independence have found it difficult to keep the momentum to go this year and many of their most well-known leaders have either failed to help themselves or have abandoned themselves.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been disturbing the waters during the collision.
"The misery is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Was Driven Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and to the building itself.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot at the top of the car.
Menga's shot secured a 1-0 victory for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal over Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to the Hibernian level in an instant.
Gerrard's team is not winning a game away from home in this season's Premier League and they face the Hearts on next Saturday, which is at the top and eight points ahead of them.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host a game against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has beaten six consecutive games in the sub-division, and head coach Holt hasn't lost a game since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chances against visitors
Holt's team should have been at the forefront long before they scored and their direct nature was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but dragged his effort across the goal face, then Alan Lithgow couldn't but aim his effort broadly after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's pass across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the others in certain places.
And that's how the goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers were in possession of the ball but couldn't break through the home team's defenders and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't worry much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Outan McGregor, the Rangers goalkeeper, and Lithgow kicked the ball widely from another set play by Livingston.
Crusaders came to the Livingston foxes continuously and they continued to be cleared, and were given two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged former player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - they were disregarded.
‘Awesome Performance’ by Livingston –
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at Arena Tony Macaroni
It's an amazing performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise the expectations on this up-and-coming path.
Their style of play and staff haven't changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be praised for the way he has inspired the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, arranging an extremely orderly defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have much of a spirituality.
Although they have played well at times under Gerrard's control, the standards of these were not visible.
They had a great deal of grip on their last ball - they only opened the side at home once - and it was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
"Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne"
It was a blue sky and everyone was whistling on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come to the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Hearers – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
These protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Car accident in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
A biker has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place several months after another cyclist died in a ‘carry-and-flight’ accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and let his closest relative know.
Road closures and referrals have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been injured in an accident
Six officers have been injured in an accident in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The incident took place at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the ordeal, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in only one vein.
The small injuries that the officers had on their faces on the site were treated.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Prison Service said: "Prison staff with specialist training have gone there to deal with this event that continues at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison."
His Majesty's Long Lartin Jail includes more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was said that the governor of the prison had been treated in the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October of last year, anti-terrorism officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious accident where the staff were attacked with a pole ball.
Rosa Storm at the Great Flood Threat in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Elwa Dry Areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the rest of the Rosa Storm travels across the Southwest of the Desert, causing the risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep an eye on major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into the right and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning hands late on Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones that have maintained storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of AZ's borders."
The latest models of the National Center on Storms predict between 2 and 4 inches of hand, with a few examples of a total of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogullon Range.
Other areas in the Southwest of the Desert including the Great Basin and the Rockies in the middle are likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with several cases of a total of up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa rain can be of benefit to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because of the current dry conditions in the Southwest.
"According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought at least, the highest category of only one," the report said.
At first, the Rosa Trail will lead to land along the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, who was still as strong as Sunday morning's storm with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean so it weakens.
Because of this, the storm is expected to reach the land in Mexico at the strength of a thunderstorm in the afternoon or on Monday night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of hand is expected from Baja California into northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will travel north across Mexico as a thunderstorm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and to the right of Utah arriving late in the night of March.
"The main danger to be expected from Rosa or the remnants of the storm is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Desert," the National Center on Storms said in a statement.
This rain is expected to create large floods that can endanger life as well as a rush of rubble in the desert and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Norton Midsomer Attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital and remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officials have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone from what happened to present that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has 'suffered from hatred and anger' of Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to renounce the Democratic Party's indiscreet and shameful tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and was under the impression of denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually abused decades ago, and both in their fifties.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of America have seen the greatness and standard and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"I voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh in a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our lifetime, a lawyer with an outstanding history of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in North Virginia.
The President unambiguously referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican Assembly in the mid-term elections.
"It's been five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not trying, but I'm really trying," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere trying to fight for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats' mission is to "resist and block."
The first key procedural vote on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds are being killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom have been wiped out as massive waves cut off the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters fell on the beach late at night, sweeping many away and killing and damaging anything along the way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the warning about yesterday's tsunami was received, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they did not run from there immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster relief agency in Jakarta, Indonesia.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, ponchos, houses, it was hitting everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 mph (497 mi) before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had fallen and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that included 2.4 million people.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and shallow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as one "healing" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings that had fallen, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the earthquake's summit.
"There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information," Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a disaster ready, but the situation could get worse," he said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had arrived at the time the warning was announced.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man on a high floor can be heard shouting at people on the street below warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water was hitting the shore, carrying buildings and drives from there.
Reuters was not able to validate the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electrical outage that extinguished communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but there is a real need for food and other essentials on those who have had to leave their homes.
The city's airfield has only been reopened for support efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
She's a terrible situation.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers are sheltered in tarpolin shelters set up in their office yard, they have passed torturous views on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen a lot of houses being destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as support groups embark on the relentless process of providing emergency support, some have complained that specialist foreign support workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened again.
"It's still a disaster at the state level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Right, this is a national disaster,' we can get international support, but there is no status yet."
As she spent the night in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing were hoping that their loved ones would live through some miracle, which would relieve some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the closet.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to release a woman who had been held under rubella for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paralysis team, had trained two of the missing paralyzers for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandadi said that his disciples are among those who are seated in the Roa Roa lodge.
"As someone with experience in the field of paralysis, I have my own emotional branch," he said.
During the hours after the parade community heard about the news that the Roa Roa Hotel has collapsed, Mr Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the beach party.
But there was only one gray tick next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages haven't been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as ATM machine gets refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from one of Brink's employees who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on the Leveee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man "runned behind the Brink worker" and stole a bag of money that was to be provided.
Witnesses saw many other people fleeing the site, according to the statement, but the police did not identify the number that was part of the incident.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapist Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been called Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He is going to the show instead of Ariana Grande, the singer from America who pulled back because of "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
In addition to being a student of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, who delivers on the radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're this.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to God alone – reflecting the good, the bad and the evil, everything.
It's more than a reflection of who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had a variety of names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has also been using his name by varying in terms of heft and capitals.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use soldiers against citizens
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use soldiers against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody revenge against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to defeat the people of Mexico."
Soldiers fired during a peaceful protest on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when left-wing student movements were rooted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the young people of Mexico by providing support to those who study and open more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are attracted to crime gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the money it spends on research in the field, said investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make announcements about artificial understanding, although the U.S. does not have a formal artificial understanding strategy in general.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, its goal of being the best country in terms of all innovations by 2030.
"Securing double the funding for research work in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of artificial intelligence."
Doubling the funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next big achievement in the field of artificial understanding is being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is Chief Executive of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best Othello player in America. Later he became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competitions as the Higher Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge in the field of Defense, and asked when the next would be to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win grants from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been trying to hire bright alumni from universities to work on artificial intelligence recently.
Lee also said that changes to the moving policy could help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically offered to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Council of the State of China announced its Next Generation Artificial Understanding Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Institute provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Institute and other governmental institutions give money to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of the work is China's academy.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense co-founded the Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment in an enterprise called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research on artificial understanding.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in effect for months.
Macedonian Citizens Vote in Referendum on Change of Country
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia," which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a country called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's most important Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to focotitute has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the question I voted for in the referendum: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the only developing countries to have fallen Yugoslavia, has access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live free under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," said Georgijevska, 79.
Although they are not legally bound, many members of parliament have said they will be waiting for the result of the vote in order to make it a definite vote.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds would have to be in the parliament.
The county's election commission said there was no mention of any inconsistencies by 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of the voters who had registered to vote took part.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would mean the country could join NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents that had been set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the ability to hold our heads high, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have courage.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a NATO member will ensure the investment he really needs on Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would "confirm our future."
According to a vote set up last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum - which is less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of the West since it took the reins in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, City of Manchester, pass all Brighton defenders and get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeat Brighton defenders during the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look awfully easy as he scored in the 65th minute.
The sniper of the money was low in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed away before running earlier than many others on the side of Brighton's box.
Then he gave up on his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet," the manager of the City of Manchester, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We talked about how he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
"We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the province of Brighton that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the back side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Chelsea forward kicked the ball into the net before slipping over the boundaries.
The City of Manchester is playing against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals do not have the hope of competing in the second chance games, there is not much reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the tumpath on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in terms of second-chance games for the Rockies, which saves the Los Angeles Dodgers' lead from one game in the NL West league.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can cross the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and the other team will play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play a game like that?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but reportedly they are eager to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher playing for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout shots in 220 2/3 bats this season.
Trump's campaign in North Virginia
The President unambiguously referred to the situation surrounding his election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke about the importance of the Assembly of the Republic in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done in the month of November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not applying but I’m really applying, that’s why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump said, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group, you see this is happening this morning.
And they're determined to take the power back by using whatever way you need, you see the hatred, the malaise.
They don't care who gets hurt, who has to step on them to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and stop."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "skin and hate and hostile and liar."
He referred to the name of the high-level Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a high-pitched whistle was heard among the assembly.
Do you remember his answer?
"Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a second - that was an example of a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer an insidious thing.
They don't stand up for those who say it.
When the members of the executive team of Momentum in my local media voted to protect me, that was a big surprise.
After all, I'm the latest among many Labour ASs to hear that we're not welcome - and that's for saying us.
My parliamentary co-worker, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she stands firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the offer of punishment was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Disagree with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The announcement for the Nottingham Eastern Labour meeting on Friday stated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour AS, the GC meetings on Friday night have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in most of the meetings to date and we have long forgotten the promise of a "lovely, tenderer" policy, whether or not that has ever been achieved.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not supported in the Labour Party and that each viewpoint is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader. There were co-workers I used to think were from the same political ancestry as I was starting to expect me to do a pedo tour and support views that I would never have agreed with them otherwise - even if it were a song on a different note.
Whenever I speak in public - and there's no difference what I'm going to say in truth - it will lead to severe attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the center's politics, telling me not to vote.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my co-workers because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political ones.
I admire the professional and decisive nature of those co-workers who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but don't let that get the best out of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of perseverance.
In fact, we are not a party that is so vague right now and with every offer of "deficiency in confidence" or change to the rules of choice, the party becomes weaker.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years urging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion excessively, then I'd be "right."
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, having been troubled by the negligence of the Thatcher government, a government that was responsible for the torque condition of my entire school classroom. Since then I have been trying to promote the best services of the community.
I've never hid my politics, nor in the last election either.
No one in East Nottingham could have misunderstood my political views and the areas I disagree with in their circle with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my fidelity to the Labour Party leader with the country moving towards Brexit which will be a blow to households.
But, in fact, I don't have a message to Momentum Nottingham, but a message to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats from my non-election or political flexibility will prevent you from acting.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Father opens at the top
Two late applications may have proved some of the final result, but Ayr certainly deserves to win this Higher Tennent League game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team that hasn't hit out of the ten.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for maintaining the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to praise Father, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson applied in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, ensuring that Ayr was on the front. However, the yellow card that got the Scottish cap, Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors Bag, meant that Melrose could not take advantage of that.
Climo ensured that Ayr was never more ahead with a penalty kick, before he, before exactly half the time, scored and converted an individual application to secure a score of 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's application, which was converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was some delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and he was taken away on a stretcher. After they restarted, Ayr got more success following an application by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's interim captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and yet, Melrose made the additional player pay with an unconverted application by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for clamoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson threw the ball down behind Ayr's growing scarves.
Climo overturned the request, as he did again almost immediately after restarting, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's cock and sent Gregor Henry's frontman away from the home team's fifth request.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move into the hospitality industry after discovering he has been named a licensed food company director.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, as well as writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series underway will be the final series in the history of the show and it is likely that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but one of Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan hopes to be part of Glasgow's "blissful food business."
‘We are living in the sea’: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Sea
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of a regiment in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a blue flag like the sea.
Seaports from Lyn Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the signs: "The sea is not food by right.
It's a duty to restore it."
Bolivia has been surrounded and the memory of the sail lost to Chile in a bloody collision over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are clearer than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and for that reason it is faithful to wait for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia.
A number of Bolivian citizens will be watching the ruling of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's allegation - after decades of interlocutory talks - that Bolvia must be handed over to Chile.
Evo Morales, a charismatic president native of Bolivia - who faces a contentious battle for next year's re-election - relies heavily on the ruling on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and many would not change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has demanded that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests "that the case was not one complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean man who specializes in international law.
And instead of improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
"Bolivia's current administration has misjudged this issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has undermined any goodwill Chile had after, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the process of making court decisions is usually a rapid process.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of ties with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement over mobile benefits," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political bag.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific," he added.
This is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said his country will never get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the ball first trusts Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's only a dream come true that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declare an end to the Korean War will make the North resign.
Washington is avoiding agreeing to the statement before Pyongyang makes significant disproportionate moves first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second summit.
But there are many doubts about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons that the country, more than likely, considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Latest Collection Of Huge Pools Are About To Reach Your Big Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a variety of huge and spectacular costumes for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which shone on the set of stars at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the remarkable creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a sheet hat over the head decorated with a wide pleated edge covering the heads of the models.
Among the other great accessories were watermelons decorated with games, even a magic hat and a pendant - but these hats wouldn't heat your head.
Tom Browne also revealed a collection of strange jokes - and that at a good time for Winter's Eve.
Many of the colourful muzzles had their lips sewn together and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to a fine piece of work.
One of them was similar to a squash-blooming dress with a snorkel and a snout, and another looked like a ya honey cone, and that one had melted.
And, if you enjoy great fashion statements - this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on the style predict that huge ties could reach your big street.
These large hats follow the ‘La Bomba’ style, the popular grass hats with the two-foot wide edge, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these impractical hats seen on social media also had another great creation on the fashion platform - a straw bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit wearing it.
The burning orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia edge and a white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see big hats and beach bags arrive on the big street next summer - as the designer has made so much of an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the call for big accessories.’
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the examinations, which is only complemented by individual and joint success in the fields of sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a cutting-edge school curriculum, we see modern languages still being popular topics that are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, that will remain in their memory.
If you speak to someone in their own language, that will stay in the heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can rely on English only when trying to cultivate connections and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's examinations recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have received a high A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS, show that 72 percent of pupils received a High A grade in Mandarin, and that 72 percent of those who studied German had 69 percent of those who studied French and French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there are more calls for languages in order to prepare young people for their careers for the future.
With more proposed job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a world-wide environment. -
No matter what career a person chooses, if that person has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will step forward immediately.
According to a poll by YouGov which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent were unable to speak a foreign language good enough to hold a conversation. In addition, French was the only language spoken by a percentage of double figures, or 15 percent.
This is the reason why investing in language learning is important for children today.
The ability to speak a number of languages, especially languages of developing economies, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages they will be teaching.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking at 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages they can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who specialize in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what lies ahead.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in a global business environment, that languages are still essential for the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland.
LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the series before the start of the season Sunday at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It will be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, the Lakers' reporter, tweeted that James was likely to play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this time in my career, I don't need games before the season to prepare," he said.
Time Rally West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his election for the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking support for the mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The Trump rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings over his nomination to the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh, which is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to be confirmed in parliament postponed for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November to gain some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign said that the five rallyes over the next week would aim to "distribute volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to defend and add to the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to its agenda until the President travels to as many states and as many as possible as I can now begin the important campaign term," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, a rally tonight could include supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state that gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the pinnacle poles.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to give him a boost in the pineapple poles," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows the plow to fight ahead as they go to individual games on Sunday
After three single corner sessions, a quarter on Saturday afternoon could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been imagined in the sports world but it is a concept that players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So, where do they say the moment is right now?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four, so we've got a little bit of a moment to know," Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plane with another dozen to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their moods and have enough to cheer them on, especially from Speith and Justin Thomas who played together throughout the day and got three points out of four of the same.
He's been a great leader for you, and he's leading by example.
The screams of cheering went up as his round went on, succeeding with an essential pit to go on a game to four of the same although he was of and Thomas had been down two by two.
There was a similar scream after the pig that won the game for them on the 15th, the kind of scream that tells you he doesn't believe America is out of it yet.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game," Speith said.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the legendary story of the Ryder Cup.
There are four of them in Europe, and they can't do anything about it."
"Moliwood" was the only bar not to get bogged down on Saturday afternoon, and they didn't get bogged down on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon or the last nine on Friday morning either.
That run, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, would be the same player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as he falls over Le Golf National or Le Fleet.
If possible, they're both on the same page in different ways.
But it's too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat Sergio Garcia, a four-ball champion of the morning, easily when he was paired with Alex Noren.
In the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede were in a hole and did not come close to climbing out of it.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
There are four poles and the quads I'm interested in watching because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in a second.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and they are leading somewhat at the start of the last day, but the quarter-final session has proven that the U.S. team has the ability to fight, something some especially in the U.S. were suspicious.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four-ball games and four-match Saturday 10-6 ahead of the USA.
The incredible duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two wins over Tiger Woods to go and their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European coach Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the ball after losing at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. poor squad in the four morning balls going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the four quarters, but they couldn't get rid of the flaw.
Jim Furyk's cart needs eight points of 12 individual gems on a Sunday in order to keep the hustle.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been dubbed "Molliwood" after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to have four points out of their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After kicking Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they collaborated brilliantly to beat Woods on American wrestler Bryson Dechambeau of 5 and 4.
Wood, who won two games on Saturday, had some special opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who has been unflinching for the ball in the morning, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are the first and third in the world from 2 and 1.
It wasn't all about Europe on a nice and pleasant day in the west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later made yuro Polter and Rory McIlroy of 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup the team has come back from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although only an equal score is needed on the Furyk squad as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming to their senses on Sunday seems like he's beyond his ability.
North Korea says it won't unequivocally arm its father without confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the U.N.'s value to the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions are strengthening malice in the U.S. and the country will not be removing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea has taken "substantial goodwill steps" in the past year, such as putting an end to nuclear drills and drills, deploying a nuclear-powered, nuclear-powered test site.
But we don't see such a response from the U.S.," he said.
"No trust in the U.S. will be lacking in confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri has reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual response to de-nuclearisation where North Korea will be rewarded by taking gradual steps, his statement to see was significant as it did not reject the unified nuclear pact.
Mr. Ri referred to the joint statement between Mr. Kim John One and Mr. Donald Trum at the first conference between the current U.S. president and North Korea's ambassador to Singapore on June 12, where Mr. Kim vowed to work towards a "nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while countering the Korean Peninsula's nuclear threat."
North Korea has been trying to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls for the tightening of international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is calling for 'de-nullification first' and they are increasing the pressure through sanctions in order to reach their goal in a mandatory manner, and they are even opposing the 'declaration to end the war,'" RI said.
"The idea that sanctions can defeat us is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that sanctions continue to intensify our malice."
Mr. Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a summit the president had held in the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of nuclear deterrence and not the U.S., there would be no such thing as a naval paternity."
Despite this, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a self-identifying mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to de-arm, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until the end of the year.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a specific period for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that the United Nations General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: "Sanctions by the Security Council must be enforced rigorously and without fail until we are realizing and confirming a nuclear deadlock.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in order to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programs and missiles.
He met with Pompeo at the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in order to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go as well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying there had been progress, but North Korea accused him within hours of making "gangster-like orders."
North Korea has vowed to meet with Moon this month to decommission a missile site and a nuclear site if the U.S. takes "corresponding steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "comparative steps" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with the U.S.
Harvard students have a chance to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is being sub-graduates to sleep more in order to try to cope with the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
An academic has found that students in the world's best universities often misunderstand when it comes to educating essentials on their own.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham Hospital and Women who designed the course, believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired at the beginning of the course after giving a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only now learning this, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - it was a surprise to me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course still includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily practices.
‘We are aware that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what the impact of smoking is on your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being happy to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse,
It should ensure that you get enough sleep, and that quality, is a way for students to deal with stress, distress, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting pressure on, as lack of sleep makes the brain believe that you're sick.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical life, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after studying one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and was ‘inspired to try to get the course for the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive organisation.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider installing an alarm for going to sleep, as well as waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue lights’ that are released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect you too much.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard men
The Rangers suffered another bad game away from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's homeless team at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team had been looking for their first win on the road since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's team beat for no more than the second time in 18 games as a manager to leave the team eight points behind a senior league leader.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no sight of being able to come together.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone rises to third only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the painter Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after something was thrown from the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to reach the pre-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 who beat Hearts last week and would love the way his organized squad did to beat their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingstone did more with the belt when they had it.
They should have scored after only two minutes after Menga's passing gave Scott Pittman a chance at the goal of Outan McGregor but the midfielder methodd his chance by striking the goal clearly.
He made a deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs to find Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the clear at the back post.
The Rangers were in control but there was more hope than belief in playing them in the last game of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been kicked out of the spot within a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombians' appeals.
The Rangers scored two shots for the target in the first half but found former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly not having trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's advance and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes has been against the run of the game, no one can argue that they were not worthy of their hard work alone.
Yet, Rangers methodd and dealt with Jacobs' deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the bell to Scott Robinson, who was uneasy as he passed to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was like a rookie as he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and almost the change had an immediate effect as the forward passed to Morelos but Kelly ran off his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt could have added to their score in the last minutes but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow failed to score from the corner.
Rangers second-rounder Glenn Middleton had another application for a kick from the spot after hitting Jacobs but Thomson once again ignored the application.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
And now a page from our Almanac "Bore Sol": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in CUMBER... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring polarity, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Meter also became an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "Measuring Geiger, it's being used to find strategic mines, like a uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that are released by the radiation in the mines."
Evans: "Well, he's making a lot of noise!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adjusting them in a laboratory
Then they will be able to ‘see’ a protein that is common in several cancers and they will be re-injected
Testing of the vaccine shows hopeful results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw your opaque cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adapting them in a laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2 that is common in several cancers, and then re-spraying the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, opaque, squamous and colon/equine cancer, excerpts from Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began speaking in favor of Trump by wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't go well
Kanye West was teased at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a shock performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third by that night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cop, he rowed against the Democrats and reiterated his support of Trump.
"I'm going to be talking to a white person and they're going to say, 'How can you like Trump, he's of our race?
"If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a video from West was uploaded to social media by the debugger Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They were putting me in the back of the room.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that cap on.’
They were trying to get me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then after the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that it would "set my superman log forward, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to find love."
His comments were echoed at least twice by an SNL audience and cast members were shocked to see, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "The studio all went completely quiet."
West had been added as a late second to singer Ariana Grande, as her former lover the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West caused a number of upsets by performing the I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the strongest characters: THANK YOU FOR WORKING."
But the presenter Karen Hunter stated that West is only "knowing himself and that's great."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their "organ") who, in my opinion, embraces and expresses ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
He is with his rapper, Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and of course the late Prince musician changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Ynadon Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington kills a venomous woman
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed on the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys feel they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked how to tackle and challenge a venomous male in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married all of her actresses on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also aged 31, recently admitted that he felt strongly about tackling the problem.
'I feel strong at the moment - what's gone wrong with a man?' he said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grow up, in terms of the problem we have now?’
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the progress in venomous males and that's because of the very masculine characters.
He went on to say: ‘What is wise and what is taught?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel that they have to be a special kind of man?
In my opinion, this is one of the big questions of our life - how do we change that?
"It's obvious that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not make any other Game of Thrones programs when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he had ‘enough of fighting and horses’.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, a story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come from Game of Thrones.
“I met a woman on the program, so in a way my family gave me, and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the cases were transmitted through some form, noting a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people who catch HIV like this has been reduced by almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan state.
But, year on year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased from 100,000 people.
HICV transmission through some kind of a major problem in China's HDT community.
The community was decriminalised in 1997, but according to the legend, discrimination against LGBT people is a rift.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of the infections as a result of insufficient sexual safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has released data from Republican lawmakers, killing 'dangerous legends' and 'conspiracy theories'
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat demanded that the accusations be spread by "extreme right-wing" voters.
"Lies, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The online information spread on Thursday, after it was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a panel of the Senedd on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState published that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is related to Waters' office and they released information from a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is false and a naked lie," Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and incorrect allegations - was not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
This unfounded accusation is false and a naked lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by a former press secretary at the White House's Ari Fleischer.
"It's annoying," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the nature to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
They can't be hereditary.
They can't answer the defendant's question.
They have to be quiet and uneasy."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters's response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by judges of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and the agency to enforce the law on the deceptive allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," he said, "and that they are responsible for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - parody weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British twist and to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way to make sure that we don't have a new generation in the future?
However, the Johnny English no-fly has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second time - with its name more than nothing to show that it's a comic character created for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, this is the real spy who, despite his bona fide allegations, includes a little Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to by Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally based on the traveler and the mysterious man Atkinson was playing in a Barclaycard advertisement, leaving destruction behind him.
There are one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English film.
I was delighted to see Johnny English going towards a trucker wearing an armor and the blades of the rotor hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's talent with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor is weak and strangely unnecessary, especially now that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's real regrets aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's character.
The idea is that the UK is in big trouble.
A cyber hacker has turned to Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identity of all the spies Britain has in the field, despite the fact that the undersecretary is on duty - an unfortunate and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step to a self-righteous and surrounded prime minister who already suffers from huge political apathy. Emma Thompson does her best with the character Teresa Maya but is not great at the script to work with .
Her secret information consultants inform her that all the spies have been put at risk and that she will be able to come and have someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolteacher in some big organization now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English offers a school of espionage similar to the School of f Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, the role in which Vicki Pepperdine is transported.
So the Batman and Robin get things wrong back at the service of Her Majesty, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being teased by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can deal with British computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their laughing journey: dressed as servers, they set a huge French restaurant on fire; create havoc while trying to go on a happy Volta ship; and English causes a complete mess in trying to use a Volta True-to-Fair tool.
They make a very show of it in the last scene, but while so fun and unrealistic, there's a little bit of a sense of children's television about it all.
It's very real.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: can the British film industry not give a role to Rowan Atkinson who makes a fair play with his talents?
The Labour Party denies it is preparing a scheme for British people to work for four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical scheme that would mean that the British people work a week of four days - but are paid for five.
According to the statement, the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution onwards to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that workers get a three-day weekend - but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Congress of Labor Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but a four-day week is a ambition that aligns with the party's attitude towards restructuring the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, the ambition is not fully accepted by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: ‘A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.’
Chancellor of the opposition John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to expand his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from ‘named directors’ and ‘proxies’ of the public resource companies.
The opposition’s chancellor’s plans also mean that existing water companies’ shareholders will not be funded in full as the Labour government could make ‘deductions’ on the basis of apparent evil.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and created Comprehensive Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of company equity in the hands of workers; the private sector would have annual shares of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question that the FBI's findings could cause any Republican MP to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked U.S. Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, I said, ‘Do you want to do this?’
He was determined, determined, and indecisive."
However, Graham's vote is to be seen firmly.
"I have made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a terrible charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett totally denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one can confirm what she's called.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizenship Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizenship Day, an annual musical event with a striking list of stars taking part and a message that is equally as impressive: to eradicate poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the main purpose of the 20th annual festival.
The Global Citizenship Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else valuable to help lift.
But how successful has the World Citizenship Day been with just 12 years after reaching their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to want to change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people feel they are making a difference by signing an online petition or sending an e-mail?
Since 2011, the World Citizenship Day says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies amounting to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements that were derived from their actions, with at least $10 billion of them having been classified or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and operators who have committed to "helping children reach their full potential," promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate a shortage of food from the country's 47 countries.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a milestone in history," Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition's 2018 ambassador to the crowd, told a crowd at a press conference.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after more than 5,000 actions have been called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website that asked "what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?"
The World Citizenship Day replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "warchae" to prevent energy exports to Russia - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal with energy as they do in Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to get to grips with this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to give up, to make sure that they do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke greeted the audience at an event being held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy user" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure on and take the place of fuel," he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, taking the place of Russia, the cheapest downside option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" plan of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says makes Berlin a "village" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is only an economic project worth $11 billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's blatant opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure on and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said following a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S. position has prompted a harsh response from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to keep up with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to "Consider a Gail" Applying for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider it hard" to apply for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider applying hard for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been speechless in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before voting."
But a pinch pole that was released on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not stand behind the pinnacle pole of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research Center.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of such an effort.
The pine pole showed much more support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a possible attempt and 48 per cent against.
The other Democratic names that have been boosted as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, lost a year in Iraq after listing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son suffers, what he suffers from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the bruises that some of our soldiers are returning with," he told a rally rally for Donald Trump in Tulho.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other soldiers, "they come back differently, they come back harder and they come back asking if there is any respect for what they have in common on soldiers and planes."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and carrying a weapon in his possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 counties in D.C. support complaints to the New Shelter Police
Eighteen counties and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses plaque to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC introduced a friend-to-be briefing in Washington on Friday supporting a asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his violent sons were members of a gang," had not been treated but U.S. officials refused his request for detention on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Hexham.
He described the revolutionaries of the state that supports Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces many asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants to apply for shelter if they fled domestic violence.
Columbia District State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of federal, state, and international law."
"Federal law requires that any application for a lodge be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," the letter said.
The revolutionaries debated further in the brief under the policy of banning immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and to "provide necessary labor."
Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges should not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"There is shelter available for individuals who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear due to their race, religion, nation, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Shelter wasn't meant to alleviate all the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Lifesaving efforts in Palu as deaths doubled in grace to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"He feels very worried," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforts her sick son at a migration center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute there are ambulances and bodies coming in.
The water is clean."
Residents were seen returning to their homes that had been destroyed, searching through their leftover property, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were completely destroyed.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Harris, who cut his back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where they were treated outdoors due to severe back pain.
Tears came to his eyes as he talked about feeling the earthquake shaken the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
"I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Bullying with ‘Propaganda Notices’
A week after one of China's official new papers ran a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the U.S. promoting U.S.-China trade benefits, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the addition of the China Daily to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular new paper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, accusations China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections was a new step in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to impose trade-promoting announcements, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an escalating trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, experts from the U.S. and China said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now upholding that bill by running propaganda ads in our free press."
"In expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and freedom of the press by placing a notice that they have paid for it in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the new paper stand down this street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find inconsequential voices and you would not see a very good reflection of the diverse ideas that the people of China have about the worrying economic path of China's economy."
He added that "one of China's most prominent new papers has rejected the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are expatriating women who are voting before the midterm elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
As a number of forward-looking Republicans back the nomination to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, especially by women, during the mid-term elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and most of the Democrats on the record are ready to say they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't pull these things back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School at The Hill, said in an article published Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute effort by Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona) to get an investigation from the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior councillor and national spokesperson for the leading group MoveOn, said in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters were shouting "The month of November a man is coming!" as they protested in the Senate's court as the Republicans who run the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be immense," Stu Rothenburg, an undying political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're excited about it; it's true.
But it could increase, especially among unsure women on the outskirts of the cities and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before public testimony from Ford described its allegations of sexual violence against the nomination to the Supreme Court, analyses suggested that it would have a strong response if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has evolved to be a full-fledged slate for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"This is just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they've treated it," Guy Cecil, the group's deputy director of ISA's Priorities, said in a statement.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to coalesce follows the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are confident or opposed to Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are confident or are likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed for sure or are likely to believe that Kavanaugh had told a lie during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford along with at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of depriving her of her sexual organs while at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor is planning to start a new Internet in order to get to grips with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology pioneer project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the Inrupt company's intention was to "rule the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional resources.
It's so that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser and with it at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data repository is that it's up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by means of data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to Company Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help ensure Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer builders.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create decentralized apps themselves using the resources available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are being completely overturned overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help safeguard the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the diversity of the internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm extremely hopeful for this next phase in our history," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the First World War Victory Cross clergyman
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I has been celebrated in his native town 100 years later.
The Reverend Bernard Vanny won an award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a secret shooter four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unearthed by his two uncles during a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his men, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was unearthed exactly 100 years after the race that won the award to his father.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1928, Vice-Chairman Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick cloud and attacks by field forces and machine guns."
He later jumped to the dance line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before rushing to a field alone and accommodating three of the crew.
Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were "something I could never compare to but which undermines someone."
He and his brother, Doctor James Vann, installed a torch after the tour, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the tour" adding that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support that is being given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they found Peppa Pink in its place.
Imagine this, you've stayed on your feet through the night to watch Bellator 206 just to be banned from watching the main show.
The San Jose event included 13 hornets, including a check on the main card and it was shown live through the target in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned as the screen changed to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy with the fact that they stayed on their feet throughout the night especially to watch the ornest.
One Twitter supporter described the change to children's cartoons as "any kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content was not suitable after 6 a.m. so children's programmes had to be changed," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," ie.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will be working on their timetable so that it will include spectators in the UK in the future.
"I'm thinking about the re-demonstration, which we can make him work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to deal with this until it's our time Sunday, their time Monday.
But we are working on it.
I tell you, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they didn't all become friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five hornets instead of six - as usual - we tried to give too much to the fans and it was a long roar.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘extraordinary’ because of his virility
Plumber Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his virility - but that this has prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old swimmer said he hadn't realized until he went to high school "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up "that it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he has expressed his opinion because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American film maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "being unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone goes through so young" he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had lived through highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all-perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there's more to it than winning gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father hadn't accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't say to him, 'You're not going to be around to be in the front row,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and had died did I recognize that it was not insurmountable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at home in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first choice - Proudly by Heather Small - who had rehearsed it before the Olympics and was still skinning his face.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to improve his standard to avoid getting an unfortunate mile stone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the head-and-fours.
Rather than being in the middle of the activity, as has been so common for the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a supporter and working on his gem in the hope of improving the problems he has.
Since the smoothest of riders was not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a good choice for a Le Golf National draw, where the long hardball punishes sprinting shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces right-handed British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with the Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win each of their four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles games, got a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
She had confidence in her husband, although she couldn't do anything else.
"He understood the role he had today, hit my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but then she worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the high spots of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence is an unreliable boost to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sarcastic, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great person to have in the team room," she explained.
"I think the young players are having fun making fun of her, too, this week was nice to see.
It's a lot more than just shaving."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish got their first gem at Valderrama in 1997, where a team was captained by Steve Ballesteros gaining a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the end of the line the advantage down to a hair thickness with Europe winning from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remind yourself that we have a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won only from hair thickness," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday 10th June and 6th yesterday.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the team that this isn't over.
You've got to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the tug, and that's where we'll focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what it's like to stand on the sidelines - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be proud of this.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, you're pretty much being tested as a golfer.
That's the message you need to give to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, apart from Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends in the big victories on the last day, as he is part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Wars at Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gave his players a boost before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medinah.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of emphasis on those games in the middle.
We're putting our line up like this and putting the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has had the task of trying to lead the fight back and he faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I've been with this group of players in this order because I think they'll work well all the way," Bjorn said of his choice for the individual games.
Germany's new warship has been postponed once again.
Germany's new naval fleet should have been commissioned in 2014 to take the place of old Cold War-era warships, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a new paper Die Zeit referring to a spokesman on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Marines in 2014, but problems after its delivery have plagiarized the favour of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Ljungges in 2007 will take the place of the old Bremen class frigates.
According to the rumor, they will include a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles combined and some mystery technologies, such as radar signature, sub-red and lower sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance and maintenance periods - it should be possible to mine the new frigates for up to two years away from their home ports.
But a continued delay means that the pioneering warships - which will allow Germany to throw its power over the sea - will, after the ages by which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
The F125 was in the headlines last year, after the German Lynges refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had been returned to shipbuilders after it had been supplied.
The reasons behind the ship's return were not clear, but German media referred to a number of "essential software and hardware deficiencies" that meant the warship was not good enough if it had to fight.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
It also became apparent that the ship's overweight weight was aggravating its performance and diminishing the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be 7,000 tons twice as expensive as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the poor hardware, the price for the entire project - including the training of the crew - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2billion to start.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming more important ever considering recent warnings that the power of the German navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of ships that can be inspected."
The official said that the problem has worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned without new ships having been provided in their place.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class friars were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is Listening to the Secret Lives of an Insect
A new research work is being carried out on a site in the Highlands of Scotland that seeks to reveal how a migrant uses the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique mothers and that it will help with conservation activities in the future.
The study by Scotland's National Trust scientists will follow the least common stage on the least soprano stage along with a long-range stage and water stage at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the site in order to keep an eye on the activity of the crew throughout the season.
Volunteers and staff of the NHS will also conduct mobile inspections using handheld sensors.
A specialist sound analysis of the recordings will detect the frequency of calls of the band and what species do what.
Then a report and a habitat map will be produced to create a detailed picture of the size of the landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Scotland's National Trust's nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the population and how they are used by all species.
The information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as mine creation and how to manage forests for manure and other related species.
The populations of mudflats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development work that impacts their crops and leads to the loss of habitat.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with insect paper and some chemicals in building materials, and cat attacks.
The squirrels are not blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to see the predators and obstacles that are ahead of them.
Scotland's National Trust owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and they are deeply concerned about the moat.
They have ten trained specialists, who conduct regular inspections, visits to flowers and from time to time savings.
The organisation has established Scotland's first fleet guard at the Threave stop in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eighteen Scottish fleet species.
David Thompson, the manager of the stadium, said that the landscape of the stadium was perfect for them.
"We've got a great area for a crowd here," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good housing.
But there's a lot we don't know about a crowd, so the work we're doing here and on other sites will help us understand more about what they need to be able to thrive."
It emphasizes searching for a moat before doing any maintenance and maintenance work in buildings as it could destroy one maternity ward to kill up to 400 female and young moats, killing all the local population possible.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their belongings. . . .
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Coast Guard Trust, has been urging the public to help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our population and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo ignores accusations of violence as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a newspaper from Germany.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him "fake news," saying people "claim to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to follow the news magazine from Germany's Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus forward has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In, he is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a white Instagram Live video to its 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"Na, na, na, na, na.
What they said today, fake news," said his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," added the player.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called an "unacceptable report of doubts in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral nuisance of the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the crime, which is likely to be one of the most serious crimes in terms of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where he threatened him on a regular basis, according to the papers presented to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 the can" a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one the hundred".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that they have had sex, but that he is consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that photographs were taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of revenge" and was concerned about "letting her be ashamed."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid of United Fans when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer moved to the Italian Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK would regret the loss of car makers forever
The UK would be "forever sorry" if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would stop producing temporary cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said delays at the border could lead to job losses if there was no deal.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain were to fall out of the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini factory in Rhydchen for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what car makers say are risks in the supply chain if there is no agreement on Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and EU for cars being built on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and a shortage of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so the construction would have to end.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "will be carefully designed to avoid those border checks."
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Today on Radio 4.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of achievement chains that have been very successful."
Toyota couldn't say how long the production work would end, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union assembly in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience to once these jobs have gone they are not coming back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting is likely to be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with the vice-president of state Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight over the nomination for Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and impedes the president's possible justice.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy prime minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been like Washington's language for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said it would be "better not to" dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the hearing of the Senedd judiciary committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the girls accused him of sexual misconduct, Drine Blasey.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "No date has been set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being postponed for another week because of all the other things that are happening in the upper house.
But we'll see, and I always like to give the latest information to the press."
Some reporters would suspect that: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the White House for 10 September.
Chris Wallace was asked why.
Sanders said there was no dislike for the "orchestration" of television journalists was the reason for the lack of briefing, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are orchestrating."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that over the past few weeks. This will happen instead of holding a press briefing where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he takes part in open sessions or conferences to the press with visiting figures.
There are only a handful of singles for the press.
In New York this week, the president showed why, in making a flashy appearance and od at times in front of reporters.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish NHS due to concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country wishing them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and decisions are expected to be made in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been pushing for preparations for the possibility of a ‘no deal’ situation.
I know that this time is sure to be an unstable one for all of you.
That's why I want to say once again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Collaborators across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
It's definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christie Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after being hit by a head injury.
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, has had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury as the team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Rees, told reporters that the injury had occurred a half time ago.
"He came to the side line and sort of fell there," Reed said.
Trainees and medical personnel provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before installing it on a stretcher and returning it for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgery at the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is again" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got all five tackles on Saturday before having to leave the game. That brought the total of the season's tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Abroad buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to support the homeless under new plans by the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be given to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that overseas buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to support the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those who earn big wages.
The increase in stamp duty will be given to individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The additional money will encourage the Government's intention to address people who are sleeping out.
The overhead - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-in homes - can be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this offer to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
13 percent of brand-new properties in London are thought to be purchased by residents outside the UK, and this is raising prices and making it difficult for first-time homeschoolers to step up.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the capital - have become "desert towns" because so many buyers from abroad spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up on affordable housing to fix the "quarry of houses" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the conversion of people from their "non-fake" homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said I would engage my work as a prime minister to restore the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means we're going to have to fix our home market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create life here."
However, it can't be right to buy homes just as easily for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies that are located abroad, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from being within their reach, and the bitterness of sleeping out on the street remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ambition in the end is to govern Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ambition in the end" is to be Scotland's team manager.
The 42-year-old is up for the challenge of reviving the North-West club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scotland's Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, Scotland's BBC programme.
"When I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden quite a bit with my father, and it's something that has made me feel like I've never been before.
"It's going to be a great opportunity for me if I'm successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of following such strong names in such a large club, and he has rejected previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"Success for me right now will see 'can I lead this club back to the Higher League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Higher League without, if not without," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy job to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless we could get the club back there."
It's only three years since Ross started his career as a manager, having spent a period as a deputy manager at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in one of Hearts' training staff.
He then helped to raise Alloa after they descended to the third layer, and transformed St Mirren so that they did not descend layer to be at the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably a bit of a cumbersome point," he said as he remembered taking the reins in Alloa.
"I was really convinced that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds cool because I did it right, I made a reasonable living out of it, and I made it to several peaks.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still going through that in terms of the stress and the work pressure but the management feels right.
I've always wanted to be a manager and since I've done that, I'm now feeling more satisfied with my world than ever before."

The perfect time for points is 5.30pm on Saturday night, according to surveys.
The hot weather in the summer has given boost to hard-earning British pubs, but it has put more emphasis on food chains.
Bar groups and advertisers saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but saw a 4.8 percent decline in eating house earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy that collected the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England has stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, there has been a sufficient pattern similar to only June, which was in July, where the 2nd of July, was the hottest.
After the 1.8 percent drop in the grocery store in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Taverns and bars that sold drinks performed best by seeing more of an increase than did homes that ate from loss.
He suffered pubs that focused on selling food because of the sun too, although not as much as people who run houses eating.
It seems like it's just a drink that people want to drink.
Across the taverns and the bars that are managed, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in the sale of drinks for the month, while there was a three per cent reduction in food."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company said: "These results show a continuation in the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events continue to be major factors in terms of sales in the market outside the home.
It's no surprise that eating-home groups are still suffering, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year reduction will be sure to be painful as well as continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for people running food houses that are focused on selling food, and time it seems that a more moderate temperature in August will give some rest that is really needed."
In July, there was a 2.7 percent increase in sales in taverns and dining houses, including some new ones opened. This reflected the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the pub and dining sector in the UK collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups. They have a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and they are the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils showed an increase in "fake insta" pages.
The news has intensified the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty-one of the students said they had a "major" account to show to parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils has shown rapid progress in "fake insta" accounts - referring to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has heightened the concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty-one percent of the pupils said they had a "main" account suitable to show to parents, while they also had a private one.
One mother came across her 13-year-old daughter's hiding place and saw a child in her teens encouraging others to "treat me."
The research work, by Digital Awareness UK and the Pride Teachers' Conference (HMC) independent schools, has found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's worrying that so many children in their teens are being tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletes' table.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Doyle has been elected to be on the Scottish Athletes' Board as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those leading the race to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at an international level over the past decade.
"I have great respect for Ireland across the community of athletes from Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from having it on the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm keen to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the race in Scotland."
The American won the 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his other four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a bout of temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, I got a strike.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I'm going to improve or to what extent I'm going to improve.
It's been a kill but I've improved completely, learned how to walk again and today I'm doing stretching exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is a variety of online opinions about pump advertising that almost compares mothers to cows
A variety of online opinion is the result of an advertisement by a pump company that almost compares mothers who feed cows are being overhauled.
To mark the launch of what is called "the world's first almost silent pump that can be worn first," technical goods company Elvie has released a cellweirus ad in the form of a musical video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers.
There are four real mothers dancing in a woodshell and a cow in it, to a dragon that contains words such as, "Yes, I overtake myself, but you don't see a tail" and "For fear you didn't notice, these aren't beads, but these are beads."
"Pump out, pump out, I'll feed the baby, pump out, pump out, I'll cover the baby."
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been an online burning topic.
With 77,000 people watching the video and hundreds commenting, it has received mixed response from viewers, with some saying it doesn't seriously impart the "excitement" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product."
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie's pump almost fits perfectly and from the look inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mam)
Another said: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for the mother and the baby.
"Why don't you use them to advertise a pump almost to mothers who are going to keep their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't understand the world is from it."
Others defended the ad, and one woman confessed that she saw the song as "overwhelming."
"This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still eating from the chest.
It made me feel just like a cow.
It's a bit boring, but I took it for what it was.
"This is a great book," wrote one
Another said: "This is a fun-filled ad aimed at moms who are pumping (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like a "square."
It's not a good idea to criticize or criticize the advertising industry."
At the end of the video, the group of girls reveals that they have been dancing with the pumpkins hidden in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump from the chest feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits snugly inside the nursing bra. This gives girls the freedom to move, to handle their baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Executive Director of Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product until it deserves a clear and focused launch.
By showing the similarity between breast pumping and cow pumping we wanted to draw attention to pumping the breast and all its challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in an entertaining and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Ellie's pump has reached the front pages.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on stage to designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of mobile children have been moved to a detention centre on the Texas border
The number of mobile children being kept from fleeing has increased abruptly although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because of the strict rule and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to install children with nods.
Traditionally, most donors have been migrants themselves without the right to be in the country, and they have been concerned about jeopardizing their right to stay in the country as they move on to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of donors and other adults in the house would have to provide fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Tolls Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of the same house with sponsors, live in the country illegally, and a large number of those are foreign offenders.
So we're going to continue to go after those individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was usually earlier, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by video-conference call, rather than in person, in order to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for assistance will be sent out of the country without age.
According to shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in detention the more likely they are to feel anxious or low-spirited. This can lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape.
Proponents say that such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the city of tents without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma many are fighting against.
Syria is telling ‘occupied forces’ from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year by now.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, are an excuse to fight against terrorism, and will "handle them properly."
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem called for "the war on terror to be almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than millions deprived of their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleaned up all the territories of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops traversing the country that has been destroyed by war.
Speaking about the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed "three of the countries of the west" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that were encouraging refugees to keep up.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process for them to return," he said.
"They've made it a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the latest important rebel Idlib conflict has created an opportunity to push ahead with political negotiations.
As a result of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it has managed to avoid a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "fixed time limits" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would "get their annihilation."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee, saying the panel's work will be "reviewing the current articles of the composition," and warned them not to interfere.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
That being said, Mr. Trump could be reelected in 2020 unless, as many of the liberals hope, a high-profile conviction and scandal would soon end his presidency.
And that would, without a doubt, be the "most dramatic end to the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the spectators are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak hours viewers, which has increased from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" has overtaken the cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another thesis.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's fun in the middle of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, which can bring families who have immigrated back together, and the state of the global economy.
It's only the most successful viewers who have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes so far as to be an informed citizen when you realize that on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts are debating about the use of the words "thick background" by Bob Woodward as he traces information for his book "Fear," a short skirt of Paul's $15,000.
I wouldn't be able to watch Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's a reality show is that it feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's program characters being circulated and the day-to-day praise in the chorus.
You can't afford to miss one chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's northern shore, but he had swat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senedd Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the background.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs then for a long time and people were saying, 'This is the end of the West's defense,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth about it is that they're right."

Money from outside is flowing to the mid-term election races in the House
It's no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania region is receiving a flow of money, thanks to the redevelopment of congressional regions which means that two detainees are in the race for the same seat.
The recently redesigned Pittsburgh metropolitan region favors Democratic Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another suitor, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th region in Pennsylvania, which is quite a bit out of touch with the new 17th region.
The maps were re-imagined after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old regions were unfairly unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th region has sparked a campaign finance battle between the funding strands of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a competition that received much attention in March in a special election to the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
The Democrats say the Democrats are in the lead.
U.D. Decides to Punish El Salvador for Giving Support to China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, without much unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a guest in Panama until partners turned the management team of the Trump Foundation out.
State Department officials decided to call back heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to refuse to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
El Salvador, which received around $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, which included drug management, economic aid and development, was fined but considered against.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country in Central America and its high rate of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic prosperity to attend a similar meeting which was held last year and which was considered to be a step-by-step approach.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials have explained that they want the conference to go ahead, and thus put an end to any consideration to punish El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been invited to congratulate the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the ministry attaches to the meeting.
And the three envoys from America silently returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new difficult messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to talk about the internal discussions on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the ministry who also spoke on the condition that it was unknown.

The next major event may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility that Mr. Trump has stalled justice, where substantial evidence is now in public records.
According to all accounts, Mr. Mueller also discusses in his report whether Mr. Trump's campaign plotted with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, and he will prepare to go before voters once again, and perhaps a judge of his peers in the long and late hours.
There is a lot of uncertainty about that, and I don't suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - or his peers in Europe.
Each of us needs to make choices on both sides of the East that will have an impact throughout the effort.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, although the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the years of accomplishment that has been.
A course of history revolves around such formative points, and the unfathomable journey of democracy is accelerated or curtailed.
Americans are now facing a lot of these formative points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the Deputy National Day of Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has never been in deep waters since this paper reported last year, he has suggested secretly recording the president and hypothesizing that he is unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the investigation that the FBI has just asked of Brett Kavanaugh is not fully or fairly - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
In any case, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was saluted to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was at once occupying my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the lights of the Sabbath on the table that the swastika would show.
And that's part of my legacy, how can I not be hopeful for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is a believer before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, following the equaliser in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means that they are in a good position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
The injury to his knee meant that Graham Dorrans could not play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
We started the game thinking that we could get something that we came from there with a point.
Maybe we could have beaten in the end but, in general, the match was a fairly equal result rather than likely.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As for Thursday night, it's another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there's a nice feeling in the place now.
The garland is good and the boys enjoy it terribly; the exercises are good.
I hope we can keep going now, forgetting about the last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, only a few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in a Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about a long-term care cost.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking the steps to get that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't let them know about your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you think about a way to pay for those costs as well.
Your choices in terms of long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-for-money life insurance policy to pay for those costs, or self-administering with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Let's take a look at your legal documents: Preventing legal battles.
Make sure that you have a health care box so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical care to make sure that professionals comply with your wishes for fear that you will not be able to communicate.
Also, you should consider the power of attorney for your financial matters.
You would choose a person you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are able to do so.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about allergies and allergies?
Write these details in a written plan so that you're ready.
It's about more than financial matters, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What's the medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Let's make that plan."
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walks home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Depth, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place at around 02.30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths likely rising.
With ties broken, rescue officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala earthquake, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake's peak.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to move after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi state, at the end of a shallow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a prefecture that stretches over 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The prefecture, an administrative area under the province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Excavation for nickel is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Fire Circle of the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The collapse of the Pidie Jaya earthquake in Aceh, causing disaster and terror as people are reminded of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
The tsunami was not caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes struck Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists stranded there for a time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, despite reporting domestic violence and refusing the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman confessed to him trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Control Facility and is being held at a $500 unprotected fund, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Pre-Commanders Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of misreporting the crime of domestic violence, and of possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the event.
His love for her was that he had put a punch in her face.
Sarah Pilan was criticized by ex-military groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behavior to PTSD stemming from his time serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Cannons killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have broken down and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing at the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the ultimate punishment for the man who is suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the ultimate punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the man suspected of the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rental truck by Home Depot to attack a bike path along the Western Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and cyclists who were on their way in October.
In order to justify the ultimate punishment, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight individuals "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally," according to the warning of intent to seek the ultimate punishment, which has been suspended.
Both of those courts are able to impose the maximum penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal judge indicted Saipov with a 22-year-old indictment that included eight counts of homicide for fraud, accusations that are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of crime, crime and murder.
Prosecutors said the attack called for "substantial deliberation and planning," describing Saipov's attack as "atrocious, cruel and destructive."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were terrorists of the money laundering.
A decade has passed since New York's Southern Area introduced the ultimate penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the ultimate penalty was given in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were murdered after they were convicted of plotting to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union at the time.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS banner in his room in the hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to seek the ultimate punishment rather than accept the guilt of a life in prison without the possibility of being released only extends the trauma of these events to everyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to seek the full punishment.
As Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to ‘act on the voice of the people’ during a protest at the Dorian conference today.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ from Eurosceptic members - as one of Theresa May’s MPs himself suggested that she should be responsible for talks with the EU.
At the Birmingham tour, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the backbenches, said the UK would ‘go out’ now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reshaping her highly divided ranks is based on Dorians who in favour of Stay join another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep his Chequers scheme in order amid attacks by people who are in favour of Brexit, people who are in favour of Stay and the European Union.
Allies have demanded that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the reluctance - forcing Eurosceptic members and Labour members to choose between her package and ‘normal’.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘throw Chequers’.
He suggested that he should have made Mr Farage a lord and given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If we had been responsible, we would have gone out now,” he said.
AS Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.’
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone disregarded suggestions that the public's opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member for Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is not popular with the public, the Opposition is not going to vote for the scheme, it is unpublished among our party and our active members who walk the streets in order to elect us in the first place.
Don't go ahead with Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ if they wanted to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
"We are acting on the voices of the people of the country who secured a victory for us in terms of Brexit and we will continue to do so until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, people in favour of Staying through Birmingham overreached before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of Tory activists waved banners against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
One of Labour's lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues they got with the party's app as the conference opened.
“Some of the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in their place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for trouble-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
‘It’s a complete farce.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is serious about applying for the post of President.
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators, says she will be "a close look at applying to be president" after November's election.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat has spoken about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a state representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
There's been a lot of speculation that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she met with voters for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
Someone who was present asked if she intended to stand for the president's office.
Warren said it was time for "the girls to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a girl on the top."
Arrested after LSU's Sims were shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man to be seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed at the South University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died immediately as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the top police officers, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was taken into custody at the Baton Rouge East Pole Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot and 6-inch young boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 opponents of the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the order of the team helped him win the lead over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's order would play a big part in the race.
From the post, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two innings and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pit leaving Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went to the lap pit later coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself who saw the Ferrari driver, dissatisfied, leaving the inside free in danger of falling behind after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he continued in his bid to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth spot.
In the end he came to the balls on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight lap, and Raikkonen came to the fourth position.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done great throughout the weekend and he was a gifted man who let me pass.
The team has done a great job of getting one or two," Hamilton said.
That's a good body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally Saturday for rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in North Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "hateful and evil."
The same thing could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on over the last few days in the Senedd, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and evil and lying," he said.
"When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember her answer... you shared the document - "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, over.
I didn't share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't do anything, we didn't do anything," he added, jokingly.
Feinstein received the letter containing details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and was shared early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I did as she had asked."
But the president didn't seem to believe him, and remarked during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you something, his body language was very bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three daughters, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power in any way that is necessary.
You see the hatred, the malice, they don't care who they are hurting, who they have to step on to have power and control," the president said according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well for a loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer regained the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard leveled the score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men lost in this season's Elite League, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time for the teams to meet this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide an equal goal for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the lead in the first break as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reassembled and, once again, Bouchard ensured that they had an equal score with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee on the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of People Can Fly on a Target Airplane Before an Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller is being called a hero after his death ensures that an airplane carrying hundreds of people rise from the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong backlash is still hitting the area and many are stuck in a rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his co-workers had fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his job at the highly-segregated control tower in Palu's airfield, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely take off.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we missed it this morning before the pilot arrived at Palu.
"Hearing the news is heartbreaking," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number is likely to continue to rise because many bodies are still under the scourges and many bodies we haven't reached yet," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters have shattered Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in support and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing from the small supermarkets all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already dire, but it could get a lot worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the movement and transportation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline, which was flying a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, is now saying one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and all the crew have managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a man traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the traveler, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land in the Chuuk Island airfield.
Officials say seven people have been taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six people were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some of the witnesses believed that the plane had passed over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people were able to walk through water to their center to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the plane's crew were upset and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby sights and that they had helped save people by using a windboat to carry people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes that have been registered with PNG in the last two decades but none of them included Air Niugini.
An interviewer has revealed the time of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday presented its case of re-trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the judge how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis and Chambers on the night she died, going against her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was shaking Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my shaking was in Nashville."
Another indiscretion was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defender will begin his arguments to close on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?

They are eager to return to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.

Nancy from New York is pursuing a couple for her resignation following a "wrong" text message
A nanny in New York is pursuing a couple for differentiating against him and dismissing him after she received a text message misrepresented by the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racial, saying that the situation is as if someone is "trying to profit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was disappointed when she saw childcare provider Giselle Maurice black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA," Mrs Plasco-F-F-F-F-F-F wrote in a text message to her husband's husband's husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unfortunate", resigned Ms. Maurice, saying that their old nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was rather waiting for the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is pursuing the couple for compensation because she has been dismissed, and she is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she had been hired to do at the start, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple have criticized the allegations as racial, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they could not trust her after being angry.
"My wife sent something to her that she didn't think she was going to say.
She's not racial.
We are not racial people," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been dissatisfied with, even if that was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think."
Comparing the legal case to "a situation of someone seeking benefits," Plasco said her wife is expecting a baby in two weeks and is in "a very difficult situation."
Are you going to follow someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still going on, it was a long time before the public court judged the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and their rationale.
Paddington's publishers fear readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into someone's shoes who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very exciting to know what we know about Paddington's charitable success."
He said his father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a tiny teddy bear, would have received the thing if his work had been refused, but added that celebrating 60 years since the publication of the books was "like a lot of love."
She said her father was proud of Paddington's success quietly small, describing the bear as a "very important member of the family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington is so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he's considering Paddington's success in that way.
Although his creation and his imagination were the work, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors were working in vain to save her life.
"She didn't call regularly to say that things were very bad, and she wasn't expected to come through," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I've done it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating began to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died a little before that and now everything was closing down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
A long time later Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane side by side with the other passengers - who were unaware of her experience.
"No one knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and my understanding of it.
I knew how much he loved her."
Girls in mourning post cards to stop suicides on a bridge
Two girls who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son is a promising cook and has a hearty smile.
"Everybody remembers his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that that's going to have an effect again."
Ms Davis drew up the cards, "to let people know that there are people who can go to them and talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don't sit in silence - you have to speak."
Ms. Humphreys has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or low or anything like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their gifts he didn't make any eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said that his death had been a huge shock to them, but that they had to come through: "He is tearing a hole through my family.
He breaks us into pieces.
But we all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the pipeline as the FBI begins investigating
"I thought, if we could get something like he was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, a limited investigation in terms of scope - maybe we could get some unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was apprehensive that the culprit was "fearful."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their timeliness is related to timeliness.
Only five weeks to go until the mid-term elections, on 6 November - if the Republicans are expected to do badly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senedd, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senedd, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s refugee numbers ‘disappear’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Jim Jong-un came into force seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's Unified Administration, said there were 1,127 cases of escape last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stronger processes to manage the borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers are raising are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the people who are fleeing from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country that is easier to cross than the highly protected Military Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who are fleeing as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and it often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization talks that had come to a halt.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a fresh discussion about working towards the elimination of a nuclear power plant in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho slammed U.S. sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not be deprived of our first unequal treatment at all," Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "absolute," saying he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "absolute" by saying he was not fit, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her 'absolute'," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally refuting the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and teasing at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that the allegations against him "destroyed his good name in a coherent and opposing manner" and that it was arranged by libertarians who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's evidence proves he can't serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence shows he's biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows he's inappropriate with those statements and the way Clinton supporters and the Democrats accused him," he said.
Pelosi was asked if she would seek to be confirmed, and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court or be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said as a Democrat she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh cases against the Roadside Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his affirmative hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether it would reverse the Supreme Court's specific decisions.
"This is not the time to have an unreasonable and prejudiced person in court waiting for us to say, 'Is that a great time?'"
The girls need to talk about it.
It is a righteous conversation, months and years of desolation are piled up, and cannot be removed without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
He went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique and so, when she's angry and starts crying, I'm not going to tell the person who's crying," she said.
I'm sick."
And then I'll carry on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger in part because they are, in principle, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were in it the most, and I was crying with anger beyond words, is an older woman grabbing in me the paths of my neck - a cold-blooded stewardess who was always ready to rise from anger.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're being rude.
They think you're sad and they're glad they've hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, said she worked with Gary Hart on her presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in love outside of a marriage to a couple named Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized there was no reason she shouldn't think about applying for the position herself.
"I didn't think about the decision right," he told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race ready, and the last thing he needed was another.
One of them called us "Snow White and the Seven Corners."
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her in terms of raising money, so she vowed she wouldn't take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
She noted that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too far for her - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voters' sympathies, rather than the votes of those who voted against her.
"You'd think my nerves were broken," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my bodyguard.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be in favor of Beijing
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war were enough to defraud someone, and while the fight isn't over, a gap between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of items, taxing, for all purposes, half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid back every time and, most recently, it has imposed tariffs from five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match U.S. efforts and the world's largest economy is only one likely to resign soon.
Having Washington to give up on her means renouncing the demands, but publicly suggesting that the U.S. raises too much shame on Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say if Beijing can get around it right, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies are less dependent on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that are starting economic panic in both the country and its other, in fact, is much more dangerous than what viewers have previously recognized as an Asian phenomenon," said Abigail in a statement.
Syria 'ready' to receive asylum seekers back, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is willing to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and appeals for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions are improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to rehabilitate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The conditions are now right for asylum seekers to return to the country after having to flee from terrorism and the harmful economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There is a need for humanitarian assistance for six million people still living in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive support with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the team of Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 required point to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had had a difficult tournament, but when the U.S. star landed the ball in the water on the 16th par-3 hole he had to give up the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had starred in every round, becoming 1 of the 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top scorer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who was most likely to play in his last Ryder Cup.
And he played in his eighth Ryder Cup, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
She's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for my change and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm proud to have been able to help," Garcia said through his tears after winning Europe.
He handed the baton to fellow U.S. golfer John Ram and beat U.S. golfer Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the game to the singles on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old boy.
Woods lost each of his four games in France, meaning his record now in the Ryder Cup was 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistic for one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, the U.S. team had struggled over the weekend to find the clear way.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they'll fight hard.
We had a lot of pressure on Europe in the morning.
We've been fighting.
You've got to pay tribute to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
Each of his 12 players played very well in the game.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move forward.
"I love our 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your head to them.
"They've played better than us."
