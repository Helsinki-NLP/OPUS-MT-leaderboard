Welsh Assembly members fear they will “look like the Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could be ridiculed.
One member of the Labour Party said his group fears that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member for Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group is approaching the change of the name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP has close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where the option to call the Welsh Parliament Assembly was widely supported.
As for the title of Assembly members, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support in public discussion.
Members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may cause concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the context of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
An in-between vote is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that changing the name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced as churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The old people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing there today."
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are meeting in a different way today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer living quarters where people go regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people who will not help the rest of the shrines in the neighborhood much.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation relocated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation, whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bell ringer “the bells of the poor.”
The tradesman, who played the bell game in July, called it another way: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell-tower in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell-tower in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders has taken place at St. Martin, some of whom have been summoned by lay representatives of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the leading body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese in which he expressed his concerns that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the council of elders, although the hiring of architects and builders that the diocese sent to the diocese was not the case.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who dives for lobsters in California
According to an official report, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobsters in California on the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first considered the call to be a joy to catch a lobster, but then “he realized he was shouting ‘Fuck me!
Bite me!’”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had a torn whole area of the keybone."
“I screamed out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area for several weeks, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to build the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetics lanes in the style of a department store, where specialized retailers will be available.
As the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market continues to grow and sales of fashion and household goods continue to decline, cosmetics streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and expanded to other stores next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find use for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space thanks to branded locations similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique make-up range, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the concessions of perfume retailer Fragrance Shop, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south London, and another one this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the internet and moving towards everyday shopping for a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like commercial homes as a chain of supermarkets strive to fight discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl with a better service offering and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of Argos stores and also established a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago, increasing food sales and making the acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to remake the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
In the early millennia, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds plans to play its role by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s business director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the look and style of the streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and the attractive environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is ‘enraged’ after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Dragons Day star Peter Jones is "soaring" after television host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homemade clothing and accessories Truly.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old moderator of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Dragons Day star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was "frustrated" when a television star admitted at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to the new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their homewear brand.
The company was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby at an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones left the UK for one of his summer resorts.
The source said: “The Truly badge was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all those involved was absolutely shocking.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning’s moderator, who is among the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a bold investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home apparel and a possible further delay in launching the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and two-and-a-half-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Anta McPartlin for moderating I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he gets from journalists as a remark that some consider "unworthy of the president" and how he speaks positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded with his mocking “voter” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump praised it as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in further meetings.
But the nuclear-weapon deal is stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "appropriate response" from the US to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, have yielded positive results – ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remains of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people from outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been expelled from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," says Ms Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization puts together a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations will be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still unprepared for Mother Nature’s anger.
Although shelters were built in Aceh against the tsunami, this is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Paul from the tsunami, even though the warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Even at the best of times, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is suffering from funding shortages.
President Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority embrace a more conservative form of faith.
The street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people and has driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He tossed the ball to the left and shot at the distant bar.
The shot flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the jumping Kepu Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far in advance as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant approach me, so I didn't think much about it, and he fired a single shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 to the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the pass back to Mate Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the pitch and sprinted halfway to Liverpool.
Kovacic hit the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down Hazard's beautiful alley into the lime.
He ran away from the defense and ended up with a left-handed bar next to Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
On Wednesday at 15:00 Liverpool will meet the local team in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
As reported by the Indonesian disaster authority on Sunday morning, the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami surged to 832.
A 7.5-magnitude quake struck Friday, triggering waves up to 6 meters high and imprisoning many people in the debris of collapsed buildings, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho office said at a news conference.
The city of Paulu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who were moving near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras might have recorded something, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation," he said.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who thought they knew the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation was underway and are now informing the relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed into or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The residents have now learned that it will take a few hours for them to be able to return home.
A police officer told one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape and another was waiting outside.
In the closed area, there are a number of policemen who are monitoring the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in parliament has recently become a hit due to a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the targets would be Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th century view and part of the character’s historiography that many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people today consider Cromwell, although slightly less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure representing one side of this division.
His successes in the role of Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Pig Killer Cracks Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery in a blood clot near a snout at a market in Liou-pchan-shui in Kuej-chou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in the piglet on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Ching-chai.
He arrived with a cousin from the outskirts of Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side hatch was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the snout with a muzzle of blood.
According to the forensic investigation, it was confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig of the farmer had torn.
"The nephew's legs were all bloody and torn," the Guiyang Evening News newspaper quoted a cousin as saying by the surname "Wu."
The security footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so that no one else would think of it when the police at the scene collected evidence.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family to compensate for his death.
Swine attacks on humans are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and a man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kg had driven a Welsh farmer to a tractor and was driven away by a farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move above the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, flooding will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure barrage forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with an approaching low-pressure barrage, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rainfall of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, flooding can occur.
Given the danger of tropical rains, it would be very unreasonable to go on foot to the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring local impact winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure barrage will bring heavy local precipitation to some parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller currents of debris and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, isolated tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays the rains spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes throughout the US as the Arctic begins to cool, but the tropical zone will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sudden temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the U.S. center on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to expand the dominating summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the U.S., a warm start to October is expected with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to part of the northeast of the U.S.
In New York City, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation was watched by more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday’s captivating statements by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and voters interrupted mainstream programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was touching her drunk at a high school party and trying to strip her of her clothes.
Kavanaugh, in his exhilarating statement, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to the Nielsen agency.
The company calculated average follow-up on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast the reports, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in the offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly endorsed Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest following of all stations when it was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second station was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the end of the meeting.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught him screaming at protesters as he was about to take an elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN broadcast live how he stood for a few minutes with his eyes closed and let himself be saddened.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
“Do you think the country is telling the truth?”
He also heard, “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before the elevator doors were closed, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks were later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, as demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicians' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicians" over Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy their tariffs on each other was “absolutely pointless.”
Waydeo Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted after the interrogation that Waydea had been shot.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, State Police Criminal Laboratories, Southern University Police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "push and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death "shaked" the team and "shocked" him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
A volcano hurls ashes at Mexico City
The ashes, rolling from the Popacatépetl volcano, hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of tumults and tremors.
Images of windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash have appeared on social networks in some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters for independence clashed with law enforcement and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Ordinary police officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them. The ones on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also clashes, for which the police had to use earrings to calm down.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the protesting supporters of the Union, who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters were overwhelmingly in favour of independence, but participation in the elections was low because opponents of the breakup boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to end voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-five-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for independence for Catalonia.
“We had some of the best moments last year.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we're in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, although the imminent victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went into exile themselves, or they are awaiting a trial in detention.
Fourteen-year-old Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of police on his phone, saying the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men jailed after car crash into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry by car.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone may have shot the car.
Meng's hit secured Livingston's 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who stepped down from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership this season and next Sunday will face the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended a series of non-defeat division games to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston didn't take the chance against inconspicuous guests
Holt's team had to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped just past Craig Halkett's header in front of the gate.
The home team just had to watch the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that guests could be tormented by standard situations.
Then came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston created a bowl, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sending Menga, who had flown and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly usually didn't have much work to do.
The same image of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's legs were stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not hit from another standard Livingston situation.
In the penalty area of Livingston, the centers were constantly flying, which players were constantly cleaning up, and in vain came two penalty kicks – after Halkett’s attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another in hand.
"The Phenomenon" of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for how the team has exploded since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-arranged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby for the entire time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their end was weak – they only penetrated the home side once – and for the Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the visitor’s controversy, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in London after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with the bustling Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived early, but the man was dead at the scene.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver fled the scene.
Metropolitan police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six guards injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the riots in a high-security male prison.
The riots erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To cope with the upheavals involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialized guards from the “Tornado” team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specifically trained prison personnel have been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six of the staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended after the attack on the prisoner in the hospital.
And in October last year, law enforcement units were called to the prison for serious riots in which personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (areas where drought can benefit)
It’s not unusual for Arizona to be hit by a low-pressure tropical storm, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or pressure lower status within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosy can be a blessing because the area has been affected by drought.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these precipitations may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s population is experiencing at least “extreme drought,” the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still on the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, posing a high risk of flooding.
“In the region from Baja California to northwest Sonora, total precipitation is expected to be 75 to 150 mm, with a potential for up to 250 mm,” the weather.com server said.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives on Tuesday morning at the Arizona border, then passes through Arizona and enters southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk for Rosy or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly torrential flooding and debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a cell phone record of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Had Experienced the Wickedness and Anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, resolutely and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford was also present at the hearing on the charges.
The president said on Saturday that on that day “Americans witnessed Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service on his account.”
The president indirectly hinted at Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans participating in midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A top Republican adviser told CNN the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected on the floor of the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds and death toll continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, but at dusk, up to six-metre waves hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami wave was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and did not immediately escape, so they fell victim to the waves," a spokesman for BNPB's Indonesian disaster mitigation agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go alone, it took cars, sheds, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences also shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful quakes was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could have increased the tsunami wave even more.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found enchanted under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "completely mutilated without any information" from Donggaly.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are targeting the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not inform Palu that a tsunami wave had struck, although authorities said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard screaming desperately to warn people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast will be hit by a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city has been reopened only for transportation assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff from Donggaly arrived in the city of Paulu, where employees were hiding in shelters from the customs built in the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed homes," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the relief groups began their sad disaster relief efforts, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can start flowing to the site of the disaster only after the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” says Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
On the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Paul, the friends and relatives of those who are still unknown still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the wreckage next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon described how in the hours that followed, after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu contestants who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue markings, his messages ended with a gray mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves took $26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport Police Department press release, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money into it.
When he did, another man “runned out of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “The entity formally known as Kanye West.”
Forty-four-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator said.
West has previously said that the word for him has religious significance in addition to the abbreviation of the existing professional name.
"In my opinion, 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he spoke to Big Boy, the radio host, about his album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanya, which means the one, to mere Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Many other famous rappers have also changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with and without the conjugator and in uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexico’s AMLO president vows not to use military against civilians
On the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people on October 2, 1968, for peaceful demonstrations in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of opportunities for education are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
According to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced a plan last year that aims to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in the Othello game, and later was a senior researcher at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robot Call, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“Academic leaders are not driven by China, but by corporations,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring the best experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the field of AI.
“In my opinion, AI PhD holders should automatically be offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other governmental organizations donate money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, which is why it vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters would come in to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough MEPs have said they will be guided by the result of the vote.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally cast their votes.
“I went to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko hand over their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would pave the way for the country to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and pulling chairs out of tents built by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads raised, not the door to the service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
The result, he said, would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could be attended by between 30 and 43 percent of voters - less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its inception in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City came for the goal throughout the defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a touchdown that the Argentine striker got in the middle of the field.
He advanced between the three Brighton defenders and made his way into the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green shirts.
On the outskirts of the fine territory of Brighton, one defender bypassed and several others ran ahead.
The next round to the left, he found Sterling.
The English striker hit the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who right-handedly beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote bar.
The Sky Blues striker shoved the ball into the net just before slipping off the pitch.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were expelled from the playoffs, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But the perpetually competitive Scherzer hopes to take the lead Sunday in a game against the Colorado Rockies – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have hopes of a playoff.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card win 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least play for ourselves because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with probably the greatest effort that I’m going to have this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly leaning towards pitching Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start, and he would train and pitch on Thursday, when he usually has a day off.
Washington’s right-handed striker has 18-7 statistics this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia.
The president spoke indirectly about the situation around his Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nominee when he spoke about the importance of Republicans participating in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
In one of the most important elections of our lives, there are five weeks left.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t run, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any necessary means, you see the wickedness, the disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats have opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you see that in the last four days," he added, saying that Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud buzzing of the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring out the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists from Momento in my local party voted for my warning, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely expressed their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party’s meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings are not taking place today, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, who I thought we had similar political views before, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and take positions that I would not otherwise agree with – whether it was the EU’s national security or one.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then there’s a tidal wave on social media calling for my appeal, condemning the politics of the centre, and telling me I shouldn’t be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face an influx of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed in is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse stream of opinion and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I have been advised many times to hold back, not to say so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which literally caused my general school class to fall apart, I have strived to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or a minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised at my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country breaks into Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not for the moment in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of revocation or political pragmatism will prevent me from acting in accordance with all that I believe is best for you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining match at Tennent’s Premiership.
Now they're at the top of the table as the only losers.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chances, which helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through big tests in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, “All the honors of Ayra, they took chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot won the unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty and then scored exactly in half time and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on the reels, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to five Stafford McDowalll, which he transformed by Climo.
Deputy captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the player in addition thanks to the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clim without a ball, MacPherson from the penalty shootout laid the ball behind the advancing maul Ayra.
Climo changed, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five home runs.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The fifty-six-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he plays with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
A blue flag in the color of the ocean is flying over public buildings.
The naval bases off Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to obtain it.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline that the country lost to Chile in a bloody war over resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
These desires are perhaps the biggest in decades as Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiation.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision of the MSD on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate that Bolivia will provide a sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic native President Evo Morales – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – is also keen on Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not change.
The U.N. body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to attribute Chilean territory to anyone and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the MSD comes just six months after the last arguments were heard shows that the case “was not complex,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps rather slowed it down.
"The issues of access to the sea have been addressed by the current Bolivian government," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
He adds that Morales’ attacking rhetoric has weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will one day start to act again, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – would use the question of the sea as a political bait.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judgement is an opportunity to find that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he’s “planned hope” that ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headgear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of shivering huge headgear for their Spring/Summer 2019 collections at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
Valentino’s showpiece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide feather-like rim that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were decorated with melons, a witch's hat, and even pineapple - but they are not meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks have their lips sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled a diving gear with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cornucopia with reddish ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you are in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could also arrive in fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after La Bomba, a half-meter-wide straw that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media has sent another huge creation to the show piers – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuits that wears it.
A dark orange raffia bag with raffia straps and white leather handles was a piece of the spring/summer 2019 La Riviera collection by Jacquemuse at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have achieved a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individualized school curriculums, we observe that modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s tests show that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest success rates being achieved by independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of Mandarin students, 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students achieved the highest A mark.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by pupils are equally valued in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons that employers cite as problems in filling vacancies, 17% are under-skilled.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you learn a second language, you will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, being frank.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have at independent schools a choice of several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what awaits them in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are vitally important for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and attraction.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut in the Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will be looking forward to it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes it will take.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump's Speech in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the vote to confirm his vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s performance start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh hearing that took place this week and was very tense on charges of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans pick up pace ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organizers say the five meetings next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority that they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh media could be watching" at a rally in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Its Stomach Is Fighting to Keep Hope from Sunday Singles
After three one-sided games, the Saturday pairing could be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the shuttle going now?
"They were six points and now it's four, so we're taking it so the shuttle is probably moving a little towards us," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel like they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly as he moved from the field to the green, and he sets an example.
Celebrity shouts further intensified the continuation of his lap, as he managed a key kick to win the entire match when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole match, encountered a similar yell that tells you the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Weird, but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way the energy flows both towards the tumultuous audience and from him confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday victory, and that in the sunset over Le Golf Naitional there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Better both at the same time to a different hole.
However, the talk of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when paired with Alex Noren.
The pit and two ducks on the front nine buried the Spaniards and Swedes in the abyss from which they had not climbed.
No one will be able to help you on Sunday.
Two-to-two ball games are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this two-pair game has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for fighting that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
Europe leads Ryder Cup final day with 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage by the last day of the Ryder Cup after the two-ball games on Saturday came out with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning games on two balls with the American side, which failed in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into a deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who have been dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four inaugural games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then smoothly beat the tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in a doubles game on two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning two-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the 2&1 doubles defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – world number one and three.
Europe, however, did not win the whole line on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time top scorer Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the two-ball game and returned later to defeat the pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the two-ball game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-game draw, although as a defending side, Furyk only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, Sunday counterattack seems to be behind them.
North Korea says it will not disarm "in any way" unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continuing UN sanctions had deepened their distrust of the United States and the country would never give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see an adequate response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step in the process, his statement appeared significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization in tymong just because Pyotr Kim was a pro-denuclearizer.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to enforce its targets, and even opposes ‘declaration of end of war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were on the side of denuclearization and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.”
However, Rih’s tone of speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of missiles on U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump branded Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea fully denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame, saying: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue swiftly and unabated until we realize complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made only to be declared by North Korea within hours that he was raising "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hopes for are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that is meant to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all of its students sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studios all night long when students don’t sleep and encourage caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the foundations of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a women's hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were really sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of student colleges where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another part, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is also growing.
Enough good quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid catching up, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into starvation mode, so a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
It hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting an alarm on when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a further loss when Dolly Menga's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side tried to record their first win from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only a second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts leaders.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed uninspired and unwilling to settle.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third and right behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there could be further problems with the Rangers after line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which swept Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who last week picked up the Hearts point and would be delighted as his well-trained team strangled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when they clashed with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson kicked the Colombia challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the finish line in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibala's header and the soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs’ deep set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and managed Meng for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate effect when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of exactly the kind they liked when Lithgow and Halkett hit one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor was well positioned to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another delayed penalty claim when he got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and it is still increasing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter became a constant of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it's really cracking!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivet is re-injected
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells, had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them into a laboratory, so they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be reapplied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when immune cells were removed from patients and “taught” to focus on cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia type.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, wearing his magic hat, after his performance on the SNL.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was featured in Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he began spitting on Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I wouldn’t be in America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of raping Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had eaten up his headdress in the backstage.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that cap."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his superman suit because it means you can’t say what to do.”
Try love."
His comments only earned the crowd’s buzz at least twice, and SNL members looked embarrassed, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, “The whole studio is completely silent.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confuses many by singing the song "I Love" disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous characters: THANK YOU FOR putting up the crowd."
But visiting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was just who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe he represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
The 31-year-old actor, however, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said such on-screen roles often mean that young boys feel they must be tough to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed “something is wrong” and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is "quite strongly" expressing this problem.
"At this point, I personally feel, quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What are we teaching a teenage man about the problem we’re seeing here now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, growing in them the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a page?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how to change it?
Because young men must have changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series was completed, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November onwards, Kit will play in Sam Shepard’s restored True West, which is the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with his current wife Rose was for the best that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife while filming the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love for Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected by this virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread throughout some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these intercourses.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking GOP senators’ data, bends the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wikis.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the charges were backed by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included addresses of homes and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was made public by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of the posts, is linked to the Waters office and has published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely untrue and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is an absolutely untrue and absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is annoying," Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be angry.
He must not be rebellious.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
You have to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who ran against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “competent authorities and authorities active in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire on how obviously bad a nation we are be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this cuddly, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber-faced face had his license to rewrite that stuff in a whole new way – that name more than anything else signaling that it is a wide-ranging comic work intended for non-English-speaking cinematographic audiences.
He is of course the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big cocksucker of the guy who captured the only tone in Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television commercials Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this last edition of JE there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the blades of the rotor briefly tingled about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but humor feels rather under-dimensioned and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is meant for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of an agent in service - too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and passionate character already suffering from the total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the character of Theresa May as best she can, but in the script there’s nothing much.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy of hers is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time teaches a record-breaking lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering ex-partner Bough, who was played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the submarine commander, an afflicted character to whom Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, packing for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of freckled pathalia: disguised as waiters, they ignite a French restaurant; create chaos as they smuggle Volt's luxury yachts aboard; and English launches pure anarchy as he tries to get to know the interior using virtual reality.
All the aces are definitely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how self-indulgent and turbulent it is, it has something from children's television in it.
Quite a moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour denies that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is considering a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The party reportedly wants companies to hand over savings to workers that result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but they would still receive the same reward.
The sources claim that this idea would “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has been approved by Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party’s attitudes to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
This aspiration, however, is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was committed to returning energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall share, as the Labour government could carry out “collision” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and create equity funds that will transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could have changed their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the latest vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the office’s findings could sway some Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In a Sunday "60 Minutes" interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's decision, however, is unshakable.
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would be a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the ones she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by the age of 20.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To be able to get a free ticket to an event (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing the world leader, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, they will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the hedged funds still have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and we fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars at this year’s New York City premiere, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for ‘blockade’ to prevent Russian energy exports
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed that he can “refer to the Navy if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy is not directed to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is seen in the US as "the voice of the energy consumer".
He compared Washington’s approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to invest in or replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-stop” player with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russian, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “handy” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “take a close look” at 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would "closely look closely" at the candidacy for president.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
“After November 6, I will be looking closely at the presidential candidacy.”
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said she shouldn’t run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be related to other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "someone else is coming back, they are coming back together, they are coming back, and they are asking if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, give to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and holding a gun intoxicated, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department, said.
18 States, D.C. Supports Call for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new measures by the U.S. government to curb asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and a district in Washington, D.C., issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing ubiquitous gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the U.S. Immigration Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignored decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," he said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny entry to immigrants harmed the U.S. economy and said they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence as early as June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems—even all the serious problems—that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the number of victims has already doubled, race to find survivors over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her fevered boy at an evacuation center in the dry city of Palu.
“An ambulance will bring in more bodies every minute.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking themselves up through stuffed things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he painted the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared the room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was dragged into the ruin of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
US Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Hacking’ Propaganda Ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper devoted to the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the China Daily surcharge paid in the Des Moines Register - the state's largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newsstand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the dissenting views that the Chinese might have on China’s troubling economic path, given that the media belongs to the “Chinese Communist” company.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has refused to make an offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Voters Before Elections Over Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend a candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several accusations of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections they will recognize a response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high and most Republicans on record already say they want to continue voting.
These things can't be brought back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute seeking an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, not even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told a newspaper in D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” at a rally in the Senate Hall, where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was high already, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not go to elections.
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed it could be followed by opposition.
“There was a messy mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not about whether Kavanaugh sits on the chair, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a bit more sympathy for the other named.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and ahead of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of this startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal authorization through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to John Bruce, CEO, to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the employees working on the project, collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in his media post published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the site,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victorian Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place a hundred years since the only clergyman of the Anglican Church received the Victorian Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “geniusly symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victorious act.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He later made it to the front line and with "the utmost courage" led the line forward before throwing himself into the firing range and knocking three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with their brother Dr. James Vann, they laid the wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt a great honor to be able to participate in the show,” adding that “the bravery of a true hero is manifested by the support provided by a lot of people.”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead getting a pig named Peppa
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the naughty Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The bill from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasting took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were stunned when the news turned into a show about the pig Peppa.
Some remained undisturbed after waking up until early in the morning for the match.
One Twitter fan described the change to the children’s show as “a form of bad joke.”
“According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so it is necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications after being asked about this broadcast.
"Pep's bitch, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the programme to engage audiences in the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when that program changed, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you it won't happen again next time.
We’ve reduced it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried with all our strength to keep the promise given to the fans and we haven’t succeeded.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels inferior' due to sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to go for success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that due to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a crossbowman in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him at the same time, because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and other things were real things that gave me the strength and the power to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out what it was like with his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT rights fighter and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “hit the unprepared.”
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said he had "changed the whole angle of view."
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been like, ‘I want a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t agree with dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the lead.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed of it my whole life - jumping in front of our home team at the Olympics, I don't know a better feeling," he said.
This also inspired a selection of his first song – The Stream by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and continued to evoke goosebumps in it.
The Desert Island Discs show airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson would hit a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup match, but would have to fine-tune his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years for a record twelve, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's fourballs and foursomes to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on the game in a row he hoped would fix what troubled him.
This 48-year-old has never been the most direct of the drivers, not even at the height of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where the long cleft terrain routinely punishes stray bullets.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson faces the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth Sunday match, who has won all four of his matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped a quick start, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband and added nothing else.
“He totally understands the role he played today, slapped me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"They believe so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall and in the past and this week he has been so beneficial to these teams.
I couldn't imagine he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record in most of the Western Ryder Cup held on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence on the team has brought some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun of going after him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that great leadership heading into the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the finish line with a close victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You have to keep in mind that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only tightly,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 season, when they won 5-3 on Friday and 6th of last night.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it's not behind us.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to get the trophy and that is what we are focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players behaved on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have managed it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances are being prepared and that is too difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re there to be on your own, your golfer’s ability is fully tested.
This is a message that you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great upheavals when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, to then end up as a loser when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to go to the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
So we set up a line-up and made sure the boys feel like you know, like we're going to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of boys in that order because I think it covers the whole trip,” Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship rescheduled
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snowy coastlines, local media reported.
The commissioning of the flagship Rheinland-Pfalz, an all-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the challenging post-delivery issues have hampered the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, which the Navy had ordered in 2007, will be used.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with powerful guns, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
The constant delays mean, however, that top-notch naval vessels — which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas — will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit newspaper notes.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after handing over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of fundamental "software errors and defects in the metal elements" defects that would render the warship unusable in combat deployment.
Software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workforce needed on Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to have a significant excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz ship is believed to be twice as heavy as the class-like ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects on the metal elements, the price of the entire project is also a problem – including training of the crew.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price rose to a dizzying 3.1 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained in importance especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the naval army is indeed "coming ships capable of deployment."
This representative stated that the problems were continuously packed because the old ships were decommissioned but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to become part of the naval equipment.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
In the Scottish Highlands, a new research is underway to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities for the conservation of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland Association, will track fleas, the smallest and brown, long-legged and aquatic, in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this bat habitat, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the year.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what each species does.
A habitat map and a report will then be issued to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s natural resource conservation adviser, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and best practices in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations of Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have been declining to a great extent in the last century.
They are endangered as a result of construction and territorial development, which affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks, can also pose a risk.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting for prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, colony inspections and sometimes also rescue work.
The organization even set up the first and only dedicated bat reservation at the Threave settlement in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
Residential manager David Thompson says that this is the ideal area for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work on real estate, because it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hands to the work and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges and His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to be visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, which reported on the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly subsequently paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live video on Instagram, calling it “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to live on in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel on unfounded charges that they called "unacceptable notifications of suspicion in the private sector."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount of the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent times."
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and at a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the gambling den, where, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was allegedly anal raped.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was at "99 percent" of the "house" and disappointed at "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking a resumption of proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was accused of taking a step back from Manchester United's move to Real Madrid and was bought by Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million this summer.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, company secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"An agreement is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
At the plant in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured, Toyota produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a “just in time” basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being delivered for custom-made cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption, which the sector says could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU are “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only current success, but also seizing this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the trade unions at the plant, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places disappear, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred another week” as the fight for the post of Chief Justice continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council, which investigates interference in Russian elections, ties between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump is firing a deputy general, threatening Mueller’s independence, Washington’s chatter has been fed up with it for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he arrived at the White House on Monday, surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would not "prefer" Rosenstein's release, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid colluding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's indictment, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “No date has been set yet, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move the next week in view of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’ll always share up-to-date information with the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were not due to aversions to the “theatre” of television reporters, even though she said, “I don’t agree with the fact that they’re going to perform.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she added, without providing evidence. "We've looked at those numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talks with me.
We’re trying it, and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing it for the last few weeks, and that there’s going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to settle the costs of requests for the status of EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on distance are continuing, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities we provide services to.
“Scotland is absolutely your home and our sincere wish is for you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Exiled Tennessee Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has postponed emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat by rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and health professionals put oxygen on Abercrombie’s sidelines and then placed him on stretchers and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had postponed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type/range of the injury" are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in the red T-shirt, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move aimed at attracting young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
It is expected to increase the state treasury by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy a property in the UK, with the money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property tax will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the money also boosting the government’s efforts to fight sleep without a roof over their heads.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax on purchases, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say the newly built property in London is purchased by 13 percent of non-UK residents, pushing prices out of the way and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get home.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “towns of ghosts” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policies emerged just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on real estate purchases to help more young people move to their own first home.
He blamed the big construction companies for keeping real estate prices high by taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix the "household inconvenience" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a string of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of “inviolable” removals.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I said last year that I want to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that every new generation has a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hard-working residents of the UK.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their head is too real.”
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of rebuilding the Northeastern club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got grade B and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and it’s always something that draws me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in leading the club."
Ross's predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a large club when he previously rejected pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would be measured for me at the time by the question of whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I would probably feel successful if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, previously serving as assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent into the third group and transformed St Mirren from a starting decline to a champions title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever had in his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably real crossroads," he recalls when he took Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds strange because I was good, I made a good profit, and I enjoyed a decent height.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my entire adult life right now.”

Research has found that a great time to pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the incomes of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when pub traffic increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more crowded.
The decline in restaurant revenues by 1.8 percent in June worsened further in July.
So far, pubs and bars with a taste for drinks have behaved most strongly in the same way that restaurants have made them worse.
The taverns, whose main sales are from food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for a given month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although an annual drop in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer can’t be a worse time for food-loving business operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much needed relief.”
Overall sales growth in taverns and restaurants, including newly opened ones, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentations.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, an industry-leading benchmark in the industry.

Research Among 20,000 High School Students Shows Rise in ‘Fake Instagram Pages’
Reports have heightened concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a “main” account that parents know about
One in five children — at the age of 11 — create social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” that they share photos of.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have an embellished “main” account that parents know about, and at the same time have a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage girl is encouraging others to “rape them.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s troubling that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Voice of Athletes’ in Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those in the leadership of the sport like those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that it will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to recover completely, I've learned to walk again, and I'm able to exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!”
Milk sucker evoking comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of vacuum cleaners shared online opinions with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent wearable vacuum cleaner”, Envi, a consumer technology company, has released a music video exaggerating the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the text: "Yes, I'm touching, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice I don't have a hernia, here are my breasts."
The choir continues, "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I feed my sweet milk."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, provoked a controversial online response.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie vacuum cleaner discreetly puts on breastfeeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Certainly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not abuse them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, “This ad is completely off.”
There were also those who defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she considered the song “infectious.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I were still breastfeeding.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but it's up to the point.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck their milk (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement to praise or damn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet suction cups hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is absolutely silent, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in the breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk while vacuuming.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves a distinctive and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to point out the suction of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will ensure.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's vacuum cleaner has been on display.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and principles put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of threatening the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed that they belonged to the child.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified through Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of accompanying single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of child cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear through video conference calls instead of personally declaring their case as a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to angry outbursts or escape attempts, asylum workers claim and report from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” should withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more lost their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the war-torn country.
When he extradited the refugees, Moual said conditions were good for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that caused the refugees to not want to return.
“We have appealed to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protection zone in the last refuge of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-protected Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who “will be wiped out.”
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee, consisting of members of the government and the opposition, will be held soon to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning of action.
Why Trump Will Win in the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the prosecution and scandals did not prematurely end his office as president.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential term in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the main-broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in mainstream broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased cable TV viewership to 3.5 million watching mainstream night news.
“It’s the heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of Designated Survivor on ABC’s drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and show host of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's funny,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in of Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you watch a six-hour panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar leather ostrich jacket “Dress up” by Mr. Trump.
I’m not going to look at Super Maria the same way again.
“Part of what he does and what makes the reality show feel like he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the N.F.L. Trump rotation, in which he applauds Kim Jong-un.
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleisse this week, it was sunny, out on the north shore of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was creepy inside and watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money flows from the outside into the tightest home races of the medium-term election
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th District is experiencing an influx of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that generated two office holders fighting for the same seat.
This recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburgh by the district Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a fierce financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became well-known in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the March special election to the 18th congressional district.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump in the district won by 20 points.
Politicians are giving the Democrats a slight lead.
U.S. Considers Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China, Resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until partners judicially moved the Trump leadership’s organizing team.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to revoke the U.S. directors of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement issued earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With the ongoing internal negotiations, North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following on from the previous year’s similar negotiations, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials have clarified that they want to continue negotiations and effectively finalize any fines contemplated for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with resolving the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal the administration is putting in place, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on terms of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who has close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of studies
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from a special commission on a possible impediment to Mr. Trump’s enforcement of the law, of which there is now a lot of evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly looking into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
Should there be a party exchange in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to file a plea before this body, as he is preparing to re-appear before the electorate, and in the end, he would probably be awaited by a jury composed of his colleagues.
That’s a whole series of “ifs,” and I don’t want to argue that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice before us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler, it was only enough for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich's Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that ensued.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein had been skeptical since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or what if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite persuasive accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we be voting in mid-term for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will have a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me on Saturday to light candles on a table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that their victory over the Austrians would give them great hope of progress from the Group G European League after an impressive draw in Spain at the Villarreal pitch earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into a fight with the belief that we could pull something off, and we took a point.
Maybe we could have replicated it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we manage to get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last game they played a good result. However, with the spectators behind me I am sure that we can push and it will work out well.
"Last year was tough enough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is also great.
I hope that we can build on it now, put it behind us last season and be successful."
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it with him,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of National Life Insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t disclose your wishes to them in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or using your own insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
You will appoint a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also, consider writing out full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in the event that you are not eligible to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just the finances in the game, but, for example, what are the names of the treating doctors?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready at hand."
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from an aerial
When the man returned home on foot after the night shift, he was hit by several shots from the airship.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase further.
Since the communications are out of order, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster erupted.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggal several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggale tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck west of Donggaly in 1996, claiming nine lives.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily incarcerated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old man living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating reports of domestic violence and preventing arrest.
According to police reports, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin’s phone was taken from her.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to a report by the network, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "definitely innocent" when asked for an opinion.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, by telephone.
The case is currently in court in Alaska for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violation of reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of war veterans for her son’s violent behavior as being linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the central part of Sulawesi Island, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there were videos depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Terrorist Suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – an exceptional punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck that discarded pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intention to award the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov for 22 crimes, including murder charges in favor of blackmail, which federal prosecutors routinely use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and preparation,” the plaintiffs claim, describing Saipov’s conduct as “abominable, cruel and perverse.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Dieg Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevese, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernana Diega Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagmenov."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York last handed down the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, proving a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regret, according to court documents, during the days and months following the attack.
Police said he felt good about what he had done.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also said they had demanded that the Islamic State flag be hung in a hospital room.
He said he feels innocent about the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of the admission of guilt and life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone they relate to," Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Conservative Party MPs should be entrusted with Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference today.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of May's own MPs suggested, he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would be “out by now” if Mr Farage was secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for a stay in the EU, who have joined a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from Chequers running under attack from Brexit advocates, proponents of staying in the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group was gathering in Solihull, where he wanted to “hustle off to Chequers.”
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out today,” he said.
Wellingborough added, “I’ll stand up for Brexit, but we have to squash Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought world wars so that we have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely out of the question.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not liked by members of our party or our activists who are currently crowding the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: ‘Ministerial presidents will retain their place if they keep their promises.’
Mr Farage said that conservative politicians must “get into an unpleasant situation” if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
He added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country that secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Britain that rules itself.”
Proponents of staying in the Union in the meantime marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved anti-Brexit banners to Conservatives after the party began its operation this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives because of security issues with the party's application after the conference began.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can secure IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"The whole thing is a frack.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Rethink Properly’ Presidential Candidates
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will “reflect carefully on her candidacy for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November re-election against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with city hall voters since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren said it was “the time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman in the highest place.”
Suspect arrested for shooting Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11:00 a.m.
A video of Friday's shooting was released with a request to identify the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was not life-threatening," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, said on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to moving around the scene, having a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was deported to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot, 6-inch tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world champion title as team management wins over Sebastian Vettel
Right when Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday's qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team management would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and urged Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling on the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove into the depot a bit later and after the exit he qualified for Vettel. However, Hamilton started ahead and in a close match, the Ferrari rider reluctantly had to leave the inner track free to defend in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen stepped out of the back row of the field and was in charge at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race because he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on a quick finish and be able to take Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it to the Depa in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was no longer able to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s assembly for insisting she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s renunciation before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and lying.”
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see these people being angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
“When you look at the releases and the releases and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you blame the leak?
Remember her answer... you published the document – oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, no," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information leaked in early September — but Feinstein refused to let her office leak.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose information about the case," Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
However, the president apparently did not believe her words, who spoke at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend a Supreme Court justice candidate accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suggested that Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power back by whatever means available.
“You see the ugliness, the ugliness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to dump into the country to get back to power and to the helm,” he said.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the lead due to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make it home before Dwyer returned to the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then equalised again for Dundee, whereupon the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe, who managed to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday.
The two teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendal McFaull assisting, while David Rutherford scored for Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got the home team back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the cabins for the first break only in the lead when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to score a goal from an overtime game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's joint work helped Nielsen to shift the lead to Dundee for the first time in the game later in the second third, and the same player secured the lead of his team in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost a fourth of their last five games, will play another game at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller has died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he died, overseeing the plane’s safe take-off with hundreds of people aboard.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake triggered by the tsunami struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of the 21-year-old Anthonis Gunawan Agung ran away to save his life, he refused to leave his seat in the swarming control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision had helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared the transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, with which he was transported to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities responsible expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is still rising as many bodies remain unexploded under the wreckage and many of them have not been reached by rescuers,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Pal have reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings more bodies here every minute.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
“Small shops are robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon in Micronesia
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific now said one person was missing, initially saying all passengers and crew of a total of 47 people had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to find a man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in a stable condition.
However, what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get water through the deep belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He further stated that the on-board personnel panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered a lighter head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working close to the dock repairs helped rescue the ship with an inflatable boat carrying passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-branded plane crashes in the last two decades, but no accidents have been reported to Air Niuguni.
Analyst Describes the Last Moments of a Woman Who Was Burned Alive
The indictment on Saturday ended its speech in this case, in which a man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert advice in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury sketched a scenario of using the cell phone records of 29 defendants, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When his cell phone data showed that he was spending the night with Chambers, he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the court in the cathedral and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
Asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lieing because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life entirely," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be heard by the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently met with revival thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black one?
New York-based educator sues couple for her dismissal after ‘racist’ text message
The New York-based educator sues a couple for her discriminatory dismissal after she received an erroneously sent text message from her mother in which she was labeled a "other black" text message.
The couple denied that they were racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed shock when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her new educator, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NONE, MORE BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to the Maurices twice.
When she understood her faux pas, so "concerned" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her outgoing educator, who was African-American, was really working poorly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for her dismissal from work and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month engagement she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the couple returned the blow with the fact that they were not racists, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employees was an appropriate measure, because they feared that after that insult they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your child to someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "extortion" and said his wife was only looking after a two-month-old child and was in "a very difficult situation".
“Would you drive around someone like that?
That’s not a nice thing at all,” the investment banker said.
Although the court case still persists, the jury on social media very quickly condemned the pair for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of stories about the Paddington bear feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, the latest reports show.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: “It’s hard to get into the situation of someone reading it for the first time, even before it’s published.
But it's really fun to know now that we know Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became "sweet and bitter."
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never at all bragging," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character for him, it was like having a child that achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart going slowly lost its effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly thereafter, and it was as if everything had closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head down, my tears running down my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an astonishing understanding of Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out Welsh Bridge postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can look for support.
Tyler’s son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and died at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room."
However, even before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his sibling’s immobile body after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about the impact it will have on his life.”
Ms. Davis proposed a postcard “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t be silent – you have to speak.”
Mrs. Humphreys, an aging friend of Mrs. Davies's, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down, or depressed, at all,” she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents, he didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something he actually asked for — a time-limited investigation, with limited scope — we could bring a little unity to it,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” because both parties would be kicked into the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if the Republicans behave badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in attempts to force the man they want to serve in the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush was calling the senators, lobbying with them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its own report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea for Kim "decreased"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the beginning of Kim Jong-un’s government seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there have been 1,127 escapees in the past year — compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park also said that there are stricter controls at the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the borders.
Pyongyang did not make any public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on the issue of sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for Supreme Court service because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman had ever performed such a theatre, they would have called it ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said their accusations against him were a “gross and coordinated attack” organized by liberals who could not cope with the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's resignation proved he was unable to work for the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this - if he's not telling Congress the truth, then he's not eligible to work not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she had concerns about Kavanaugh's potential returns in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse any Supreme Court rulings.
"There's no time for a hysterical, preoccupied person to go to court and expect us to just say, 'Oh, that's great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of vengeance, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A woman who worked as a director and told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a technique. This means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my inexpressible anger there by crying. But the older, always cold manager, who I was always a little worried about, grabbed me by the throat and grabbed me in the throat.
"Never show them you're crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“Seven other candidates have already been nominated and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had been running for a long time at the time, she couldn’t keep up with the donations, and so she pledged not to go into the match unless she won $2 million in donations.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, a frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money, and a focus on voters rather than delegates, and out of anger over sexism, that she had completely lost her mind.
"You might think I was nervous," Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
"Crying"?
Why China-US trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the rift between the countries will be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by taxing China’s exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the major escalations saw the light of day this week when new tariffs were announced on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which virtually means taxing half of trade exports from China to the US.
Beijing has reacted every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of 60 billion U.S. imports.
China has tried to repay the U.S. with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will kneel on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean retreating from its demands, but public submission to U.S. demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts think that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, a U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have admitted so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the American Security think tank’s Asia Center.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
“Today’s situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe responds sharply to victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of the trouble in France.
The United States has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team achieved the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tour, then threw the ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16th holes and gave victory to Francesco Molinarim.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the player of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world’s highest-scoring player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who was probably in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Weird statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played top-of-the-line golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's unsatisfactory results: "I'm proud of those guys, they really fought.
This morning, we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm pulling my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them captains.
I really need to stop.
You have beaten us.”
Red Tide Update: Concentrations Decrease in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota Districts
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall drop in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC report, stains of flowering water are now reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – this suggests decreasing concentration.
The blossoming water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinellas district to the southern Lee district.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was already relatively fewer places.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, medium concentrations were reported at the coast or in the open sea at the Pinellas district. In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed at the open sea, the lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, the lowest to high concentrations at the coast or at the highest concentration at the open sea at the Saratoga district.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwestern Florida last week.
