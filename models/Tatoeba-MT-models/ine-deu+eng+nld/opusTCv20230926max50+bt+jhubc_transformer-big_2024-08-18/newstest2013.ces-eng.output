The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such a fraud a myth, with voter fraud less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican attorneys have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections in the United States.
And in this spirit, since 2009, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws that make it more difficult to vote or enroll in the electoral roll.
This phenomenon has seen a spike since the November 2010 election, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote were submitted in 41 states in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, disqualify the right to register on the electoral roll on the day of the election, and deprive citizens of the right to vote by registering in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID card to be presented to voters.
The first state to impose this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of Indian law was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have supported such bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not own an identity card with a photo issued by their state government.
In addition, he does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their adherence to democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photograph exhibited by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required a proof of citizenship in the elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Spaniards prefer the democratic side.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states backed laws that abolished voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million people.
However, the measures adopted after 2009 caused a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Spanish.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Democratic governors blocked several bills by vetoing them.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
In part, they have managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics, in particular, talk about the bias of the passed laws and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes yielded incorrect results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All this further increased the hesitation of the men who had already hesitated to go for the examination at all.
To be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the USA have shown a high level of contamination between the individual test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found a different mortality rate between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who did not go for the test had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40, if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and those types that are intractable.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will propose active surveillance and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we are setting criteria that help in deciding which type to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that you take the exam.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember Movement has created a tool to evaluate for and against PSA testing.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease by adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone quits smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are inherited.
A certain percentage is also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely detrimental to human health.
“There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said Beaulieu.
Encouraging Fact: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight(s)
According to the SCC, exercise and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrients
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Excessive consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid freckles, for which the same applies.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins (vitamins)
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet come to a clear conclusion.
Studies focused on vitamin E are controversial, according to SCC.
Although according to one of them there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study rather talks about its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his family’s concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Subjecting to an examination does not mean you will have cancer."
Higgs Boson Examined
The announcement of a likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate uproar last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And then there’s the last particle whose existence is predicted by a standard model – our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is no 100% certainty among physicists that this is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have at our disposal an entirely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during a major physical congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data is still lacking to give us absolute certainty.
However, let’s assume it’s a Higgs boson, as the risks of error seem small, and let’s look at what’s really going on.
In this world, there is an absolutely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be bypassed - and do not try it too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their property.
It further divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli’s principle.
And at the other end there are the barons, the anarchists, who do not value anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" by which the great natural forces are propagated and with which the Higgs spp.
It must be said, however, that these barons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is due to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it cancels out the electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet rays, etc.) will arise, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the "carriers of force".
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it takes a different field, the Higgs field, to "disrupt" the boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for its excitation it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of the pond, which is already spread only by a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with support volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful for clarifying the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles and not all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold off on its own in the refrigerator.
And yet, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (like a photon, let’s look at it) don’t.
And Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> asks, what are all these researches, what will they "bring to us"?
From the point of view of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of SM.
In addition, not a few physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and fill some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, does not bring any clarification of gravity (uha!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the space mass (uha!).
However, the CERN facility has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responsibilities
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Look: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine it...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not initially plan it that way, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one never really knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through its Commission on Dignified Deaths, Quebec has recently become involved in a sensitive issue concerning the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue soon, and at the same time a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which fed him, gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's seven years," he says emotionlessly on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
Resigned, he looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop at his place, bringing him medication, offering him a bath.
Courage to die an ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of that diarrhea, it humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"Throughout life, one learns that men urinate vestibules," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child’s stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on which person’s abilities,” the psychologist says, “whether he accepts the return.”
According to the opinion of a number of people who deal with palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "curative" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "to suffocation with full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then allows us to put a breathing apparatus on her.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care with the help of nutrition is provided.
This is what palliative care looks like when you can’t do anything else.
To make death more comfortable.
Quebec has one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to his taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will drink a beer in honor of his deceased father.
“We help patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care Services.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days go by, but they do not resemble each other.
Next to a ninety-three-year-old man, who rejoices at the last meeting with his family thoroughly laid out on the pillows, while being toasted in his honor, tragically dies a thirty-six-year-old man surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children all over the place.
"For six months, there have been three to five beds that are intended for people with cancer under 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once a patient reaches the final stage of his or her life, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that causes a number of physicians specializing in palliative care to fear the passage of the Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Act.
Since October, the manifesto has been signed by palliative treatment leaders such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before they can agree to euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in huge pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to be killed because they are not receiving adequate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
The hopes of Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s survival were already very low when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told us.
And yet she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative foxes relieved them of their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal region, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which sleep the patient until the moment he dies, either by shock or if the sedatives are given to him permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will have an ever-increasing chance of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” that mixes construction, government officials, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters.
This "branch" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s interesting how the system has broken down since we took key action,” says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
It sparked a scandal in 2011 following a rigorous investigation into the embezzlement of funds under Quebec’s road construction contracts, which Quebec’s then-liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after lengthy delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of state officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars in contracts,” he says, as some people have kept their instincts in check to gain a share of them!
Charbonneau's commission "has already led two mayors to resign," adding that it hopes to "reveal the insincerity of some people."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also engages in combat with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the Marteau police force, which since 2009 has ensured that the Montreal “money cartel” significantly eases the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of searches and have accused a number of municipal representatives of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban municipality.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal indictments have also been received by Montreal-based transport engineers and Italian businessmen such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zimbito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which he was nominated by Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with cash lines whose prices were overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described it in great detail before the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to tours, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and handbags worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for an order with money.
Other public officials in the transport sector have admitted to having their bills overvalued by 30% to 40% through false multi-tasking.
Mayor’s party organizer Martin Dumont then accused Tremblay of keeping his eyes on the concomitant budget, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning against the sale of a communal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a thriving real estate trade since 2010.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says, “he’s pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system promoted by ants to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.”
The process is "painful, but positive."
We are in the wound-cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure oversight so that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially afraid of the role of "deputies informed about this deception" if they did not get into these chakras!
He estimates that 70% of election campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I’ve heard it’s just a weak decoupling of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to the parties to $100, but it will not solve the situation, according to him: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
He proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer fall; if we boldly focus on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a firmer foundation and with more control and compliance with the law."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who ridicules him to look at his own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone to each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come to us.
Every day, I get next to them.
The technical team has also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And in games, it's easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in preparation at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved by individual stages.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti has introduced...
The reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Does Ancelotti have the right word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with great players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In the first league, Lyon took the lead.
But we are still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we moved very easily to the eight-finals.
What is your goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group in front of Port first, so we can play in the rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget has already...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, it has to win titles and make history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league as in last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
“In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
It is usually true that with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think we'll make it this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are looking for the title, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It’s not uncommon to expect a lot from us because of what’s been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something in the paper that's blaming us, it's not exactly pleasant.
You ask yourself what more people might want from you.
You can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a style of play.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, which has not made it to the eight-finals for the second season, and they have also invested large sums!
Given the invested sums, you could be expected to have a lead over the other 15 points!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, which failed a lot last season, have moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
It shows how great the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
PSG seems to rely on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's the star of the first league.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
We respect people and players in our team.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I could not play as I imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
Today I am also able to play good matches in the national team.
And that’s what I’ve been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our speech exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’s first months at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the MS.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This match has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had not experienced such a game in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without a bank.
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between recipients.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political outlook here: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable but to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to $2, today it moves to the limit of about $10 (the exchange rate overview is given on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to “the most successful virtual money,” “competitive with the dollar and the euro,” and “an era of ordinary money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used to progress in a video game that a person acquires through a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the Central Authority monitors and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are book depositors of current accounts, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses by means of an e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction into this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, like a temporary central banker, will have the right to underwrite this additional line.
This is the cutting phase of a file; that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers will "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they will "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (a lot of zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, these rewards are regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but they can be divided into one hundred million, so there is room for margin here.
The difficulty of a given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The shell used does not relate to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the ledger of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not flowing.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul for the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of an educational book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just communicate the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin is rolled out, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. forces are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect anything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who we punished suffered the most damage because we considered them to be terrorists.
And so did we, because we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to the French loans, took place neatly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress between 1994 and 1996, the conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was then empty and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the land was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which was completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to our time.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women subordinate.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became craftsmen, took over state land, which they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them, moreover, were never even in combat.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people crave a government that won't be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the same way as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are already tired of war and the ideology associated with it.
During their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they came to know the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given a job, they will no longer want to return to the gloom of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in front of it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization modeled on Western states, but the U.S. wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister that had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964 was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
Since the 1950s, however, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been able to rebuild, no dam is working, no essential irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western states were here just to seize it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French departments at universities, French institutes, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "get your heart and soul" has worked, trying to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, in which the service of "civil-military steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) was then active, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a common order in the region of the uncountable French.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped dampen the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of arable land.
What kind of memory will we leave behind after two billion euros in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free these farmers from the insurrections led by foreign groups, they wish to obtain a small amount of civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected by them.
Difficult Work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has made his way to the next game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative further reinforced the country’s fragmentation.
From the opposition’s point of view, the president remains in his “autocratic delirium,” continues to “violate his word,” and “tramples the law.”
However, his supporters assure him that this is a means of speeding up the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum is due to be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the Egyptians’ intention to explain the text article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the entire country is being shaken by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for it.
Particularly because this hastyly organised vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will leave you with unlimited powers" that would otherwise have to end with the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 MPs of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
The majority of liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the proclamation of the constitution, they knocked on the door with the fact that they had no opportunity to enforce their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve readiness, 11 persons from the ranks of substitutes were rushed in yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further paused at the fact that one of the few disputes that day revolved around . . . hours for prayer, when some members of the committee felt that the hours in the meeting room were not set correctly.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2, ultimately remains the same as the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
“Cheating,” argue liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar university with an advisory role, in particular on issues of verification of compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is troubling because “people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of the theocracy.”
The concerns of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamites, but university workers, many of whom have studied in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing the work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions with regard to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to a religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, see red.].
And in the future, the question may arise to what extent civil judges are competent to express themselves."
In addition to religious pages, the text approved yesterday is heavily criticized for the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them compared to the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
In addition, the military courts will not prohibit the prosecution of civilians, as requested by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations are talking about their doubts in the context of the text which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef from the organization Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to deliver a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel are waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, the navel of the world and the sea of saturated salt solution
The promised land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the inviolability of nature.
The AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will descend on all who enter this “spa”.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here also Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will walk the Way of the Pain or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to the Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the Wall of Crying, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Entering the path vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruin is located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in climbing can reach it with their own strength.
The rest will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists are transported by a shuttle bus from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient manuscripts, or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also worth a visit is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
In his exhibition, the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with figures of the users of the spa and spa nurses of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops in the area.
Entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Yad Vashem Museum in Tel Aviv - tells the story of one of the most dramatic sites in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go inside – and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And there are the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving Your Health
Israel’s three major spa resorts lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aqua parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who are unable to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment with salt water - brine, and healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your broken nerves.
Touch the Mysterious of the Ancient Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the small town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were crossed by a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love hiking along the narrow alleys named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, in a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Buses are mainly used by the city, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in the city of Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
Basically, it's an underground cable car.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a transfer.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, he stops working in markets, shops and public transport.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you get only kosher food: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balls of ground porridge - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats, who gracefully "walk according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The forerunner cats love populated places and with taste they let themselves into every good.
According to the car brand, renting a car will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
To know the country and to rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on the language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating the mandatory language tests law, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, selling “fake” certificates.
Each year, 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law came into force, under which every working migrant will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail.
However, FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law also does not apply to people who successfully obtained a certificate and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question in the press many times: and what will this actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
Above all - the representatives of the migration service say - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in emigrants without work, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev with conviction - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him with a "pointer" to the terrible, narrow shelters in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend an entire 12 hours without food and documents.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they confiscate their passports, they don't pay the promised wages," Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration, said in a statement.
Don't cheat!
Moreover, many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they must leave for work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and undervalued."
It is true that, with regard to the Language Testing Act, human rights defenders point to one important point.
The tests will only be carried out on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take exams or get any more official work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers are living illegally in Russia as before.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entrance Banned"
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not at all easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Chuskadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the Language Act, it was found that it was not just the migrant registration documents that were faked.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of passing the language test.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hopes of facilitating the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption, so that workers can not simply buy documents, in which both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
So far, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time, the necessary time to take a course in the basics of the Russian language.
For visitors who do not know Russian, work is expected in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) is not putting the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low.
The MVD of Russia is submitting a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the cases of shootings at weddings that went without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by the way of "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "unreasonable tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminal in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while in the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the law in the field of civil weapons does not cause the perpetrator to move to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says Colonel Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept orders for weapons
The first of them - "military or military route", that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves also stole weapons," Baranec said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Lambec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of the authorities active in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" get for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires were intentionally set up - to cover up the lack," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the manufacturers of weapons also make their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive in the international market and are disposing of weapons that they are supplying to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and there's a mafia that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have figured out what the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market is.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed the statements of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "to be the fault of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was the theft of weapons during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" have not been bought by anyone for a long time - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the flagpole, the interested party buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you across the fence.
"He'll take it to the city and sell it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says.
“The truth is that the police are good in the picture, and that’s why whenever they start to burn out the plan in clarifying the crimes, they will make a check purchase from the illegal arms dealers,” adds the adviser.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Trial" platform, where there will be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we will act together.
I found out the price up there.
Military Reporter Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - a consultant.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers in the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to arrange that the daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through a person I'm sure of.
He will only give them to me because he knows I will not give them to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to become a publication on this topic.
According to him, the scheme has not changed.
They gave him an album of photos where there was "everything you thought of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, according to the words of Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, they do not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go to the woods with the seller and we set a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is firing well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Drawer on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontaktu", where they offer to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or a vending machine".
On this site, users leave their notices and ask questions.
Selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the journal is preserved).
"Buying TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently cracked down on a huge network of crammed websites, and people who want to buy a military weapon can scrape a shovel.
People swarm like hungry fish on bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military Reporter and Senior Military Officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are taking orders.
The buyer will make the payment via ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions where the gun is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the NGO "Right to Weapons."
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and be behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to Weapons" you will buy a Makarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the medium article.
According to the official statistical office, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the period January - October 2011, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7 percent.
In the U.S., fast food and supermarket workers are on strike.
Next articleWorking at the cash register of “McDonald” stores will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into wave nine, or whether it is destined to soon disappear.
All this action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries that line workers receive at Walmart and in fast food systems, the goal of the protest organizers is to achieve creation in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, captivated millions of residents and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of transnational chain companies whose goods are intended for people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at work.
The availability and assortment of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees little.
They also complain of poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
Demonstrators on “Black Friday” demanded an increase in wages and complained that the company’s health insurance costs rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the level of spending, employees say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on wages now.
If Walmart shifts wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and the company should not cause virtually any harm.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its treasuries made nearly 100 million transactions on “Black Friday.”
In an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman said that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"The unoccupied treasury!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where they were not targeted by Walmart's commercial houses (those in the aforementioned progressive city are not very popular, and therefore almost not here), but by "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councillor
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and New York State regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their line workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
No one in this expensive city has a lower salary.
I don't understand how you can live in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time after-school work and live with their parents will be employed at McDonald’s.
Few people see their main source of livelihood in it or plan to stay there for too long.
Currently, I’m constantly meeting in an interview with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast-food businesses start to receive at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the area of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and from punishing trade union activists by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is also difficult for objective reasons to set up a trade union in fast food establishments.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuations of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, loud protests also took place in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was a noon meeting at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald says he's selling billions of servings, and then he's not even paying you your sick pay and not paying you properly!"
Demonstrators also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand up together to support fast food workers so that they achieve the fair rewards for their work and the economic prosperity that every newory deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, although not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
So far, the brain has been able to deceive on average.
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means perceiving the world especially through the fringe of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference, Google presented a working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application for the novelty.
An interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already a thing of the past.
The perspective is the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us the framework, what does your research group deal with?
- We deal with human interactions with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has so far been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone is a very interesting option to control using gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
Despite the fact that the Kinect system has taken interaction to the physical level, a lot of interactions are still taking place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been separately.
We are trying to change that, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects in a much more suitable form to the real world.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It can certainly not be considered a medicine - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about bulky ones, just about such sloppy ones, short ones.
The gesture would not be perceived by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
With the current view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this assigns work to the designers of algorithms.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So it is also very important the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects a person’s interaction with a machine.
For me at work would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, not only do I not need so many touches, but I need some extra shots per second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it's actually a common sensor of visible band.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations carried out.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect system, play with curving the position of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smartphone in your raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" version of the extension of reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and so on.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, it is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are the responses your group is preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain type of substrate for display.
It records the compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibleness to these “pictures in the air” — for example, interference by several directional ultrasound rays at a defined point where the finger is located — evokes a tactile sensation, but it’s still very weak — as if you were blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to fool the brain yet?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time to come - how to get a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also
If brain deception becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
That's what makes virtual reality work so attractive to researchers - many things are in their prime.
Tasty instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrograd avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the artistic scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion taverns and at the openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of St. Petersburg’s purely social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being an urban person, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
Recently, he took the bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottlemaker, because he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city in red instead of yellow or turquoise?
- I chose the color red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
In spite of the fact that in general, everything that is a little different from gray, awakens aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation going.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in N<0xC4><0x9B>vsk<0xC3><0xBD>, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
Then there was a wave of old unofficial free artists and new, free types of artists I could not understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonians, who brought us to the Pushkin 10, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art clinic ...- It was important for me to be in the center of culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995 I took a place at Pushkinska 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
There many were born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how they brought String with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
Strings and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in adjacent jerseys, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, with which his great career, basic education and training he received from us began.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the echo of the Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regular guests left.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was organized in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named myself, which ended my climax.
In the new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are recognizable.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and pervasiveness are vividly captured.
I'll have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today to be so is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is erased, the tragedy is felt.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothes, orient themselves to the external mechanics, not to the inner man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the delusion will be removed by dressing up.
- We saw you as a city bottler recently. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, the commercial, utilitarian art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
Previously, people met in canyons, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
- He's got a lot of fans, and he's got a sexual social sphere involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land and 10,000 of them will not come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything will rot.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will deceive them and not disturb what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures of a collector hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often misunderstand.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
I am in favor of such a culture.
- Cyril, what's lacking in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: the clerk through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the time of the regular emperors, this was not the case at all, the emperors perhaps did not very much understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because we need great experts who will rightly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Taste is thriving today.
The same Erarta, but it differs in that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburk is?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And in our abyss, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but today we have more writers than readers, that’s wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with St.Pet<0xC4><0x9B>rburk grant
Birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set out on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in the conditions of weightlessness or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is too big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Sternberg (SAIS).
While there are better living conditions on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the issues of reproduction in space began scientists with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insects were brought into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a weightless state.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make swarms.
After 10 hours, freshly hatched birds experienced a complete extinction of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We had the birds licked twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in space Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew to the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion", however, there will be only single-sex beings.
There was an experiment with rats that were broadcast into space already pregnant.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sy<0xC4><0x8D>ev.
After landing on Earth with cosmic rats, offspring were born.
However, approaching the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet succeeded.
It's a difficult task.
Animals in the loss of the usual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thought and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the T<0xC4><0x9B>re<0xC5><0xA1>kovs.
The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Teak flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would last a flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," says veteran rocket-space industry veteran Vachtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina T<0xC4><0x9B>re<0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman-cosmonaut Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlana Savick<0xC3><0xA1> was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who, after many years, are born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valeriy Polyakov.
However, humanity must inevitably seek new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is an obligatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts learn the habits necessary to work in an open space.
Water mimics a state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is comfortable, but in a way a strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
Little Ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth originates from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first redemption, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little for a child to forget something," says Marina Aksenov<0xC3><0xA1>, a newborn swim instructor.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women it is more natural unavoidable gravity, an attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, are rapidly dislocated, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can put this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's body expels the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valeriy Polyakov intricate questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the body is not affected by the attractiveness of the earth, it is not able to properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn on the orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
It will simply be deprived of what it absolutely needs for its development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a person with disabilities to Earth who will be completely unfit for the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN Bioethics Commission.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will set out in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born into space.
Head of the NK<0xC3><0x9A>: Control of the Swiss system failed due to politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says this.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that's what I think is missing," Kala said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of the Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of incorrect practice, Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the so-called "black system" is cited.
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with his checks - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent an office that has the duty to control and enforce obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is handled, followed by individual national legislations and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the checks have not yet been completed, we have seen very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "stricter and more perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote ourselves to the application of the law itself.
What can this project do for you, what can it do for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us to stop trying to make laws more precise, to reduce and to improve limits, if it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal acts.
But by lowering the order limit, we don’t necessarily have to do that.
Perhaps the system is loaded with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar system to ours, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as we are, also has a college, is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal arrangement, it also has these accounting courts at the level of individual federal states - this is a little different from our system.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the county and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of federal accounting courts.
As for the legislation there, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is sometimes referred to as a model, but it can certainly not be said that it is better in everything.
Is it possible to have better controllers?
No, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even countries that we consider to be a model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be of any use to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for the domestic legislation, which for your office meant the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already manifest?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in our control actions.
Since we are doing ex post checks, we need to expect a certain delay.
We are only seeing this in the process of preparing for future checks - we have launched our new tool "risk detection of inefficiency", through which we have driven almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there the changes will of course manifest themselves as the limits change, the conditions of some types of tenders are adjusted and the form.
So do you consider the passage of this law to be a benefit or a further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can happen here is that she "strengthens" the rules and will not be able to comply with them.
Already during the operation of the previous rules, the controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to assume that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Does the law need to be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal error that has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's show ourselves where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "black system" - and what does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of an authority that has the duty to control and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are fairly strict rules as to what is to be done formally - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly – that is what I think is missing.
Roads are frosty, but mostly slippery
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are slippery, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were slippery this morning, but the places were frosty and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also less visible due to fog, according to data from the regional road traffic control.
The R6 motorway and first-class communications are now unrestricted in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On them, however, in some sections there are still remnants of frozen and places of trapped snow.
Especially in higher positions, increased attention should be paid to driving.
Pardubice and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost, in higher positions and in the mountains a layer of snow can be caught on the roads, informs the Directorate of Roads and Highways on its website.
Motorists warn drivers of frost, it can be formed especially in higher positions of the Pardubice region.
It can be found in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, especially on second and third-class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, it is usually clear or semi-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing weak winds.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen Region are slippery this morning, but places with increased caution and driving need to adapt to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
Seats must also count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the regional road traffic controllers.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, in southern Pilsen and Tachov there may be frozen sections.
Second and third-class communications are moist and also in this case there is a warning of frosty sections.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequent roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
With the snow mud on the road, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc region have to count today.
After the chemical spray, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
The road workers were driven out of the field by snow during the night, and in <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, roads are mostly unrestricted.
"In <0xC5><0xA0>umperska there is snow in the highest positions.
With the snow mud on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské saddle, the drivers must count towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," said the Czech Railways' dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration today.
Their colleagues also ventured into the field at night on Jesenicka, the roads up to and the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, drivers should be careful in forest areas where the roads have remained wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
Several hard-to-reach places are reported by road users in the north of the Czech Republic this morning.
In addition to several places with infested snow or with a glacier, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice to <0xC3><0x9A>stecke is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road users especially from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for her were at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night light and frost.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road between the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by the curved branches of the trees, which bent under the application of snow to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarming messages that we people like to get caught up in.
“Together with The Tap Tap, we’re more of a joke, saying we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to push or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to the readers?
This is a national charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before December 20 from 9 pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will once pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items such as shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Cancelled".
It is already very popular on YouTube today, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and this in the complete conclusion, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all three performers at the same time.
The hymns are also suddenly connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The words to this song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, also sings in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of charity events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in and enjoying working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts towards the end of the world go to?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kova Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov Institute are regularly visited by lecturers and are engaged in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them in this way.
As part of the extension of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What did you choose them for?
We have tried to build a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombing events" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, would like to connect this with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric trolley, its trolleys must travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and a bucket with tools...
However, until now it has always been possible without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how each differs in disability, public access to the disabled and the like.
What have you met with so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in full swing.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person to move on an electric cart alone in the center of the city.
There is no such thing as giving preference to wheelchair users in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civic associations that try to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, do we still have to pursue a more developed country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite common that even people with severe disabilities move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but it is only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really begin to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I started as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov Institute, where I had many young people around me who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I founded an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has come only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work on the promotion of the band.
We realized that work that is not visible, basically, as if it did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is filled with things where one imitates the other.
In a way, it is logical, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, it is natural...
But that regret is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
Has the fact that you are a strict boss, as many people have identified you, also helped this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, attend the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, then the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovi<0xC4><0x87>.
We are an open group, people come and go, that cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the taste, always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21:00
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fleda and Ostrava Plynojemu with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by telebridge while singing the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old have free entrance tickets in the pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of ESA projects over the following years.
However, Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts spent years in space before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Introduction to Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for Entrance to Cosmonautics in France.
The aforementioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of cosmonauts and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway dresina was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to launch the drezin or to brake it.
Information about this dressage is known only from the periodical press.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to take up missiles.
The research was carried out by the Armament Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckieg.
From the preserved materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work of Rakieta - the air torpedo and the rocket bomb by Leliwy-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was devoted to all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity it ended the beginning of the war.
Other works devoted to cosmonauts appear in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time there is a mention of the company in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the journal Problems, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with cosmonauts.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already underway and it was clear that space research is a prospective field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the fall PTA became a regular member.
And in the following year, the first president of PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been a major contributor to the development of the very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was later built, and in the summer of 1959 a flight test of the two-stage RM-2 rocket was launched in the Bled desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development was already capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type missiles became the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space with a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unrestrained financial speculation.
Due to the significant differences in the price of labour, (wage) there is a price tension.
By this term, it is necessary to mean the state in which a producer tries to maintain competition by importing cheap goods by "subjugating" a competitor's price in order to draw on itself a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, or there to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditures of the state necessarily increase.
The whole situation is compounded by the complete reluctance of businessmen to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage he has caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create in individual economies a situation in which the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in changes to the applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force the own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in disparities between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets in the SRN for many years for the poor who cannot live on their own labour.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that they have to be paid to the existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal House.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation when people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social level, either as it was in the 19th century, or to live on starving wages on the fringes of society in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
But here we have to ask where it comes from.
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty is moving from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, the Indian, the Brazilian, or the Turkish, the Moroccan, or the Egyptian, or the African are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media argue that the state cannot participate in its own economy by capital, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists strongly on the position that the state must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is a clear answer yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is punishable, but nothing is criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that, due to lack of funds, the ministries of state order the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are rigid in connection with industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power in this way does not come from the people, as Western-type constitutions say, but from financially strong groups that prefer self-interest.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as Appianus describes it in his Crisis of the Roman Republic during the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete disarray and the authorities have been occupying themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegal gain of favor, and the use of stones or swords.
Corruption and bribery roared without any hindrance, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote, but the people did not apply for office at all, so once, as a result of this upheaval, it was possible to stand for eight months without consuls. . . .
Conclusion As in antiquity, today’s society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest, regardless of the interest of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature no longer able to understand and apply the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform more deeply.
We must therefore seek the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal type of democracy can be regarded as a certain pause in anticipation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that current elites are completely ignoring the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

Some stand behind Israel, argue for its right to self-defense, and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodically recurring waves of killing by the culprit and who the victims, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
It’s about offering readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who has been in the service of the 95-year-long tension (calculated since Balfour’s declaration in November 1917) over a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can look for some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomously directing their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in the lifetime of a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one who might consider himself to be the head of the octopus (if there is still someone standing above them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
There's not much written about them.
Of course you do.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) in the 1990s to stop the association of their name with the highly criminal acts against which they stood and which have always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank do not lead or prepare for war (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subjugated the central government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of Rothschild's Bank of America, began spending his own (understandably government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in the theater in 1865.
JFK began to spend its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led, from 1859 to 1871, to formulate a plan of three world wars by the mason of the highest, the 33rd degree consecrated by Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to eliminate the absolute colonial rule especially of Great Britain, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves are not enough for their comfort and luxury and do not consume so many resources), to create a unified society (so many slaves are not enough for their comfort and luxury and do not consume so many resources).
The method by which a group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds are working is to provoke a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat a crisis like the one they provoked in 1907).
So after they succeeded in assassinating the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded, capitulation of Germany (no longer needed war for the destruction of Imperial Russia) and the subsequent split of the Central European power, Austria Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the political bankers made a very latently conflicting situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverishing masses, and then it was enough for them to underline the situation of the Germans, who were sufficiently strong and guilty.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds spurred the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler had broken off the chain on which he was initially held by international bankers, or all he had planned was hard to guess, anyway the suffering of European Jews in concentrations created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as war reparations to Germany led to World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focal point of the Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the other, will be the victims in the front line of battle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s just take how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where injustice produces injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers push people to choose their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk of Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, to international bankers loyal, a policy that does everything to start a war with Iran, which, due to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Organization for Co-operation (China, India, Russia and Pakistan), would control the...
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn is implanted at the birth of a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
“And he forces all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that they may not buy or sell anything that is not marked with the name of the beast, or with the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand this: who has reason to count the numbers of the beast.
That number denotes a man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohamed Rez Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patronage of his regime for several decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - throwing chess overboard could not afford, because it would fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the failure of the attempt to free the hostage by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
Debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
A film directed by Ben Affleck, Argo depicts one episode of the story that America brought to a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six staff members fled from it.
After complex peripetes, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film staff, who watched locations in the country for sci-fi big-movie shooting.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, understatement - an example can be Danny's series of partners.
In the film, moods are thus alternating - on the one hand documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were depicted in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, a lightened passage from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to re-start his career in a remarkable way.
The mocked actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime dramas Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Affleck that does not take place in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that raised the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when they are cleaned up somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his associates in the scenes of the imaginary (false staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not really offer much in the cinematic sense of the tense scenes.
He works quite successfully with it, sometimes he thinks of reality - everything does not come out so elegantly (the scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns off the phone call in America and the hunt for a ranch seems quite drawn to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the diffraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
While Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charismatic in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic momentum, it is a film that can be watched with a slight interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it's hard to pull it off.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led to the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the Law survey.
Among the nominees, for example, is the recent European Court of Justice ruling on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by people by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory mixing of bio-compounds into fuels, which, as a result, harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken coops from cages.
Critics have also previously faced a factual ban on the use of the term butter or the elimination of classic bulbs from sales.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimetres
The Union apparatus often decides under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so that the Czech Republic now also enforces the demands of its banks with the threat of a veto).
The interests of the lobby were also based on the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and could not show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only the previously disparate national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU has already softened the rules on fruit and vegetables, despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year’s EU regulation, according to which inflatable balloons sold must be notified that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without the supervision of adults, can also be a candidate for the victory in the survey.
The EU has referred to US research, according to which balloons between toys are the leading cause of death of children for suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing in pelvic floor scrubs.
Curious ideas are born at home
There is also a rather absurd rule concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplaty.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire nominated in the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, including the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food supplies that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting grants on request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of so-called intervention purchases, he had to become full of stocks that he had to export.
For having the Czech Republic further to the ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palase.
The European Commission finally came out to meet the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for the grant was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel DEU (US-DEU), in particular, they were to go to the writing of the application for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
Regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, and the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to work more effectively and develop the Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, for example, according to experts, is drawing on EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States during budget negotiations.
Emotion among Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, while not always succeeding in this fight.
The Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, defended the designation of Olomouc shapes, but the native rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers as a native.
The names of rum can only be derived from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parma ham has already found, for example, Karlovar sauerkraut, pogorelic and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBE>atecki hops.
Pardubice perennials and algae tubes can also be awarded the EU trade mark.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does one think he wants to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I don't run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country robbery over the last twenty years, thieves running around here, people raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and an independent independent, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you were on your way to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the castle, according to the result of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for realizing my vision.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
But the problem is not only that we, as a nation, run in pubs and on television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this is the media, which dishonors a person and confuses the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
I was alleged to be bribing a journalist or to have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubko.
Let's get to your visions.
You have embarked on the battle for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property confessions of over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
But as president, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for guidance to be a free trade, I succeeded in enforcing it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, the approval is rejected, and it delays the citizens.
As an independent independent, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you see yourself as a leftist or a rightist?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are placing me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little left or a little right.
It is important for me to move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You get mad when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without Parliament’s support, you’ll only have your passwords.
You won’t be able to do that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility, for example?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to our side to enforce it.
If I were elected president, there is no problem in organizing a television live broadcast where I will ask the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate substantive and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will name impurities, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
At the same time, I say that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my views and visions, I try to find allies.
I have just started politics, and I will try to gain majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've been circumventing a lot of well-known people, whether or not they'd also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused due to the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenca, who was exposing fraud with light heating oils.
I ran with people being really dissatisfied, but now I'm on a leash.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have elected the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or heytmans.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential party's clean past, and I don't have the money to do it either.
I don't even have money for a presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property statements, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant towards women and at the same time fought against bad and dirty things.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for a campaign.
Is that what I'm indebted to?
I've already spent $2.5 million on the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that I’m not interested in my program.
And I'm not obligated to pay the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover how much senatorial salary I'm going to get.
But I wouldn't make the most of it, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd dampen these activities?
But it has nothing to do with salary.
As I promised, I partially subdued my activities.
For example, my representative will be the director of the tour in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much were you used to taking monthly as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take further.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.

The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not take place only in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 pictures
"The building looks cheerful, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby big company, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
I would like to know why we still need a library.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-fashioned libraries voluntarily anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a residence close to Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not dizzying.
And so the city councilors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely daring column graphs and maker of funny, often even cynical constructions, accepted the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at a competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and on his arm.
And while the commission was still looking around and shrugging its shoulders, the daring Maas put his gifts on himself according to the size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear city village!"
This, then, is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain for 30 million euros was completed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjoining residential and detached houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small town gray, which could not yet offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is therefore richer with a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: the reader’s eldorado under the cheese cover.
A lift runs through the mountain massif, but you will only discover real spatial and readership passions when you walk past the topography.
From all sides the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt lobster and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally there are bookshelves along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and there is a large dark space in the middle, which is usually inconvenient and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We’ve built the classic spatial configuration upside down, and we’ve moved the reader space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are once the lining of the walls, once the parapet and once the railing of the stairs.
Appearance, structure and smell seem foreign.
Above the unknown building material, they even swear by architects and construction engineers.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town of Spijkenisse, at the request of Standard magazine.
So one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, millimetre synthetic wool has been used as a base under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons and then is ripe to be thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed onto plates four centimeters thick.
By acting on heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a little like a new car and a little like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but especially about the proper humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for the New Soul
“You might not believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the heat of the earth.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines in only a short time, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden rivets, which stand perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an early skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Buchenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, the first optical gaps were to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
In doing so, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young or uneducated.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the adoption of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Berlin is thus balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal on the observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis were doing in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, of course, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This is where NATO finally came in.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, from a policy that was so-called controlled by the US, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just getting settled in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, as they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and by its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Were economic interests influencing the position in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, they must be careful not to deter the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I don’t want to put too much emphasis on it, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany’s relationship with the US been damaged when Germany abstained in the case of both important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a break as in the question of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This indicates that he must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration probably has a deep understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, this position cannot, of course, be held in public.
I don’t think the differences in opinions are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy at all.
Isn’t it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the EU’s most important partners on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international player? Does it want to take over the leading role at all?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes on a greater role, anti-German sentiments will arise.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States is.
It must be acceptable to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and will make them even more popular - c'est la vie!

‘Protecting Brands’ in China: When Puma and Armani Are Suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a brand that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as they are not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then it is not clear whether the law will prevail.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in violating protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters already need a few extra letters to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and Prada-Kny will be registered instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens an organizer with the records of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was granted protection for the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also parasitizes the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
However, Pattloch's cases are different; on the authority of his mandates, he proceeds against the Chinese companies being given the full official right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women mean when they hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The signal dilutes, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to the market research firm CLSA, China is the third-largest luxury goods market and the fastest-growing market with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, the erasure of dubious entries in the trade mark register can be difficult and costly.
The drive can last up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits because the denounced name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he must still pay the plagiarist for damaging his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.
The well-known cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete mixer pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO recognises that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to the too small number of staff and premises.
But last year, "the course of the work process has returned to normal from an emergency situation."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, up 75 percent from the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints to be resolved.
Something to do about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO delivered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is the fifth in a row to have a list of new applicants around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected from the fees.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times to start a dispute, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved that its illegal production of imitation car parts has been abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have omitted it ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO then also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg has obtained the rights, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company, they even had to look through a hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterparty in vain a "high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what that means to us," Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East threatens to hit Europe as well.
And that's in case the imitators there secure unprotected marks.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to apply for the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since been abandoned by the Group, but it has managed to refuse registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and his lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything that is worth protecting in any way, even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay the counterparty licensing fees for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: bellowing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir tests - and in Swaziland, the orphans are happy about it after their parents died of AIDS.
The story of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the bullshit: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins look for the clock on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are pressed, mumbling and persecuting each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he joins his voices with his savage gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, ranging from a human genetics researcher to a housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every church voice has a different text and even more so in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help help
Unaids, the United Nations’ programme to combat AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patronage in Germany in the village of Esitenjen.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 per month, patronage can be taken over.
It guarantees the child a school uniform, a school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means in Zulu language "the storyteller" or "the one who praises".
In this space, no one can speak, only sing, the gas Bantu language.
For almost a decade now, the choir has been practicing the soft language of the song and occasionally bringing it back to where it originally came from: to southern Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, the village of Essiteni is located in the northeast of the Swazi Kingdom, which is dependent on the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Essiten, the whole of Swaziland can be seen in a small rock: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus with weakened immunity. It is not uncommon for them to die in their 30s.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005. But above all, the members of Imbonga saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothes, education.
Without a high school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed to send the child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a choir of "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since cared for orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Flakes and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and dizziness occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are common, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), gout, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected people belong to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What Are the Symptoms of Sexual Illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
The risk of infection can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partly transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to sponsorship, charitable donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
“In total, we have already sent around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 to Essetten,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the very village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can enforce herself.
She also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example with one of her grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu language says to old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, put a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children show up every day in their uniforms to school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter at Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa founded a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to have their HIV test done.
Even though the disease is so obvious all over the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it's quite strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immoral lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame, among other things, for the rapid spread of HIV in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different – unprotected contact.”
To at least a little promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years together across southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combat, confidence in the future and the self-confidence of blacks that many in the southern tip of the black continent still know apartheid from time to time.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitenjen, where the singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than famous in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Essien, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers away by air line, to the dull singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see the light shining here too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday by the expert magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice cover in the region of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps even from asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not put the finding of ice in the context of the existence of life on this planet, said lead scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other basic elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix, unseen Earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, images will be sent to Earth, a small window into infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition.
This excerpt from an infrared image from Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, the worst identifiable are pink-colored "newborns" in the birth hall of the stars.
This region where stars form — scientists call it non-romantic W5 — was discovered by Spitzer’s telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This ever-changing heat of dying stars was captured by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The ring is made up of material that the star has cracked during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years from Earth, a new star is formed from gas and dust.
A photograph of the galaxy's "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors are better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer on this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the terrestrial continent has led to this nebula being named North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the originator of unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to capture in full beauty the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It may be the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the Hubble Telescope's largest and sharpest images: the vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloration, become real works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light-years away the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar nativity scene into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosha, astronomers have photographed the foreshadowing of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nucleus of two fusing galaxies is at each other’s feet and must inevitably collide.
This birth of a star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical shortcuts can call it the Southern Windmill.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This nebula, 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was detected by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, connected to the Rosette Nebula, are giving birth to ever new young stars, 5,000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created only shortly after the Big Bang, when there was hydrogen in the universe.
Our gaze into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey and was used a year later by Galileo Galilei to observe the stars.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have been steadily increasing – and the views they mediate are getting deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It makes it possible to look into the universe with the help of two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, its average is about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the low-cost construction method: the telescope is secured by a hook at a high angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who will make its computing power available.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here - and does the honor of its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters in length and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two of Keck's telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Maun Kea Observatory, which also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-metre mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most important impressions from space are given by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing us with images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 – especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board the Ariane 5 in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
A trip through the Taly<0xC5><0xA1> Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus whirls along the road with many bends along densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple rural buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, we almost seem to be in the Black Forest.
However, this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, which is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is of very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-current.
The fairy-tale wealth that countries owe to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the countryside.
Pilate Fatulaeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik is on the verge of becoming a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Taly<0xC5><0xA1>s from the area, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, she gave birth to a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irala Müslümov, who was reportedly 168 years old.
A birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm's age seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he reportedly still had a daughter.
Didn’t <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov make a mistake at the age of a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about elderly people in Central Asia.
"Apparently many older people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially if the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
However, the fact is that people in the area around Lerik experience the Bible age noticeably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
The director of the Fatuljev Museum, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of the Talys who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzajeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young to this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterfly that he tirelessly tickles.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armada".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth make up the perfect line and under the scarf she hides a long dark blond copy, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn’t look like it and kept the color.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzaeva says.
A Monthly Retirement is Enough
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
I have never bought food in a supermarket in my life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But it all got better when the paddle was taken over by "beloved father" Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that takes place around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no limits.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the paddle by his son Ilham.
Older people in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from need.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the amount that can be used well for the local conditions.
And perhaps the long-suffering son of Mirzayev is also right: "Old people enjoy a great deal of seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.

But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians have no idea.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs swiftly approved by the Islamic-dominated Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour night marathon are partly disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, this proposal also says that jurisdiction is based on the “principles of Islamic law.”
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the legal space associated with it for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this is illustrated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, one should consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislature, which would bring to justice the de facto deprivation of jurisdiction.
There is a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is so inaccurately formulated from a legal point of view that, by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, it means nothing more than censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing limits the explicit equality of men and women.
However, another paragraph forbids the blasphemy or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
It is unclear, however, what the defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally doubtful is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
In this case, is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of law experts enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many others in this motion, which Mursi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
“The revolution is back.”
For several weeks now, there has been an uprising against the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual junta on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it even came into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamd<0xC3><0xAD>n Sabbah<0xC3><0xAD>, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, said the draft constitution belonged "to the rubbish bin of history."
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to carry out a “coup against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasir Said said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," opposition politician Khalid Ali said in a statement.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, thereby rendering it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a resistance demonstration, but out of caution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and followers of the Salafists, who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Morsi, "Purify the earth," and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably evoke a state similar to a civil war.
Morsi's supporters obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said the opponents and proponents of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the polling stations decide which direction the country should go.
The majority is considered certain in favor of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't even occur once"
An enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is raging in the Hafize of Abu Sa'du.
An eighty-four-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court for Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And there is no 'human rights' in the new constitution now," he complains in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's extension of power to all three powers in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he actually abolished it," Sa'da complained.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions in the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could get away with it.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian raccoon: the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be associated with a local appetite for extraordinarily fragrant fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
So you get the smell of paralyzing stench of rakfisk, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, beautiful views - and there's an omnipresent smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets darker and colder, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to, as they say, the best, most enticing food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit than a crayfish,” says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish soaked in airtight barrels with water and salt in the fall.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses no doubt numbed with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, most of them emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to a large amount of work, high earnings and extensive care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who was much richer than Norway recently, are flowing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, although a rather fragrant part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway is often not in the global news - and it seems that this is the way it suits most of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year, is still reluctantly mentioned here.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
“Oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Its English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is completely impeccable.
We don't pretend, we don't like the show.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial collapse were throwing away money that they didn’t have, the Norwegians had the cords tightly tightened on their pockets.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat a raccoon," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of raccoons.
Such a salmon burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places where raccoons are served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast, in which a moderator with a butterfly is surrounded by plates with a raccoon.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
From the chair will fall a man, perhaps made by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Sword and take over the leadership of the nation.
Faced with a challenging task.
Mexico was doing well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in good.
The citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now get to the city via one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the piercing and bumpy roads that used to be here.
The plates with his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," said friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state lawmaker for President Pena Nieto's Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was suppressed by Vicente Fox.
MEP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected inside the party from Enriqua Pena Nieto.
And he rejects the opposition's statements characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very interested in the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most of all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Nestled under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing village are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was summoned to help deal with drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly fervent violence against women.
Only in the last two years have the bodies of dozens of murdered women been dumped in empty places next to a huge landfill.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, much more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say that he failed to adequately address the problem of women’s murders in his office.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a desolate neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked like someone had washed her body," Mrs. Buendia recalls.
There were marks on him after the strokes, and the postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which there is only one word: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what was opposed to them.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old clown, troublemaker, and priestess.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has vowed to be his priority for the duration of his tenure in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said Pri Olvera, a member of parliament in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Mistreatment, Military Prosecutor Says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegation of gross incarceration.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis of rough handling of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Ashden Fein, during a cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of Manning's weekly visits to unit officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not indicate any wrongdoing.
The cross-examination, which took place during the hearing conducted at the request of the defence to dismiss the case brought against Manning for gross treatment at the time of detention, which is in itself sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he had considered the detention.
A military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday’s hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the forms that officers had filled out after meeting Manning at a detention facility in Quantico, where he was held under increased surveillance from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards was "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of mistreatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally, and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and suggested that they would deal with them, but did not notice these problems.
“They wrote down ‘no problems’ (after discussing concerns) and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention them,” Manning said.
Judge Lt. Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment in January 2011 at a meeting with the Suicide Thoughts Commission, which he had expressed a few months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The army stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under the regime of surveillance for suicide) to protect him and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transportation to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at a Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once there he fainted because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the surrounding world was very disappointing.
"My world has crumbled only to the base of Arifjan, to the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, nasopharynxes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the handling of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Justice Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday’s statement that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates in the morning count.
Manning said that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
At a hearing on Friday, Judge Manning stated that he had decided on the orders of his guards that he had a blanket that he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had given him the order to defer it.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he had tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his nasal nostrils to hurt himself, but he didn’t.
Manning recounted that his underwear, his eyewear and his glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the event of his conviction before a military court, the start of which is expected at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it planned Manning to plead guilty to lower crimes and that he would fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend detention conditions as warranted.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with the regulations regarding all detainees held in maximum custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of national security information, and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged in all cases, he may be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the insufficient opportunities that are there.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely got through the crowd and arrived at the space for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Foreigners" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So I later ended up labeling myself a "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I do not know how to get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for the "Foreigners".
I was thinking about the time this week when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House.
They had the usual issues on the agenda, which are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
It wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under threat of arms to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical about Mexico, you will hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will step on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people the country offers options to, and others who don’t.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are living the American dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and see us as a subordinate race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left him.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are and Mexican Americans don’t like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of any.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in either one.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence I learned during my trip want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American compatriots how great it is to visit this country, and push political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
There are too many hostile feelings.
And because of income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel uneasy about the way their family members were treated substantially more closely.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such action is futile.
Among the usual futile speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into wrecks, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it will make their fight even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to believe that it may interrupt their deadly duck situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason to be optimistic at the moment.
Even if the November 21 ceasefire lasted, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its embittered Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists around the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, joined Hamas, as did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Blissful people from Hamas say that the Islamic crescent is circling around Israel, north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/militia is ruling, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly clinging to Islamism can deploy Bashar al-Assad, as far as Jordan.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Mohammed Mursi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab country, has altered the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player that cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardline proponents will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, partly thanks to a wall that invades the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects against the international settlements that are becoming increasingly Jewish.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It'd be better if we held them behind the wall and beat them up when they put their heads out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not have much love for Israel, their top priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than the spending of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
As the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, a denial of Palestinians’ rights to self-determination creates a barrel of gunpowder that must explode one day in Israeli-occupied areas – just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already today, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are worsening this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks on Gaza that take place every few years in order to suppress Hamas will be increasingly subject to a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers say: two states, where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this thing.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must take steps to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside must also push for an agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would be more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the UN to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term in office, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia's Ugly Cigarette Packaging Laws Come Into Force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, show warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, and the logos and colors of the labels replaced the general olive green boxes with ugly images of the diseased parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborns of the ill as a result.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, mandatory from Saturday are the only difference between the boxes of brand names, which are printed in the same small letter.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by depriving them of their attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking until the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children link the crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have only a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been heavily lobbying against these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase black market trade, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring much more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover nasty boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco almost lost their sales from the appeal to the law.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new inventories.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hurdle, experts point to the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Across a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the rating of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and did the job and created this video, or is a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it deals with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected to be adopted in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are defiant.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out your cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack traffic in central Sydney, says it’s harder for him to level up on the shelves thanks to the unified boxes.
"It took me an hour to load, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them altogether, then we'd say, 'OK, that's the end, let's close the store,'" he said, shaking his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is quite annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with the praise of boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we don’t have a chance to get bored.
Should we support boredom?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a fairly new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience “I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it”.
Boredom is different from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that in apathy there is no compulsion to do anything.
He says that the core of boredom is "disruption of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Uningaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which the person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV show in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV show quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups — they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and knitting, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people more physically alert.
“Research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the screaming loudspeaker, a particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the “Boredom Proneness Scale.”
The scale includes questions such as, “Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally non-judgmental.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom expressed would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that “adolescence is a peak time for boredom,” which is largely due to the fact that children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“Nudity is the brain’s way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate control is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable when we are within reach of the constant squeak of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state — for holding a few grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke her.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was driving with several friends in Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offenses for which there is a fine of $100 for each - and he was given a court date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession violations have already been lifted here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado districts have said they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, and are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana shops in their municipalities.
"This thing is going so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads up and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale – all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what could work.
“There is no real precedent for us to follow,” he said.
Washington’s I-502 law comes into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal ownership does.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state’s directive on “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on trade in cannabis within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently-founded research group.
On November 21, Aurora City Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers in which he announced that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offences for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would stop “with immediate effect” accusing people of these offenses.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a more rigorous view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, there are 119 people facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred," Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places such as the rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of a small amount.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed a deep division among local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For district attorneys, it’s a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana possession defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They've spent so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for drug legalization.
Lawyers and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients using it, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to knock out the door to capture a small bag of drugs, they are likely to oppose allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana trades permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the president.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the progress of the federal authorities.
Before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana trade, although it will take about a year before any trade can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban and is likely to take effect next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We look at what the community voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There are really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative.”
It’s not just today’s university students who are being attacked.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest home of knowledge, a modern, winding Greek symposium that motivated the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and swirled into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I had objections to loving students in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson resolutely declared that I had left because I had been forced to drink from the beaten cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative supporter.
You may ask why I'm pulling this off right now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center is suffering from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Younger Men’s Association (JCR) claim that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown to be unwelcome.”
They call for the creation of a position on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
Their situation was not helped even by the recently announced BBC Two documentary series Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which the Conservatives portrayed as bizarre and neo-Nazis.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit, and had a wand with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as "sacrificial lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday's newspapers that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while 19-year-old OUCA President-elect Stephanie Cherill says the JCR’s approach to people on the right of the center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I started in September 1986, 18 years old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most ardent.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deny the honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be afraid of the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students meet with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the hay that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors quietly approve of bullying conservative pupils, but they are also willing to participate.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and resistance of the government against the sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic was introduced into the wood-lined auditoriums.
My first lecture dealt with the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I've been pretty hard on it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very bile-like.
"Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students sneered.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you're not too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt said.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight tapping on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me already, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Most conservative first-timers pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who (what an irony) went to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a Labourist and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me, they developed as a purifier of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for its provinciality and smallness and for its inclination to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, seeking refuge with my uninteresting metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were adopted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His swollen eyes dried up.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional endurance deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week during the course of the lecture, when another professor of history declared in absolute seriousness that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I blushed inside with shame, I confessed that my “parents brainwashed me” and called them “old fools.”
The relief was only short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was knocked down by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a slapped weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only emerged 14 conservative premieres, but which also hides to this day behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino's got more elegance than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the exhibition of Valentin Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and remote world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which lasts until March 3, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international "bohemian cream".
To love the royal family is not a bad thing.
“At least they don’t put a cigarette in a great carpet, as some great pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests are entertained abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.”
Valeria Mazzova presents Valentina
The charism of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazzova.
"It's been many years since we went to dinner with him after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy younger.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he sighed and was feeling his spirit.
Everyone invited was able to feel important and loved thanks to him," recalls the top model who began working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"It will never go out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Parade of infatuation
His life is not a story of obsessions, but of real love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the Galleries of Somerset House was rebuilt to a special seventy-metre-long pawnshop, a pawnshop, which offers a role change: the visitor turns to a model and marches through the pawnshop to observe the "commendation" of dreams that he had on his Valentine's masterpieces like a dress, a pawnshop that he had chosen in a Jackie Kennedy's dressNo.
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine in the audience.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that first Valentino is first love, "you can't forget him".
"I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muse.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women because he emphasizes our beauty," said the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten a lot and give a 'flash' to the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget how she dressed Valentina for the first time.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
Eventually, it reached the end of the 90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino for the celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Eduardo de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had skirts with rudders, lined waistcoats and a top without straps.
It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodriguez d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains an Italian aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories they have in them".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with all-embroidered pearls, twelve types of different lace and a drag of four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "shakes" (as the designer calls his seamstress).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the biggest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of the Legion of Honour amass as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, his calmness, his refined and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was flawless, leaving no trace of time on him."
If the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4, Indonesian Volcanoes gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living from mining sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day he has to snort to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and when in contact with air, it goes into a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along rough stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which stands 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take over 40 minutes to climb at the turtle's pace because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and collapse into the abyss.
They know that any trip could become their life, as it happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract
When they are up, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to a weight that the mining company has placed just below, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar bleaching.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually does three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and in the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems like a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage of miners is very high here. For example, for collecting coffee, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day and the salary in fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is a Jav is a Hindu, and she is a J<0xC4><0x81>l<0xC4><0x81>va."
Anto has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks life in the Kawah Ijen volcano three times a day, whose sulphur has already begun to collect its tax on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he says.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man arrived by fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the work of a carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur does not cease to ooze at night and its characteristic yellow color turns to blue and shines dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto wanders into the crater and lights his way with a small torch, which he has attached to his helmet and bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers carrying sulfur from the bottom of the crater on the shoulder basket
Although the company has high revenues, due to cost savings, it has not mechanized sulphur mining, nor does it provide carriers working on their own and with such an effort, with any equipment.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography surcharge, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), is picked up by the nature park’s guardians from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old sturdy carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
She manages to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that she will last to work “as long as possible” because she needs the money to educate her three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulphur burns the throat and gnaws in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in dense vapors coming out of the volcano, the miners are so stubborn that none of them complain that they suffer from serious diseases... but it is clear that they suffer from arrhythmias and arrhythmias of their frequent respiratory sweats.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues dump 15 tons of sulphur into the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks along a steep road between the pontoon and the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, a thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Ilyn.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they have no children, for their careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of a menthol candy commercial, but still – or perhaps just because – the video in Singapore mass-produced on YouTube earlier this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local hints like "let's put a buckle in the oven" as a mockery of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that this advertisement will be able to alert them to the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency’s artistic director, said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people “fulfill their civic duty.”
“It’s all about the internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this is a topic that we need to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rap composition, to solve this problem."
1.2 children.
The one who doesn’t take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
It will spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population distribution is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Office’s marriage and family department, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth. The result is a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has caused discontent among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, there is undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence began last year.
After the elections, efforts to solve the problem appeared through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, says their “shoeboxes” sell far faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular because they sell for days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That’s why they are much better for our cash flow.”
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Excessively stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation’s fertility rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city centre suggests they won’t have much effect.
“People are still under stress, homes are expensive, as is education, which is why a lot of people put it off,” says the young official.
"Let the others have children.
But it’s important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about 20-year-old young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is ultimately the Singaporeans who have the final say in starting a family.
What is private offline is private and online
-Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or “an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" on the personal level and to be a "username and password" when it came to social networks.
“I wouldn’t disclose my biggest secret,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he says.
"I'm posting nice pictures or pictures of us playing on FB.
I also talk to people I know.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I created a Twitter account so that I could express my views and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends,” she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the networks Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and on the last mentioned network admits that he does not know 20 people from his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them were pointing him at anything, nor did they want an address or a phone number after him.
“If they insist on me or ask me to do so, I will simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These boys are not strangers to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
According to Jose, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You've just activated your private mode."
It then explains a series of steps on how to securely set up an account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of the field of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented in social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
"The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academician Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to be taught, and yet we are still learning by ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature."
Also, to be considerate - as far as the environment is concerned - at a time when what they want most is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras lists out some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted it to a friend?
Do you know what others say about you?
When you mark people in photos from celebrations, did you ask them for permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles and the same should be on social networks,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is essential for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand every scam, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, as far as age is concerned or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardian believes it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of “don’t talk to strangers.”
The Summit of South America ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and which was allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
The EFE has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential offices, who initially determined that the document would be published after the summit ended, said it would be published later on the website of the UNAsur.
They also said that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a few brief press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "confidential meeting, the transmission of sound prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by press representatives of some governments who were present at the meeting, but not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of presidents participating, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to ask for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although it was eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the defence speech of both parties on Monday to discuss the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
“We will submit to and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court,” said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they will be subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice was published after Colombia adopted the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia made the decision by mistake.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rousseff), Venezuela (Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the resignation of then-President Fernand Lug and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and concluding the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements, he mentioned that UNASUR member states will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which is why the residency agreements are being extended."
He said that actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters" are being supported.
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not be victorious, but should serve to increase our productivity and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different places in South America, especially rural and border areas ... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a speech read.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the transversal axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two others relate to better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues that the summit highlighted was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is integral and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to discuss with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice regarding the dispute over the maritime border dispute.
“It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
"We will negotiate all solutions, none of which are excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and thoughtful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta.
Within the framework of the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, must really learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the member countries of Unasur support.
"There is a need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of backwardness that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights be taken into account.
“Those who are in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to submit to an interrogation on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, with "the Swedish legislation itself allowing a videoconference call to be conducted, which could be carried out from Ecuador's Greater Lovys".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health could deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is in danger of getting worse because he is confined in a small space with no possibility of movement in the fresh air.
It would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that he had spoken with WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n is leading a series of proceedings in various European courts," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a leave tomorrow, it will all end."
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows, and as already done in other cases, the problem will be solved tomorrow.”
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and clarified that he certainly does not tolerate "understatement, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the corrupt and vilified politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, oppression and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, nor the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador, and that if he is re-elected, he will continue to make changes that are guided in the right way and in the right direction.
President Correa also backed the decision to keep Paraguay's veto of membership in the Unasur Union at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism enveloped in legality" because, in fact, it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also said he considered it "quite appropriate" that his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, wish to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time following a ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and there is an opportunity to move forward.”
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is being settled by the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek an international forum if both countries commit to accept a judgment, no matter how harsh."
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
"I have never been personally interested in much, but such unjust situations as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last term in office, and then I would be out of politics.
When we lose, the same thing happens to me.
I've already made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
“I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chavez has left for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the president’s state of health,” he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador today attended the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
Victims of AIDS are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his HIV-positive test was confirmed.
"It was as if a flash had struck me," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "lighten a little," but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from the family.
He decided to take his illness to his thighs and began to learn about it, with such dedication that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most recent patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut wound".
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate way is exactly the same as that of healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, the head of the Unit of HIV in the National
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of immune system impairment of patients who can be diagnosed with the disease for up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that the person diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can, according to these findings, "live up to 75 years without problems while adhering to treatment," the doctor explained in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is appropriate to recall that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has declined significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS, a percentage of patients have died according to national statistics 60.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and so far 187 this May. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?
“I don’t think there is a problem with access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens at the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted our drug supplies. The problem is that patients are coming at a very advanced stage, because they do not know the condition of the disease, that is, at the late stage of the disease."
It adds a persuasive statement: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already manifested. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to influence the overall mortality rate more is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore, on a large scale, it is necessary to offer personal tests to detect the disease".
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory only because he did it to his friend, and despite his low age, he was sick with an ulcer and he was sick with it.
"Everything will change if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather do it three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," lists Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to have a diet today as part of the World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they risked, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message sums up the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There’s a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who researches information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "condom delivery has actually increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most prone to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacies employees, and health care staff that teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this inefficient distribution, so that condoms would not just be behind the counters, but that the 100 would be in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not about promiscuity.
Nor is it about "paying them for beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex life," he said.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
In Mexico, the condition ranks fourth in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13th in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection occurs sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people per registered case who are not aware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognize the restructuring of the debt of Grupo Vitro established by bankruptcy in Mexico, sets a bad precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures of restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not seem to apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of Judge Harlin Hal’s judgment in a bankruptcy court in North Texas on June 15 leaves Mexican companies unprotected against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the verdict opens the door to Mexico’s top glass producer to the U.S. Supreme Court with an appeal against three inconsistencies.
In the introduction, it should be said that while the judge of this case argues that creditors are to be governed by the insolvency law of the United States, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings determine bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Business Law was created for this purpose, which is arbitrarily determined by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without a vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is allowed by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal Bankruptcy Institute has guaranteed domestic debt.
In addition, it is true that even after subtracting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. the funds of "supes", such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another perspective, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sady family company is appealing for a re-examination directly to the appellate court in order for the assessment to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since only three had originally voted.
If it fails here, it will demand as a remedy a review of the trial by higher instances, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
It is important that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae, which describes in detail Vitro’s procedure under the Bankruptcy Act and which points out that the company has relieved itself by acceding to a law signed by both countries.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules designed for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall assessment
Unnoticed, several months of criminal notices by Mexican aviation unions against former business owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, were lying on the table and, according to the pilots’ union, the container has already flown.
The case, led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which it accuses of obstructing justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which it collected 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company from Bank IXE of fideicom F/589.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens gathered on the weekend to approve the creation of the association, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge shopping and distribution center with products from the "big wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Canacintra (C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) has already managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental area that would partly devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the matter with the ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed in Japan the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano Pro la)
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect the short-term ones, the developer company Homex puts investment certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical series to offer interest repayment every 28 days.
Born Competitive
The merger of leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet led to the creation of an association with the trade name Competitive, which aims to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has toured the world with it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes had been involved in the sport for more than 60 years before he was struck by a wheelchair stroke in 2008, whether as a junior player, a BSN national basketball league player, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n team in the National Basketball League.
“I’ve played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and president of the federation,” Reyes recalled while visiting reporters at Primera Hora’s home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his assertion.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest movement of all guards, those who remember his work in Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, the one I enjoyed the most, because I have had the opportunity to participate with the team of Los Vaqueros since 1967 in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
Then the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here before and at the time at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, ‘I have a grown two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse to me, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if the Mincy brings Bayamon a championship victory, then Gauss will contribute to the next one."
The championship, when he played for the team of Los Vaqueros, he enjoyed, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy's placement in the national team.
“I remember the first time we defeated the United States in the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Championships in 1990, where we finished in the quarter, but we were supposed to have the bronze if not for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and scratched the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivase, Fica L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>na" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be with the team in 1990.
The team that may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, replacing the players excluded from the match at the Pan American Games at Mar de Plata, we have won gold despite all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved results like Piculin at this level.
Not to mention his performance in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your success in the federation to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you failed to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the boys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a man who acted recklessly and was mischievous and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died of cancer-related complications on Friday afternoon, according to a family announcement provided to the Associated Press by the Dallas-based production company Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved best," the family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death in a Dallas hospital," said agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest,” Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas show, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jinna) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to the top of the stars.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to evoke expectations about the emotionally charged part when Hangman's character is nearly murdered, not only caused a huge array of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risked millions of dollars in betting offices.
This also helped this piece to achieve a record in tracking.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history since the end of the 1983 series MASH, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. became pregnant, and he threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to have his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), an alcoholic, locked up in a treatment room.
“I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five parts of the second series have already been filmed and the sixth has just been filmed," the TV station said.
Immediately after Hangman’s death, there was no statement from Warner and TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classic plays such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Mai Axelsson, whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time lived in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew would hurt someone or hurt them in any way," he told the Prensa Asociado news agency.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
“I counsel them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "do not be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy".
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar to come on December 21, many people caught as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the “debt Armageddon,” and the growing conflict Israel is drawn into, the place where Christians theorize about the end of the world will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember that evil means good for the apocalyptic minded.
And it’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the latest in history.
At Temple University, expert assistant Barry Vacker organizes the course "The Means, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're sorting out why these ideas expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solario, an expert assistant in art history and anthropology, have come together to organize a course called the simple End of the World.
"We're not joining '2012' because we're always counting on the possibility of rescheduling the course in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite "threatening destruction", students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the very evening of the predicted end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It's extended to two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, who enrolled 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received an e-mail asking if there is still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a question of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour when it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no professed student, let alone a professor, has said he believes in the date of the end of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and in a way we are refuting them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that goes back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings by forecasting the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations has been caused by the Internet.
"Otherwise people don't think about it," he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knows about a course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines will not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception at the top.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the Last Judgment have been spoken of over the years, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several of them said they intended to go to the "end of the world" celebrations.
"I think I'm going to call a few friends to make us laugh together," said 20-year-old communications student Samir Ford.
