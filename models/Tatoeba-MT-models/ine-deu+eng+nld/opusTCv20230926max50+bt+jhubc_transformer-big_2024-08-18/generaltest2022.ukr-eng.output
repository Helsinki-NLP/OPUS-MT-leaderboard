In Kherson, people again went to the rally, the Russians did not manage to disperse
According to the agency, the participants of the event, the Khersons had time to hold a rally before they arrived at the site to disperse the military RF with the equipment.
“We managed to hold a rally. Now the RF equipment has arrived there,” one of the participants of the event said.
Previously, the citizens traditionally gathered at protests in Svoboda Square - near the ODA building and the regional council.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against participants in rallies and kidnap people.
On April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly conduct peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against the people, are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders are also kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title of "City Hero".
On February 24, President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of the war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the battles for eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces defeat there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
We fight, we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have dragged a large number of enemies on themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the OAS, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we're noticing.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us".
“People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to end,” he said.
On our terms, on the conditions of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied by any peace under any conditions.
But if we don’t talk emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, it all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight, but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the state study
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as such, where the metaphor plays the role of the axiological criterion

The dining room needs a code.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who were involved in the commission of war crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported on Facebook by the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of soldiers of 64 separate motor rifle brigades, who are directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine noted that for the crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will appear before the court and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of civilians killed were taken from the territory liberated from Russian invaders in the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out mass shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, jet-fire systems, ballistic missiles, air bombs.

place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great, I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal harassment of civilians north of Kyiv.
Photographs of captured and shot people have puzzled the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. It happens exactly what I was sadly waiting for...
I took children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces and I had no doubt that in the event of an occupation, the suburbs of Kiev would not spare my family.
Because I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten Communist-KGBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandparents was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago in the Zhytomyr SBU was allowed to take a copy of the shooting case of his grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more frightening.
The accused was illegitimate, denies the guilt.
Ethnic Pole, Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-court" noble, never walked in forts.
The fact that they lived in the pastures and had several cows was enough to sentence the feeder and feeder of young children to death.
The family did not even know about the burial site.
The grandmother said that nearly a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the surname of the knocker Shari.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree near, as you know, falls...
The firing squad, which condemned the peasants to death, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as the Immortal Barracks, which are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of the victims of Stalinist repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers – the system initially discredited and then destroyed.
As if on the computer found files with child pornography, for it was put in prison, and there he died quickly.
The KGBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why do you suddenly wonder about their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most disgusting features of human nature.
In addition to the thousand-year-old Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries were established.
And then over what came out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" of 1992, so it was.
You saw my picture in the bathing suit.
Can you ask my wife what can I buy from a cough?
Sorry, I have no one to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the children went, because Galya can not know them

The smell of cigarettes in the room is such that they smoke right here.
I'm asking you very much, one of them is barely standing, something is screaming, something he doesn't like. Very scary.

Yes, we took her home and drove her aunt right away.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it is possible there could still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm also very grateful to you.
I felt sorry for him.
In front of him, my best friend was killed.

As the “European truth” reports, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also offered howitzers in the version of the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks have to pick up relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will follow the circular scheme.
In the shortest possible time, the Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed by 2027.

True, they go to school so three because Galya and Sviatoslav are studying remotely graduating from school in Ukraine and will receive certificates of graduation already in autumn they need to go to universities
How to get to the city center?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are there.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do I have to go?
I like to listen to jazz.
Thanks I work with this application we talked about it in the Czech courses on Wednesday
For the past four years, I have allowed no one to come to me, read a lot of books on philosophy, and understood myself.

Is there any improvement in overcoming the coronavirus?
Thank you very much for helping people. If you can, help us too. Find cheap housing.
We are now in Slap, we were sheltered by friends for a while.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years, son 11 years.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist, a rehabilitationist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and I could work, we need housing near civilization.

Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even large stores would be closed.

I really want to be with you.
I want to make you happy.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know you're having a hard time.
But I treat it so that we're together. That we're a couple.
I would say that after the war there will be a lot of work to do.
I’m not afraid I won’t find her there.
I know a lot.
So I’m not afraid that I didn’t get into any of them.
I just don't know how it will be with housing.

Please tell us tomorrow for 5 guests to prepare an apartment.
The fifth place I understand in a room with a TV?
Fold and cover the sofa?
Can we stay with you until Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it
Not the new one you’ve used before, but it’s working but not needed.
Write the address in Czech,we will see on the map where it is from us
I don't know how much free space there is so I can't plan with the furniture I want this week finally look at that apartment and then understand what furniture I need

Only I'll be a little later - somewhere at 8. Can I?
I don’t want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
Because we didn’t even talk about it with these excursions!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I am silent about myself (for me this is just a peak that cannot be reached)!
How are you feeling today? After the celebration?
I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that yesterday Cole and I started translating the test badly.
I will ask whether Grigory Denisenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me with some mathematical concepts.
Can I be of any use to them?
If possible, I'd like to take a break from math this weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the track so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We hope for that too.
She is very happy with any gift.
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn’t stay away.
We have now agreed to be friends.
And last night I thanked God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
Branch in hall No29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
Don't worry, I'm a simple person.
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I didn't walk. Yes, I did. That's what I can do! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass shootings of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babin Yar.
I had the honour of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation – it is also part of our responsibility, linked to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “then for us Germans there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its blocked cities and causing them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that were not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak out against swastikas.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
There's a song for you tonight
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be assembled
All the sick only Lydia was not sick in them was an omicron a new kind of covid

Sergey Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favour.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine’s support for NATO membership and the assistance that NATO is providing in the context of the war, there is now much criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries – for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the skies, the reluctance to “treat” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European truth" we talk about how the Alliance helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance can be criticized by the guarantors, why our prospect of membership in NATO is close, as never before
What do you think here
I have a volt partner marked that my Statement is under consideration.
I used it through this mobile app.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had had a heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk to me and I felt sorry for him.
I have been supporting him psychologically for almost six months.
We talked a lot during that time.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
This is mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he asked me to get married, and two days later he died.
That is why God has decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks in Czech.
I wanted to say that I managed to find a home, and I am very happy <0xE2><0x98><0xBA> now I have a place to live and have a place to be with the baby.

I understand perfectly the price of unskilled work and I understand that such a job as I had at home in Kiev I will not be able to have here and the money that I earned at home, here now I will not also receive.
But I can't just sit back and do nothing, because then all the bad thoughts creep into my head, so I have to do something physical.

He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, do you have at least an approximate schedule of cleaning apartments for a month in advance, even for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember that schedule.)
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "previously did not do this"
Direct speech of Konashenkov: "We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army previously abstained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation troops into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozniak.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower at Dorogzhich near Babin Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defense over the South Railway Station.
On March 14, the wreckage of the downed missile of the occupants smashed the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential massif on Vinogradar, killing one person, wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall at Vinogradar, killing at least four people.
The mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who had been evacuated from the city, are yet to return early.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, on the outskirts of the capital, a lot of mines and unbroken ammunition.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning the first series of attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse the Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, near Belgorod, an oil base in Russia exploded, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that a "Ukrainian projectile" had fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in Washington and Berlin are throwing themselves in cold sweat from the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky on Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much with them as with their constituents and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to none of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, touch and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels oppose the acceleration of Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The money you raise is best given to people in need.

Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today, for some reason.

He's looking for the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
The children decide to stay at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now .... will agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got 50 bucks in my pocket.
A lot of people who are looking for managers, on our jobs did not give a salary.
Where do I go ?? Who do I need ? How do I provide children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... to drive you a thousand miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
And what next? I don't know. How much? I don't know. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from every iron - we do not have such.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children in danger, or to try to save ourselves here

These are bus drivers who today agree to ride in rubber trucks in temporarily occupied territories to bring help and take people away from there.
These are heroic leaders who go without fear to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peace stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid in wagons.
These are the gas stations that stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are communal workers who, under shelling, take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses, who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining, and in the free moment still volunteer, collecting pharmacies on the front.
In us in Ukraine, the juice stops when there are small leaves)
Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is that acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, a lot of people are in the visa center and do not work online queues.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far, a lot of time takes the road by train, the child will be difficult.
So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, we're fine.

Today I saw Christina's mom, but she didn't even say hello (
Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is it?
The head of the office of President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is beginning a "fake operation" regarding the weapons that are handed over to us by the allies.
“They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they want to “cut down” the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of the S-300 air defense system transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers give up arms from allies, and it massively goes to the arms of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such fakes.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the U.S.S. exclusively send the enemy to that world.
Excuse me, I forgot to ask how much boules are worth a kindergarten per month and will it work in the summer?
Everyone is given the strength.
There are a lot of sadder stories, believe me.

Thank you for your feedback and I wish you to find a good helper
Your father may have told me that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses among us, but I do not profess any religion.
He was baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all religions, the basis of which is love.
I read the Bible, the Koran, and started reading the Torah.
I believe that there is no mediator between man and God.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the appearance of evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these messages as a “provocation”.
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops are worth condemning,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a “violation of international law.”
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
"What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes are not left unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusation as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another depiction of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
The Investigative Committee of Russia on April 4 released a statement in which it announced an “investigation” on charges of Ukraine’s dissemination of “consciously false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing "genocide" in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” Zelensky said in a video address, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... For the shots in the back,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don’t understand,” he said of scenes of victims scattered in the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Liberty saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of apparently civilians.
Only in one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people at various locations in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilian form – were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to local residents, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from close range.
Ukrainian authorities said at least 410 civilians had been found in the Kiev area, which until last week had been controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told that there is no Kiev." How the occupiers of the underground exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another point, about which there is much less information at the moment – the removal of the local population to the enemy’s territory.
Since about mid-March, Russian occupiers have been "evacuating" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military base.
“Ukrainian truth” searched the Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same “evacuation” is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
Heroes of this text adhered to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from impasse.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took out the children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine from swimming Josip Zakhepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vala moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander himself got a job at the airport "Antonov", which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina had collected alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24, they did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own cars, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
Around 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw the helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first projectiles.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down into the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"At the 6th evening of February 24, people came into the entrance, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, “Is there anyone?” – I say yes. – “Get out!”.
They searched me and asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you on the instructions of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen OMON, not even troops, young boys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were assisted in the war by the Ukrainians, Sasko Byly (commanded by the unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have come to help you".
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that water, there was a big problem with it.
They smashed the store, took the goods from there under the guise of "everything Russians will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So they brought the sausage after the robbery of the store and said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovych."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a nice cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give up our phones,” they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and in general good: "Putin is a freak, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing, because there our families".
And mostly they did not fight, but drove to rob shops, looted.
Kurey was brought to them, one was tied to one leg of the Georgiev ribbon, and to the other – his white patch and called it "militia".
They came to Ukraine, they were not prepared at all.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... When they were beaten up in Bucha, so that they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have artillery?"
What’s more, we had detached troops – Chechens did not know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out, their own or someone else.
They were with us until March 13, after which came the Russian OMON, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from the "Byraktars".
But these came and told us that the U.S.S. is no longer there, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so many thousands 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian – either a landing officer or a FSB representative – came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Buch, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told, "You are taken to Belarus, and then, perhaps, to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "So have pity on the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either “Cities” or mortars.
And then flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Part did not go, saying that it is for traitors of the homeland – said, “you are shot there, to the organs sold”.
We were transported through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were greenhouses, broken equipment, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately exported the equipment to them.
Very many caponists, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed an improvised check, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, gave tea.
And here we hear the shots! The missile is firing, and it is visible – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, it's the planes flying, flying on the border."
But we in aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were put on a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonka" near Gomel.
Its head, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came, says: "Here I am, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves get to you.
The poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, so it will be.”
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And the people of the Red Cross and the UN delegation (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men can not go to Poland.
Many people believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we still decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate we were not helped, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one will take the bus.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers have been very helpful.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorts were carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
To our second group, a migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found a domestic carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who sat on the bus in Mozyr told that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the fields.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are liberated from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say, “You are a liar, we are a people of peace.”
They do not realize that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland were waiting for friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through the registration, decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as many as Estonian flags.”
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with the family of her brother – his wife and two children, 18 and 22.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to – the house is no longer.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
You can’t go anywhere on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything.We are always waiting for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, motiles are good

On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that on March 31, the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the occupants were evicted from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in a single Bucha, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back, some of the killed were minors.
Murdered and with traces of torture found the village elder Motizhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the fraternal tomb, Igor in the sewer.
On the side of the road, 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several undressed women were found wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
“All the equipment, everything they’re already shipping, for some types of equipment it’s done too late.
So what, when we are talking about Mariupol, when you are losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, there would be no such war, or it would look different.
"It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there would be no war anyway," he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I dream that the war is over and go home

He was a very rich man, but I liked him because I had my own point of view on life I met him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, after a while he called and reported that he had had heart surgery.
He just asked me to talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my backyard that looked like a crocodile, and I let my chest down.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and the radio' has been delayed because of the import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to throw the excess when calling."
"We've been hiding information about the war from my mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it succeeds.
However, in Plyamka (cat – UP) on the pussy and hind legs licked fur – it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The flag, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga hears badly and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived for a month in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"I lived with her in the apartment for 33 days as a partisan.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was nearby – formally came as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always close to the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
She hears badly – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
First of all, the receiver and the TV were hidden from her.
Then I called everyone who was communicating with her. It's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It's April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it. :)

A British man who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier who is a member of the naval brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will lay down arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aydin Ayslin, a British man who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Ayslin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Ayslin, who spoke with him
“It’s been 48 days, we’ve tried our best to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian forces.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you to everyone, I hope the war will end soon.”
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces, which is involved in the Mariupol defense operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of the soldier Anne Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son reported that they plan to surrender in captivity.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Ayslin said about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade ended ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted a friend of his, who said that Islin's unit intends to surrender to Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called "cadrivors".
Also on social media, an audio recording of a telephone conversation was circulated, in which Eislin allegedly talks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In a conversation, Eslin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
He was a social worker in the town of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to participate in the fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took an oath.
Aisle's friends and loved ones called him Johnny, and in social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada passed bill 7176, which has the title "Towards the monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of economy".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukraine’s national security in the economic sphere was the place where members of the Supervisory Board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decisions of the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but so far we do not know of any company that has had the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat posed by such a law is understandable – it is a great basis for “demolishing” all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans one malicious bill “flys”, then tomorrow others can fly – for example, you can abolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be said about war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of the draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will make our suggestions on how to solve the issue of management of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of supervisory board members to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the Supervisory Board for any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, as the law requires a competitive selection, which lasts on average 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed law 7176 decision is likely to not be able to save the supervisory board from the loss of the ability to make a decision, but rather will lead to it!
People's deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukh provides other arguments in support of him.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information".
For starters, there are almost no OPC state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is only in "Ukroboronprom", which in fact manages almost all state-owned enterprises of OPK.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not free of charge.
The entire power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the General Director, who will, by the way, make a decision on the need to relocate a certain enterprise of the OPK, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the OPC.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of state-owned companies and state-owned banks, but let's try to understand some of them: "respectable experts-foreigners at the first word "war" in Ukraine, in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time leave the members
First, it is manipulation – most of such members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also not be forgotten that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have a different occupation, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitry does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards, who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. With me 2 children.

We usually need an adult’s passport.
In Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce an increased commanding hour for 2 days.
Pavlyuk's direct speech: "In the settlements of the Brovarsky, Vyshhorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages restrictions will apply from 21:00 2 April to 06:00 5 April".
Details: According to the head of the regional government, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only take to the street during an alarm to go to the shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and demin the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the commanding hour will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

There is a translation word for word from that document in Czech.
Only at the bottom added an explanation of what is inkaso.

The Serbian defense budget has grown in geometric progression for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22th place in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took the prediction of possible aggravation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signalling system near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radyyo Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, who is quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, with the support of special forces of the "SOBR".
According to "Vasny", during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by law enforcement officers using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the BZD and an administrator of the BZD thematic resources in the VKontakte and the Odnoklassniki of Valentyn Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for the sabotage.
We will remind: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotages on the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
In this way, the Belarusian “reach guerrillas” are trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers, to fight, to Ukraine living force and equipment.

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia’s largest government-owned financial institution, and Alpha Bank is Russia’s largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as law and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new U.S. sanctions were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with these organizations and freeze any of their assets under U.S. jurisdiction.
The detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blockade of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-president and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mikhailovich.
Sanctions shut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

Good evening, I can not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for the son - alive and well.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensa, he conducts scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published in the morning of April 12, a video, which was transmitted to her by the military 36th brigade of the marines from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they did not have the weapons to take part in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "the bill goes for hours."
Before this, on April 11, the 36th separate brigade of the Marines, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi assured that the communication of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is there, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army applied chemical weapons over the plant "Azovskal", which is held by the fighters of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adjust for you. It would be very good

It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was going to do here.
The squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine from today onwards.
Nearly 50 professional helicopters will be used to detect, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invaders.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine the day before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasily Shchurom, delivered drones as intended: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities, where they are currently operating.
In order to use the copters as efficiently and safely as possible, the locations of their deployment will now be kept a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic to make a stop, say: already in the coming days will send to Ukraine many more interesting "gifts" that will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can and without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
I’ll be back in Ukraine soon, keep working.
All right. If it's all right, I'll agree
I'll try to do it myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write to you if I can.

But no harm destroyed houses, the harm of people who are abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupants mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that the unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photographs of the Heavenly Hundred and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.

She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko in the cribs behaved well.
On Monday I have to bring a confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the crib.
I've been lazy since Friday.
I don’t do anything just a lot of them and I sleep (and I drink a lot of water <0xE2><0x98><0x9D> <0xE2><0x98><0x9D> <0xE2><0x98><0x9F><0xE2><0x98><0xBB>)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I need to do another analysis.
So you don’t have to go again.
Very poorly working drain tank, poorly washes. Needs a master. Needs to be fixed.
That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have enrolled in.
Do you feed your children or do you need to bring them with you?
And now for a moment you can come to me there is one question
If you still need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the start, so people wouldn’t think we’re speculating on it!
But two points were not enough for me to fill online:
I will lie down to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
This is a great idea. Now I will watch the video. It will be good because the whole family will be drawing.
The University of Karazin urges employees and students to carefully check any information, do not trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on the official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
my other brother, who remained in Ukraine, also helps the army
I've collected some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How do I count the day that I was not at work is a pass
Headquarters building: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighboring state."
“It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state.”
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for actions in the Slobozhan direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being trained at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the recovery of personnel losses of units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motor rifle brigade (Borzya, Transbaikal region) 29 general army of the Eastern military district is carried out a set of military services.
A special problem the enemy feels when filling the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the delivery of goods to the sites of hostilities, will continue the strikes on transport infrastructure facilities on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or dismantling them.
Determined units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is ongoing in the Izyum direction.
To do this, the enemy uses the Orlan-10 UAV.
Forced to two battalion tactical groups the enemy tried to make an offensive in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenyke and Dmitrovka, had no success and left to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubyzhne, Nizhny Novgorod and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out the assault in the area of Zoloty, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupants continue storming operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of individual units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of settlements of Vysokopill, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past 24 hours have repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you want to sleep and I'll hold you
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand everything)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and especially 1+1. We do not need to adjust :)
I will turn on the TV here only to listen to the Czech language
I have a package rate for the month ends today :)
Can we do it on the phone today?
Buy embroidery fabric, canvas, embroidery threads
I understand, then I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so many cakes.
I'll meet my dad later, I'll be sure to check it out.
I read the announcement on Facebook ,so maybe Google wrote something on his own. ,I think the phone numbers are enough
Hello, we have the things you brought, but are there things that are small to us that you can bring in 10 minutes?
I've been thinking about work.
If the director agrees, I can start work next week because tomorrow before noon I plan to go to the labor office to submit documents (if it turns out, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I liked chemistry very much in school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work at Tev
Friends are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have come through difficult times.
Over the past month, I have been in contact with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from head to toe, like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilt and shame over the actions of your country towards your neighbors.
Because of why they sue Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkassov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
Let us tell you a little later, – as usual, Sasha replied laconically. – Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked at the Memorial, the New Newspaper, the Echo of Moscow, the Medusa, Navalny’s organization and a number of other places – have many of you done at least something to oppose this regime?
Except for taking part in rallies when they were still happening.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Late to hide, late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which have now probably been a great burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent – messy, even bloody, but real.
But the year 1991 was no better than the year 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally so afraid of the turmoil that you seek salvation behind the tsar’s back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think it's safer near him. Why?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans from the Stasi did, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lay down, update, reshape and seize power over the country.
When you were confronted with the choice between robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the possibility of the third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At the time, I was working in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation” and seeing with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Wow, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It’s your government that bombs one of your cities, it’s killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zero, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you began to earn well, some became wealthy, and even the poorest of you bought new housing and found a better job.
The price has gone up, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and shone from the chic.
When several opposition members were killed – Yuriy Szekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the case did not go ahead.
When, after two terms, Putin transferred the post of President Medvedev, and took the place of prime minister himself, you, I see, barely paid attention to this.
When, after several months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the outskirts of Kazbegi or in a cafe and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we did a lot in the West if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is screamingly violating international law when there is such a great temptation to Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again switched places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to mass protests.
The name Navalny became provocative, you did not walk out of the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he hit back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some of them have had huge deadlines.
“What could we have done?”
I have heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The country is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the pro-Russian president, who fooled their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan – and never left it again.
They built the tent town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, armor and Molotov cocktails.
In the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went into the attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The fugitive became Yanukovych, and the Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to independently choose leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
It was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but there was little benefit from it.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From where a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his mob, suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it hard to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We don’t care about politics,” he said.
And you’ve been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks like new since the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012 – with their bingos, public Wi-Fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and only becomes better.
You have barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book about Syria criticized it at the time in an interview, because I had no idea what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-blooded shooting at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Nimöller:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept silent – because I am not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything for my protection.”
How many of you have spoken of Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really speak now – such as, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into the new GULAG or form a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed – he will take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went to the protests and still took a small time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreement on social media (even if only a black square on Instagram) or have expressed disagreement in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given simply as a joke are not so distant in the past – and they are now, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of the Ukrainians – even more so than in 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his superiority is on paper.
All in all, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war is going on in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you maintain communication.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hokhma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no longer available, your economy is ruining faster than I am writing, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket to the airport.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try to leave or you’ll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is still one.
Which, in the end, will overthrow this regime.
And, perhaps, in the conditions that have arisen, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flare from you: due to the economic collapse approaching Russia, it will most likely burn in the provinces, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny’s organization has been defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized ones.
There are many of you, millions of you.
The Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If it comes out more than 300,000, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all that he made them in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a clear fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared of you, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son throws a joke in a computer game chat room – and will be arrested; your daughter expresses outrage online – and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw cell under police sticks.
That’s what’s been happening for many years – and it’s only going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Take action cold-bloodedly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday
We will be home in the evening.
You see me as a press secretary.
Vicky, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant for dinner?
Once in a while I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant

I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I was tired energetically.

But at night, a lady wrote to me, who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for new news from her and I'll definitely let her know.
When I worked at the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a difficult psychological, responsible, mental job in which I was completely disappointed.
It’s a pity that time is wasted, but it’s a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but I take homosexuality and marriage seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
So far, I haven't met anyone like that.
Good day. Where in the head can you buy molds for baking a belt(paper or silicone)?

Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to bother you during off-hours.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children were going home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valeriy yesterday opened our children's room for her until 7:00 p.m.
Could it really be?
Working hours of the room until 16:00.
In the end, it is our responsibility.

For now, I think this house in Prague 8 is the best option.
