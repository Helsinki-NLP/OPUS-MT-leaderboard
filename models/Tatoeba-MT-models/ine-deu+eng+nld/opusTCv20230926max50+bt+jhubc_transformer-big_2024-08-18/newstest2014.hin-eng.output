A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the highway system after it collapses, many people are looking for a solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on the dashboard of your car.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driven vehicle and communicates that information to the authorities, is now obsolete to fund the main roads of the United States. Washington and the State Planning Office are one to innovate a system of sewage sewage sewage.
Generally, the boring work of highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alliances.
Keeping track of the miles you have driven, and possibly the location you have driven – and then using this information to prepare the tax bill – to rally support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes. Librarians have met with environmental groups.
The tea party is hilarious.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned by raising various privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether further action should be taken, many states are not waiting.
They are figuring out how they can go into a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile determined on the road.
Thousands of motor-drivers have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is truly a must-have for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not to be chosen by us," says Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the Southern California government union, which plans to begin tracking every mile determined by motor-drivers in California by the year 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes made on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
The U.S. doesn't buy as much gas as it used to.
Now the car runs more miles in a gallon of gas than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians also refrain from raising a dollar in taxes.
Li Munikh, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, “Gas tax is not at all consignable.”
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, it will work as the most logical option," he says.
Wonks call it mileage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea is appealing to urban liberals, as it can, for example, alter taxes to change the way a car is driven, which can help to reduce slumps and reduce greenhouse gas.
California’s planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (AA-PA) also considers the Black Box to be the most viable long-term option.
The independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"""It's not just doing what's going to blind wells,"" Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region, said."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 graced Congress to move forward in the direction of per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year that included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to the city every day, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
Its most sought-after is Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the East Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers just a while ago, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says "There was a major concern about the Big Brother and other things of the same kind."
It’s not something that people want.
As the test progressed, Nevada's A.C.L.U. had warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology structure-structure, which every person had to necessarily spread to keep a record of coming and going every day.
Nevada is one of many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called Tru Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device that it is testing, the highway planners liked, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain interval of time.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they will be more willing to adopt this way,” said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of Tru Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes made in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are trying to give different-different options to drivers.
They can choose the device of GPS with or without GPS.
Or no one can choose to take the device again, but can choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing less and more convenience instead of the device.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop such a taxing device, which will also have the option of paying the parking meter fee for the car, the "pay-as-you-drive payment" of the car, and the real-time payment of the insured to the driver.
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it because of the benefits it derives from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on payment is a big distraction according to the mile.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that by increasing the Congress gas tax, the Bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund can deal with the problem very easily.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be imposed on hybrid or other car drivers whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their fair share.
"What is needed for him to have basic surgery when he can work with aspirin,"" said Randy Rentsheler, the Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to police, his death has been caused by drowning.
Albatta, a friend of hers, has been detained by the police on charges of hiding the belongings of the deceased.
The police have handed over the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of the Padshahi garden in Jhelum Sea.
Her relatives had accused her of murdering her friends as her mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that her phone was being used by a woman in the sun.
The woman said in the interrogation that the phone was given to her by a relative of hers, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in a paediatric garden and was a friend of the late Zahid.
On August 25, after prayer-e-jumma, Rouhail went to bathe in Jhelum with Zahid.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all his belongings on the side, while Ruhal went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, only his clothes.
Ruhail searched Zahid, but he did not find him.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his own use.
He didn't tell anyone that he was drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid's death was caused by drowning and was also confirmed in the postmortem.
Albatta, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 to conceal the facts and the belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly secretive manner.
The announcement was made by his family friend, Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
She met France's Balusconie when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
These are the same France, whose relationship was being said to have shown their relationship with Balruskoni.
A close friend of Berlusconi's and Banga-Bunga girl Martel Polanco has revealed that he was also invited to the intelligence wedding.
The ceremony has already taken place three weeks ago.
When Polanco was asked what would happen if the two were to get married, Polanco said in an announcement on Italian Radio 2 that they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place in a private chapel located in the house of the former Prime Minister.
Besides, no one can say anything.
However, she did not attend this wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman, was engaged to her 50-year-old.
In order to avoid squalor, Berlusconi had laid the foundation for loneliness behind his decision.
In the lower parts of the country, the rains continued to stop between the eyes of the sun.
With this, the cold wave has started in the entire plaint.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, -0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the state.
Meanwhile, Srinagar-Leh National Highway traffic has been shut down due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There has been a heavy snowfall on the Jojila Darreh.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activism of the Western eruption, only on Veerwar Tharke started a period of snowfall in the higher-privat areas of the plaintiff and rains in the lower areas, which continued till late evening.
The general public was also affected by the cold.
People stayed in their homes to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply in many areas has also been halted.
The maximum daytime temperature of Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius below the normal 4 degrees Celsius.
In Jammu, too, the nighttime temperature has risen due to heavy rains.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was recorded at 16.6 and the maximum at 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the Western eruption has begun to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, Director, Srinagar Meteorological Department, the weather in the plaintiff is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 1.
The Supreme Court on Friday once again disappointed Asaram in jail on charges of sexual harassment.
In the media coverage alleged by Asaram, he is being presented as a blood-drinking Dracula, but the court rejected his demand to ban the media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P Satshivam refused to order the media to keep Asaram from running news, saying they have seen every word reported in the media and no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to intervene in the case, saying they had more options.
Earlier, the court had once rejected the demand for a ban on media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the largest case of TDS theft to date.
The group manager of the mall then paid the TDS to the relevant financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
In doing so, the rupee of TDS was deposited by itself.
On October 17, the Mumbai-based inquest team had taken action with the Jaipur inquest team.
The same scrutiny revealed that the trader had cut the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday launched the Income Tax Survey on the group.
About 15 days ago, the threat of the account being sealed, raids and surveys were carried out on the group of the mall operator.
Angered by the action, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department right now.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
The investigating authorities in this case have clarified that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in the event of non-payment.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
In view of this, the sale of fake and counterfeit goods is increasing.
Sweeteners are also used to make chemicals that are shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake mava and chemical sweeteners.
The department seized 70,000 rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5,000 rupees from Queta Colony.
The demand for sweets in the market has also increased, as well as the demand for declining mave from Madhya Pradesh.
The information was received by the Nagpur Information Department to bring the looted Ghatiya Mave from Madhya Pradesh.
Nagpur is being transported from the transport garage to Mave.
The department took possession of the mauve at a price of Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not entitle anyone to Mave.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed (unannounced) property.
The department recovered about 5,000 candles by raiding the Jitendra Catters in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to brighten and last for longer periods of time.
A sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, co-commissioner of the department, said that chemically-based sweets and fake and fake candy will continue to be seized.
In the next few days, this campaign and acceleration has been given by the department.
The consumption of these sweeteners can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from Mave.
People have been urged to be vigilant against fake sweets and mayonnaise.
The state BJP's elected 42 senior leaders welcomed him to the airport in a strong manner.
It is worth noting that Modi has come to Bihar for a sympathy visit organised by the BJP.
The Santtana Yatra is an exercise in the BJP's ointment for the families of those killed in the explosions in Patna.
A total of seven bombings took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's rallies.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the explosions was to make a rift during the rally, so that more people were killed and an atmosphere of terror in the region.
The terrorists' intention was not successful, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyred by the BJP.
The leaders of the party have been on a journey from their village to Ashokkalsh since Thursday.
The bones of all of them will be transported together to Ganga in Patna on November 5.
As part of this journey, the consolation journey is organized.
The main character of the film is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. to meet their relatives.
He will also provide a cheque of Rs five-five to the relatives of the deceased during this gift-money.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already announced this financial aid.
The Indian team, excited by the dramatic win in the last match, will have to take over the series with the win on Saturday when they will come down to Australia in the seventh and final ODI at M Chinnaswamy Stadium.
India had recently won the Nagpur ODI to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs due to rain, and its batsmen gave it a record win, equating the team with 2-2 in the series.
Team India has scored more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again, it will be the responsibility of the batsmen to make a smooth crossing.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the big goal is also proving to be bullish in front of him.
While Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as the opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got a welcome pair that is facilitating the work of the rest of the batsmen from a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in the opening.
On the third number, Kohli is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar from what he has performed so far.
In fact, many cricket pandits have called him better than Sachin.
Next week, Virat Kohli has scored 17 ODIs, of which 16 have been won by India.
Pursuing the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but these three can also be detrimental to the highly reliant team.
Raina and Yuvraj were floping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a case, a good innings in Bengaluru ODI can work as a 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have been impressed by his performance.
He is also being asked to be in the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to the ninth-place finish.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogues and James Fawkner have done well in the series.
However, Phil Huenge and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
In bowling, Mitchell Johnson's shortfall could be huge for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home for Ashes series preparations.
Dr Jitendra Singh, a member of the BJP National Executive and Chief Spokesperson, said Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists in the wake of this apparent peace.
Referring to the intelligence agencies' reports, Singh said in a statement released here on Friday that Pakistan is putting a lot of emphasis on infiltrating up to 2,000 terrorists ready in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more perplexed after separatists have failed to make the situation worse by inciting people in Kashmir.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lieutenant General Zaheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahudin had convinced the terrorists in 2014
"Pakistan is committed to delivering on this promise with seriousness."""
Suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar and the killing of soldiers at the border are part of the same strategy.
Describing the demand for an end to the privileges of the army in the state as deadly, the BJP leader said it is also against the people to do such things until there is lasting peace in the state.
This leads to the emergence of anti-national elements.
He stressed that the army of the leaders should be stopped on statements that morale degrades the security forces.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US watch
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence informant, has announced that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Kitt Alexander, fail to respond about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stroh Bell, met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented by Mr. Snowden in front of the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government party - as a change - considers the disagreement, and does not offer any defense to the insidious apathetic who with the accusations of gonorrhea are the king.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said he believes that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include theft of government assets and intelligence.
Hans Peter Frederic, Germany's Minister of the Interior, told Online Zeit: "Mr. Snowden is getting ready to talk to German officials, so we'll have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims it has bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees the intelligence information. He said that if Mr. Snow Den had the opportunity to conjure up as a witness, he would have "completely destroyed relations with the United States and put it in jeopardy," even without putting them at risk.
Mr. Belle, a member of Germany's Green Party, posted a picture of herself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter feed.
He said he was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Belene said, according to a former NSA contractor's lawyer, Snowden is not able to return to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there which would require assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he had to face a "bizarre and sustained campaign" for him to leave his house.
However, he said the web is happy and overwhelmed by widespread responses "to its work of political expression."
World citizens as well as senior officials, including the United States, have hinted at the mystery of an irresponsible system of wide-ranging surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German officials "when the problems of the human condition have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carry-on Baggage Charges
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge $100 to carry luggage - on-store for passengers on its flight board.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said passengers could hold the entire box.
The new carry-on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said that $25 would charge if paid in advance, $100 would have to wait if passengers wait to pay while they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be earned to take care of the cargo in advance.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second checkbags in 2008.
Those who are trying to evade passenger charges are filling as much as they can in the carry-on luggage that is stuffed in the overhead box, which means there is often less space in this box.
There is a way to reduce the number of passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find an overhead bin's place.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to give $100 for an equal bag, while a passenger in the line at a front gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in processes are being changed to make sure passengers know about fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new Carrie - On Fees, will not start until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the air service likes them.
They argue that it costs money to handle luggage, and that those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Many are seeing baggage charges on Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even have a car-on-bag charge.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started Carrie-on-Charge three years ago for the first time, and partner Discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee is another airline, Hungary's Wizz Air, which the airline adviser J Sorensen said, and which the add-on will track on fees.
He said Spirit's Carry-On Charge brings in $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers at the gate to face a carry-on unusual bag fee.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it was lickety-split."
Frontier is also following the Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier necessitates that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire can, and this free coffee will only be given once.
It will still give away water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they withdrew and followed after any other major airline was there.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, then Frontier's move to charge charges on Carry-On is its latest effort to drive customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel sellers for each ticket sold between $10 and $25 of this type.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency, according to the report.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, several frequent flights began to be paid at half a mile away to customers who were purchased from an online travel agency from these individuals
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It is also that they allow only passengers to choose their seat in advance when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in their home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it's losing money.
The decline in revenue by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic Airlines are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale.
N.S.A. accused of "internal error" instead of hackers for website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical flaws, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
"Tonight, NSA.gov was not available for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-determined update,"" the intelligence agency said in a statement sent by email."
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that this obstacle, distributed denial of service [D.D.O.S.] came about as a result of the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that N.S.A.'s website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible to some users.
An N.S.A. spokesperson told A.B.C. News that there was "nothing at all" to deal with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is in jeopardy.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by the D.D.O.S. attack.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unconventional and the attacks are not intended to discriminate against the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious N.S.A., formerly known as the "No Such Agencies", has become the subject of much debate and criticism among the general public in recent months as a result of the occurrence of foreign and domestic spying programs.
Due to the soaring controversy over the agency, after the incident last night, speculations were made that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the story of 'One and Dronacharya', showing harmony in the duaper era and the present circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk in the wrong direction by straying into which bars.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Chhavani Parishad Vice-Chairman Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the hall of St Joseph Inter College.
The play depicted the commonality of the circumstances of the Dwarf Age Dronacharya and currently a professor Arvind.
Directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goel, Sema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc.
The play was designed by young colourist Jitendra C. Raj and set designer Hemant Kumar.
Various awards were given to the constellations that contributed literary, culturally on the part of Apta in the aftermath of its ceremony.
The meeting was attended by Dr Asalam Jamshedpuri, senior journalist Shanbhunath Shukla and colourist Jitendra C. Raj, chairperson of the Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivi.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Bombardier's profit declines as aircraft delivery, orders fall
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and as a result of lower order and delivery pressure on contract issues.
The Montréal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or present an update on the issues that will complete its ambitious program of going into commercial service from next September.
Almost one and a half months after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only been flown three times, raising the question whether the test stage is on track or not.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has sent for more than 8 percent sliding in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, has limited the stock's rating from "math" to "area performance" over the next one or two quarters.
"Weaker aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market programme will be suspicious.
Bombardier hopes the airline family can now cut it off at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Prospective buyers wait for the results of the flight test to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as the order for the CSeries is in the middle of 177.
A total of 403 orders and commitments are available with more than 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time it first brought the jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was going according to schedule.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground for a long time compared to the forecast," Boudoine said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the ground testing and software update interval of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer creates the schedule in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and an update period and said what we have done.
This is why everything will be done through the flight program.
The remainder of the five test aircraft are expected to fly in the coming weeks with the following shortly after, the company said
Still, analysts believe customers are suspecting they can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it has evaluated the service entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of the flight test - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - will confirm our view that service entry will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The company's revenue was $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues were expected to reach 10 per share cent and $4.56 billion.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that a year ago, below 57, 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but consumption of the following order and overall market situation were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenues fell by 13 per cent to US$2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, the division, had increased revenue by about 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogged at around $32.6 billion on September 30, up from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport department were also affected by execution issues.
The executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, in which Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pitchett announced the board's membership, also fell 8.5 percent to C$ 4.83 in mid-afternoon trades on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 per cent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication at the time of the morning.
They don't lie to anyone and don't think of stealing or cheating.
But when the evening comes, our minds change and we start to walk against the norm.
Researchers at Harvard University and the David Axes School of Business in Utah have given a number of interesting facts in this research.
According to the researchers, while we prefer moral values in the morning without the stress of work, honesty decreases due to fatigue or more pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point was higher on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they will be paid.
In this experiment it was observed that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning made no mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting on people between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately gave the wrong answer by keeping their tools in check.
As a result, researchers have been able to prove that the greed for money in the morning makes no difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving morality hints.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the robbers fled, waving their fingers.
The family has admitted the injured to the hospital in a serious condition.

Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, two bikers shot and wounded Jasvir, a resident of Ammanullapur.
Apart from them, the police have not been able to reveal many other recent cases.
Here, SO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents will be revealed soon.

Coca-Cola lawyer jailed for giving secret information to Mr. Bigg over police investigation
42-year-old Bashrat Detta informed notorious culprit Neil Scarboro
The lawyer thought that people might be aware of his secret addiction to narcotic drugs
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defence counsel, who told Mr. Big about the chief police investigation, because he was afraid people would find out about his secret addiction to his narcotics, has been jailed for three years.
After the 42-year-old Bartholomew Detta made a compromise due to his cocaine addiction, the notorious criminal Neil Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about his drug smuggling investigations.
This lawyer, who was given the nickname "Bash" and whose criminals were praised as the "Top Brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 following the police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he performed in the previous drug trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After receiving cocaine particles in Detta's hair, his wallets, and his credit card, the investigation found that Detta was a "regular user" of drugs of category A.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his accomplice.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merceseide, Berkeley and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people, who were sent to jail after being seized of over <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in heroin and cocaine priced at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million during several prints by the police.
The 42-year-old detta was providing information to the criminals because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Detta, who worked at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty of two counts of obstructing the course of justice in the Liverpool Crown Court after a trial lasting three weeks. He was found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice today
He had previously agreed to keep cocaine in the hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began at the time when while investigating Scarboro, the police learned that he had been in regular contact on the phone with Detta since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and saw him coming to Detta's house and holding more than 60 per cent pure narcotics under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the intoxication, Scarboro was in regular contact on the phone with Detta, who went out for dinner at the Blackhorn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found out that the drug had been placed there and there had been nine interactions between them.
The court heard that he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when he found traces of an A-category narcotic drug on Detta's hair, wallets and credit cards.
Detta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspicious dealer because he was her client and said her discussion was a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Detta pulled out his wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and a sample of his hair was taken.
In a police interview, he said he was running the office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients were calling at his home for legal cases.
After telling the main persons who were arrested what the spies knew about him, the court said in the hearing that Detta had been calling the chiefs of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously presented the case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal lawyer should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Detta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, too much of connecting with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal narcotic drug dealer, but rather about a dealer who is providing his lawyer with narcotic drugs.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his bounds of the lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the investigation of the police as much as possible so that they would be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He made a lot of connections to a certain client, especially to Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement to be negotiated with his own freedom.
Detta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I immediately do it.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr. Detta started getting narcotic drugs from organized criminals at the same time that he turned himself into a criminal from a criminal lawyer."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he compromised excessively and became much weaker towards the goals of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to the police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of sincerity, and fill people with trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid in his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Ditta, in which he was also found guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should act as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will search you and present you before the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Detta gave a question-and-answer session about himself, in which he said his fantasizing job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the US, to be a guest at Muhammad Ali's dinner, and to be inspiring to his work.
Kenya's press on controversial media law infuriated
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said, "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: what is there to prevent the freedom of the judiciary from being taken away by Parliament in the coming tomorrow?"
Managing Director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM, Cyrus Kamau, said: "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal "will always remain biased, as it is only part of the government" and said that banning subject matter and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to send the MPs back by rejecting this bill,"" he said."
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill would provide the government with "strict control over the media," while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had "been hit hard" and described the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of the jets sent to the attacking site, in which they showed them robbing the mall purposely, causing officials to get angry with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimyo had sent a summons to two journalists and a media person for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn by the media after the riots.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenya Shillings and 10 lakh Kenya Shillings can be fined on media companies and individual journalists, and, in addition to that, "removal from the list" or additional exemption from official press approval.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the infringer if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "One sentence is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
Politicians know by shutting down the media that they can do their will.
Describing the nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenai Media as the main source of control and balance in public life, writes "no one will ever know."
He wrote, "When the rulers are left behind, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and gatherings."
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the anger of people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and had restored about 532,000 shillings per month, the tax-free wage, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
The birth day of Mukesh Ambani, the world's richest Indian woman, is on a November one, but as soon as the clock struck on the night of October 30, 12 o'clock, the whole of Jodhpur began to ring from the birthday of Nita Ambani.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration had been entirely made by the performance of the team of AR Rahman.
In this musical night, which began at 8 p.m., Rahman presented his signature sangs.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage for the beautiful color of the dance.
Nearly 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests attending Ambani's birthday.
The charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW and Jugar, were requested.
Sood said that the cleaning system in the city, street light has completely failed.
No action is being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Hooda to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula be completely wiped out.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that the city has got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections, but they do not have the power to work.
As a result, the city council has become a dommi and the officials are working on their own terms.
Sood said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees, but all the money is being collected by depositing it as FDs in banks.
But no action is being taken to invest money in the development of the city.
VK Sood said the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the creation of dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in the ghastly cross sectors are forced to live narcissistic lives for the past several years.
Municipal Corporation officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in the village of Jhuriwala for the past several years, but people in the Barwala region are already experiencing two-fourths of a serious problem of flies.
"""The health services and education system in the villages have deteriorated,"" he said."
To date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in the rural area.
The U.N. has set new targets for tackling poverty.
The United Nations is about to immediately launch work on a new set of goals, which will take the place of the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the M.D.D. ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" just before the overnight Convenient Development Summit that began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to "raise above national interests."
"""I am very pleased that the member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for establishing a universal sustainable development goal,"" he said."
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our far-reaching goals of sustainable development based on the success of M.D.G.
The issue of security concerns in Mozambique grows as strong individuals clash with each other.
With a statue of President Samora, the founder of Mozambique, swirling down on them, thousands gathered in central Maputo for the cry of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about her country's future, she changed her corporate dress from "We Demand Security" to a printed T-shirt in Portuguese and joined the crowd of the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years since the start of a peace agreement.
Re Namo was once a notorious uprising backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and the South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe there is no chance of a return to the country's full-blown struggle, but recent events have upset foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, with some of the companies, including Eni, Rio Tinto, Brazil, discovering the vast offshore gas and coal reserves could bring in more than $50bn in investment next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975, has blamed each other for major political power, and Ray Namo tensions.
Rae Namo says the government launched the latest fighting on October 17 at Sofa La Province, traditionally a Rae Namo Fort, by launching attacks on its members
As the attacks on the former rebels escalated, government forces attacked the Renmo sites and told the Financial Times of an attempt to kill the group's leader, Fernando Mazang, Re Namo's spokesman, Afonso Dhaka Ma.
The government blames Ray Namo for the triggering of the clash, accusing him of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Jebuzaan has called for the country to address its concerns about instability.
Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whoever is left to try to prove to his armies that he can enforce his own decision on the government," he told AFP, a French news agency on Wednesday.
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mazhang was quoted as saying that the Re Namo Agreement was cancelled in 1992 but later became a matter of concern again.
He told FT that the agreement is not being honoured by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for compromise talks, but with seriousness," said Mr. Majangane.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to alleviate the tensions of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men (Jibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators, nor is it necessary that they are ready to make concessions.
Ray Namo, insisting on electoral reforms, had already spoken about the ouster of the municipal corporation elections in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an effort of a patient movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Ray Namo's participation in the polls has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member, was formed in which Mozambique's Democratic Movement (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majang says Mr. Zibuzanko - who has resigned at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mazhang said.
What kind of capability Ray Namo has has not clarified, but it is a major north-south highway on which he has made disturbing hit and run visits to police stations and vehicles.
Most of the conflicts are in the province of Mangai, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, which hosts the Bera Port which relies on mining, exporting coal, including to Rio Tinto and the valley.
Following the threat of attack on the Rey Namo line, the railway suspended its operation for almost a week in June.
Mr. Mahangvinit was almost questioned whether Mr. Namo would be able to duplicate this threat.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," Mr Mazhang said.
The government of instability has further heightened the turmoil, Fernando Lima, a media cop, says, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"People in the country are responsible for the future of the government and the president, and think he should be one to find solutions to problems," they say.
Omar Sultan, a protester, people still need stability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a way of life's author," myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "there is no match for all the subtle moves in the brute force," while Ecumenical legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths also teach "unprecedentedly far away and even in some cases it would not be appropriate to be taught in the wilderness and schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the "careful selections" of age appropriate functions.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myth and folklore is already a part of the field of education," he said.
I've been doing this as a plan for 20 years.
He has called writers and teachers "instructors" and it's a "new turn" for children, along with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Biowolf from Anglo Saxon as well as penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
For a child to possibly write an adult writer and an adult writer writing a big difference between an adult needs some meanings of hope.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a happy ending, because but it is a simple feeling of good and evil.
And said that the submission should be made, rather than what has been said was revealed through a story as compared to what has been said.
It doesn't show the old base.
Communication collaborator, Ghumarvi: Head constable Om Prakash retired after serving for 32 years in the police department in Ghumarvi.
On the occasion, the police department and officials organised the farewell party.
Om Prakash Panchayat is a resident of Bhaparal village.
He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that the New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: about a hundred years ago, funny comedian Frank Fah, who acted as the master of the sit-in ceremony at the Broadway. Seated by the sit-in, the people sitting in the crowd interacted.
Fee's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, designed and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Standup Institute called Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became very successful, to the point where they became too big to be played in the club," Hirsch says.
We created this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Vanda Siks, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes," "Stand Up for Others," "Stand Up for Heroes," "Stand Up for Heroes," "Stand Up for Heroes," and "Stand Up for Heroes."
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded as well.
Many of the comedians who participated in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as comedy shows like Comedy Central, F.X. and Spike.
Nick Crowe reached the leading position with the fanciful Ronchi Fantasy-Football theme "The League", Deep-Cable Sitcom (F.X.X.), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall The Shell With Shoes On."
Including Crowe and Slate, other young comedians with distinct voices (absolutely distinct from Anthony Jessellnick, a disillusioned, ethnically focused W. Kamaou Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be an interview: Talking to David Steinberg’s Larry David:
Steinberg had started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the D.N.A. of all Larry's works,"" Steinberg said."
They were telling me that, when they are here, sometimes they go down the alley between the two buildings and they thought to themselves that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 per bbl
A report that has raised concerns about more supplies such as oil prices is off-putting as China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
Benchmark U.S. crude New York Mercantile Exchange for December delivery was down 14 cents on electronic trading in Europe by late morning at $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell 5.8 per cent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
The price of enough crude oil supply has been on the scale in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
More than five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand has led to an upsurge in activity that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come out on Friday.
This shows that Kivikas could continue to strengthen China's economic reform after falling 7.8 percent commitment in the last quarter in a two-decade to the third quarter.
Brent Crude also used by U.S. refiners as a benchmark for international crude oil, falling $ 108.58 per barrel from 26 cents on the ICE exchange in London.
The court has barred action on the New York Police Department's hiatus and sport policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case, requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and play program.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2nd And Judge Shira Shindeler has said the judgments will be adjourned as a result of an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that it violated the Constitution in order to prevent people from interrogating and questioning people in the city.
The city's police department has also included a decision to allocate a surveillance to help its policy and the associated training program change, its findings and its remedial order appealed.
The Appellate Court heard the pleadings on the request journey on Tuesday.
The Appellate Court has held that because he made a requirement for a judge to avoid bias in the presence of partisanship in a series of media interviews and for the public to disobey the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, the Court of Appeals must, therefore, disobey the Judicial Case.
The judge ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and sports program.
She has appointed an outdoor monitor to oversee major changes in policies, training, and supervision, including economic reforms, and she has been the most off where she has ordered a pilot program to test body-wearing cameras in some premises.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the City is scheduled for some time after 14th March 2014.
Retirement and sporting equipment has been criticised with civil rights lawyers.
The rest and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but from mostly black and Hispanic men, the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration has dramatically deterred the rise from 684330 to a all-time high in 2011.
A trial of four men was filed by all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD's break and change in sports program have said that an end to unfair behavior will have to form an even more credible and effective police force and could affect the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money wasted and not over the past decade, will solve a wide-ranging problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officials.
The judge has noted that the pause and play did not end, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
Participants from Godda, Pakud, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of a number of disciplines including tent pitching, flag poles.
The training is being carried out in cooperation with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are sharing a sense of unity by joining in prayer.
The State Training Commissioner of the camp, Vipin Kumar, is providing his special assistance.
Callson Uses Phone Hacking to Confirm Confidential Information
Andy Callson, the former editor of News of the World, has been accused of having made a so-called "secret call" in an attempt to confirm "phone hacking, nigga" about his sexual relations while he was home secretary to Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper had hired private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack into Paulby's voicemail and "keep watch" on the man, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said that "the suggestion of the prosecution is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside the people's house and watch them, but rather to keep the articles in front of the people, to see what people react to him."
He said that the N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third group consisted of the editors themselves.
It is obvious that he knew about other ways, i.e. nigarni, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew absolutely."
The rumor about Clarke's promiscuous relationships was first presented by the feature desk of A.O.T.W. at the time when a source sexually aroused in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From Mulker's home in August 2006, a voicemail tape of Ms. Polby's phone was seized at least three times.
Investigators also found such entries in the private investigator's computer, on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named the "project."
During the period during which they were being investigated, Ms. Polby's grandparents were called by phone and asked for information about them.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Navili Thurlabeck and former Reporter James Wederup watched Ms. Polby's arrival and departure.
On June 18, 2005, Callson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that the involvement of the call in the case is only in the parten with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blanket about the prenuptial relations with a married woman while at the time he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to engage with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted the phone hacking.
Promote corporate fear through the NSA’s disclosure about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter hovered over the U.S. Embassy in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US court, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundisbank.
The German media asked the BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the lysing antenna and signalled an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. National Intelligence, emphasized that the U.S. "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and not push U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or re-increase their bottom line."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who's made the Whistleblower, began telling the treasure trove of his secrets to American surveillance, European government and trade leaders are no longer sure the directors aren't going to keep their promises.
The U.S. National Security Agency has spied on Brazil's oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo have expressed fears about surveillance of the Empire.
The last thing came when it became known that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful people can be targeted, certainly the leaders of the trade world are also potentially targeting.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for these data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German small and medium-sized IT companies.
According to a survey published by the consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost now become a big risk like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all the records, however, there is so far no evidence that the U.S. has gone to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. And it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the trade world are doubtful about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Planner, chairman of German business software company SAP, said "it's no way."
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then he would not have had to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional. From coal, cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations by Snowden about U.S. technical refinement and spying access have proven to be a blow to some companies that were previously believed to be China's biggest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing industry where European officials are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is under that jurisdiction and has therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after disclosure about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come up with a year ago – that’s – my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most innumerable secrets and data and therefore have to be wary of them at all costs.
It's no surprise that economics is being spied on.
It has always happened.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The U.S. is spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are too, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally unwilling about the defense system and this is an advantage for the assailant.
For large companies, the message record has been going on for a long time whether it’s a failure to leave a business from home with a USB stick, or a laptop failure to leave in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of automakers Audi, says it is a century-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to risk on overseas tours.
The prepaid mobile phone was later discarded.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, it is the number one company in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often have a lack of experience, to effectively protect corporate secrecy against unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources," warns the BfV in a report.
The U.S. has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of the US National Intelligence in February was named in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking, after Russia and Israel, which followed China's economic information.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "Services know very well that all countries, even if they join in the non-terrorist fight, spy on their allies."
The U.S. is spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are too, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one has become a fool.
Georgia's teenage parents who were killed in a 'single accident' believe their son was killed
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat in his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, G.A., was found stranded in a straight-up mat behind the blisters inside his high school gym on January 11.
The London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a "unique accident," but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Attorney Benjamin Cramp, who introduced Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson to Fox News, told Dotcom, "He fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He is not at all confident about death in the manner told to him by the sheriff.
"He believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and common sense,"" Cramp said."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Muller said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Mure said the matter at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring out the truth.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation,"" he said."
Moore told the reporter that the initial body test showed signs that Johnson's death was due to "sustainable respiratory arrest."
According to Moore, by the way, a different cause of death was discovered in a second body test."
"There are many questions that need to be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to impeach a criminal in Johnson's death case or to investigate civil rights, he will ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the Landing County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, a judge in South Georgia ordered officials to release all the surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some indications of how he died.
C.D.C. Issues Guidelines on Allergy to Children for Schools
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday issued guidelines to control the food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of children going to school suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now, one in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that food allergy cases in children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline provides information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of apnephrine to cope with potentially lethargic acute haemorrhage (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the APPEN brand most commonly used.
The state legislature has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep more stock of apnephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be communicated by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "Something seems to be chewing on my tongue," "Something seems to have hair on my tongue," or "Something is going on in my tongue."
Parents of intersex kids can choose their children’s ‘gender indefinitely’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third sex for children born with an obscure genitalia.
Newborn babies will no longer be specified as male or female in a conventional manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender ‘unspecified’ or ‘unspecified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can take sex-determination decisions for newborn children in the fast-track, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex man had said years later, "Neither am I a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be injured, bruised and crippled by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children per year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the examination of sexual development disorders, it is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (ovarian or ovarian), or abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Wallis Simpson is intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood correctly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best available information to specify gender when there can be no gender determination and to develop and develop a healthy and healthy lifestyle, if such a situation arises,
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender-identification cases, said Germany's new law "looks like a good thing."
Intersex children create moral insensitivity.
"Some people are in life-threatening conditions that require epilepsy, but most children do not,"" he said."
You can specify the gender only without a pediatrician, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sex is not very accurate.
No one can give an honest answer as to why this is happening.
It’s kind of a puzzle as to why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is neither gender-related nor gender-related, but both gender-related and gender-related.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual attributes, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sexual attributes such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-formal genders.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark adults on their official documents as males, females or "third genders."
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal to maintain "unspecified" sex status to life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have a third specification as an X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighbouring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country signed the petition to withdraw "sex doctrine" from the school's books.
The U.S. Catholic online website has also opposed the German law, saying, "While the world is going into a state where gender is a self-chosen option, but not a sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization" in the opposite direction.
The mother of the newborn baby in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would like to see the babies given gender at birth.
He said on the website about Parvish, "Parvishing is very stressful without extra limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and reassurance.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called harmafrodits (obaylingi), which was in the name of the beautiful Greek deity who were twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the morality of psychiatry, they are realizing that sex-identification is a complex job, and sometimes even doctors can make mistakes, who do not know what their gender specification will feel like when they grow up.
Dresser says "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a 'psycho-emergency'.
When these babies were born, you didn’t call the psychiater, you called the psychiater.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vague genitalia was presented by Dr. John Hapkins of the University of Minnesota, who considered the sex to be virtuous.
He coined the word "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents favor a child - determine by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a case of the year 1966, known as "John/Joan," their theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had been accidentally sexed during the lingual surgery (surgery) to remove the ovaries by completely binding the child and make it look like a baby girl.
"Moni presented the case as a successful case of staging, but it did not happen,"" Dresser said."
At the age of 15, the child changed back to being a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the post-1990s, individuals who went through these gender-sensitive treatments began to emerge “not happy with the outcome.”
The same case was with the 36-year-old author of Montana, Jim Bruce, who was born with an X.Y. male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his bhagshef was large, but they were sure that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
Therefore, only a short time after her birth in 1976, the outer limbs of Bruce and the ovaries were removed by scabies-medicine and her parrot was made like a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, he asked for medical records, and he said, “I’m sorry.”
This made him aware of the terrible truth.
I was tied up at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took a dose of testosterone and removed his breasts.
Because of his medical condition, he became pregnant.
Today, he explains to people in an organization called the Interface Project to make their perceptions about intersex individuals normal.
But, Annie Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites silence and shame."
"Many activists think that Germany's law will motivate parents to make quick decisions and designate the child 'unspecified'," she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that, rather than waiting, specifying the male or female sex is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Timer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
"""Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex,"" he said."
The law of Germany is concerned with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborn babies at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist Dr. Erlen Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder and who supports hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give strength to both parents and children."
Baratzi's daughter Cathy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.S.D. called full-androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen was flawed in the body, female impulses developed in Cathy.
There is a vagina in her body but there is no uterus or vagina.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resides in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother either through adoption or through gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to make it easy for them not to make any decisions on their own in a hurry,"" Baratz said."
It gives them, before writing, time and understanding by some trial in a proper way.
This way, you stay well - respect the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and have fun with it.
We don't need to rush to do a sciatica that can't be reversed.
"""It brings children into the decision-making process and frees them from the anxieties that motivate parents because they don't believe they are recovering."
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with -- and that will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The Tehsil Legal Services Committee held a Legal Awareness Camp at the Middle School Dalai Lama in Ramnagar, chaired by the chairman of the committee and all judges of Ramnagar, Sandeep Kaur.
In which the students and other people were informed of the law for the rights of education and the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch informed the people in the camp on the said issue.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Consideration of Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton as Biden's replacement for the post of Vice President for the year 2012.
The most notable explosion in mystery is the massively anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Alperin and John Halemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and on Thursday evening reported that Obama's dumping bids could help to find out what Obama's fall in hopes of re-election held "wide group meetings and polling in late 2011" to top advisers.
According to the Times National Political Journalist Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information on the efforts of the chief officers in the campaign and put in the White House, the chief bill of the former White House staff, to name it, to find out what the former secretary of the state has to do with Clinton's vice-presidency.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago Campaign's infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisors – including Dil, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisors David Axlerrod and David Palouffa – were aware of the change under consideration.
"Double-down" claims that Mr. Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal resolve, before finally deciding when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's condition.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I looked at the whole scene, and one of them, it was," he told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy at that time, we were in such a state, "Holy Christ, what else shall we do?"
While Dale described the research as "precautionary," Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign had again invested heavily in finding out how much dividend this claim would give Pole.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focus groups like money until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked the cast if their boss knew about the possible change.
While Dale said he "didn't think the president knew about the potential change," the former chief of staff felt it was "possible" that it was known to Obama.
"Double-down" sure: Will not answer whether the political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about Biden's dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
What do you think? - In-Dark Ice Cream.
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animal to develop the finest breakfast.
She came up with the idea after reading a research paper on Jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-shine the protein.
Ice cream, eaters who react with the tongue will increase the pH of the protein and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is brightened with the heat of the mouth reacting, that is, the more you lick, the more it will be brightened.
"This is an incredible thing, but the production of the early days will get me about <0xC2><0xA3>200 from 2 grams of goods," said Charlie, founder of the I.M. Delicious Ice Cream Company.
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We’ve been experimenting for the past few months and it feels just right to share it on Halloween because it gives an amazing glow effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I have ever made because the brightness of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each shop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, the taste is very good.
Apne is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf, based experimental company in Charlie's Bristol.
But his next composition is going to be even more ambitious.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream," he said.
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make the refraction above the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a reflective property of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market in the Rani Bagh market was disrupted by customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
Recently, Vazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar Central Market were also present.
Similar sightings were also found at the Surafa shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
The people also bought gold and silver jewels and coins in abundance.
As a result, other markets, including the outer ring road, were also booming.
However, people leaving the office for home had to spend hours in a jam to get home.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighbors.
Today, I've become more than a greedy
I haven't signed in to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and probably won't be this year.
But the figures show that there is a black sheep when the moose comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween at $158 million this time, spending $6.9 billion on candy and clothing and decorations.
One of the things I've always seen in the past is the hallmarks of Halloween.
According to the NRF, the total cost of clothing is estimated at $6.9 billion from $1.2 billion
This year, all of them are angry at the non-violence.
Women don't have to do vaisyavriti; because she is also a sexy eater of pizzas, hamburgers and carrots
I hope for the man there are a lot of zombies, and thanks to Mordo, our Instagram feeds will be created for the nasty space men this year.
According to Google, the most-searched dresses will be zombies, batsmen, looters and swindlers.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year, we dressed the dogs and, surprisingly, we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million on pet clothes.
This is the joke that there are a lot of hatdogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to the Nielsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Heirshi Bars, Lollipop, Milk Duds, Twistlers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million trucks to trucks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candycorn, but it will also sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about $9 billion of maize's personal stubble.
It is a mystery. So far to solve
There's nothing more basic than a Halloween ghostly house.
They're best-known, "the terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "shout-o-shout" and were like "House of Shock."
According to the American authorities, in fact, there are 1200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And that is the terrible good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes you and makes you smile.
Finally, let's talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
For us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" was due to the Pintarest that started last year, so most of us mapped out these guards growing up and didn't live with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. will spend around $106 million on pumpkins this year.
The slow-mooring jack-o-lantern on his front porch may have been from Illinois, which this year exceeded 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you’re looking for extra loans, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin in the measurements of phone Tim and Susan Matisdas, Calif., and above.
"""It was decided to issue a postage stamp containing a picture of Sachin during the pre-match presentation,"" the MCA said in a statement."
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be held by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page bulletin containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements by people from the business, sports and journalistic world.
The limited number of coins will be distributed to the MCA and BCCI members, the union said.
He said that every day 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats will be distributed including photos of Sachin.

The idea of doing business in the Patakha market at Transport Area was not realized by the Patakha traders.
The fireworks dealers have been trapped in the mezzar after the order of the High Court.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary bulletin board market created in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for trade in the transport area.
A commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary bulletin market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs 10 lakh for lack of proper management.
The High Court, in its order, vehemently rebuked Amritsar's administrative officials, saying that the administration had not been able to solve a difficult task for the shell traders for nine years.
They could not be made available in the proper place in the city.
Subsequently, appropriate security management and fireworks dealers were asked to issue licenses for business only in the shipyard market.
After this order, even the shell merchants were happy, but on their happiness, the police turned the water back on Friday.
A team of the real license branch of the police reached the Patakha market and sold the farm by setting up a counter there.
After that, it was impossible to fulfill the conditions they were told in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharge of Realha Licensing Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached Patakha Market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the shell traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to the shell traders.
Diwali has one day left.
As a result, the merchants are troubled.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Patakha traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said if they lost crores of rupees, they would sue the district administration.
Angry shell traders on Friday night took out the angry march from the shipyard to Ranjit Avenue.
The police and the district administration have rallied.
After this, Ranjit also closed its business in the ongoing temporary Patakha market in Ranjit Avenue.
The fire brigade was summoned to rescue a lost poppy on the face of a mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after coming into a small road collision
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After being somehow trapped on the face of a troubled mountain 50 feet above the ground by the Papi, he got a happy life by summoning firefighters.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denham, Ruby, were at the Flappy Mine in Paschmice Yorkshire to meet again, and he has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, after his escape, he had searched like crazy for his lost dog, and an appeal had been posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, on the mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team arrived at the scene from Clackheaton Fire Station and took down the rope to rescue Ruby and used a belly tube to bring him down from the rock.
Andy Claten, an expert in technical rescue, said: “He was in a dire situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet up and down.
He did not do a single deed during the defence, she remained stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she ate biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's unbelievable to see a dog.
Special technical defence officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is saved in a fortunate way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in even worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where he was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
I had no idea how she got there.
It's amazing to have him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she got very tired and fell down, she would definitely fall down.
The fire department did a great job.
What he has done is a very courageous work.
We were all very good and they were all very good.
From Kegley, Mr. Alderson also said: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire department has done a great job.
I can’t believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Cathy Perry was 18, she didn't hit him
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said that he had dinner with senior rocker, and when I was 18, he hit me.
"This thing has become old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old's representative said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly refuses to ever strike Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Pari is talking about him in the misunderstanding of someone else."
Parry was one of the singers who came as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Kerevan: The disintegration of the Euro gave the Scots the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of EU membership, an independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area across Europe.
The Passport Control on the Barvik and the Hadrian's walls indicate stories about the constriction of the wire on the walls.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Neither did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as they need to.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shaneen area, Brussels will be a low-cost discount for Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, again, a story.
And the thing that's been stuck for so long, it's stuck. First of all, I heard the unfounded news of "freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point in retelling this interesting old story was lost.
Why should we expect to bid to Europe from an independent Scotland anyway?
Why buy-sell London's Yokohama to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project in Europe has officially died out.
Dedicated teams across the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or shut down the euro as an equal currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany Party - which has just been established this year - abruptly came and got about fifty million votes in the September federal elections, and thus got away with the Free Democrats (together with our Liberation Movement).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be volatile.
Along with the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that the project has gone a long way because of the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The excessive budget deficit of national governments did not play much of the role of the euro crisis - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system has stabilized its members' currency exchange rates in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency depreciation, Southern Europe finds itself in a position of underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Europe's productivity is far ahead of the current budget and currency problems.
In order to provide exemptions to French and German energy companies on consumer spending - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European industry doubles the cost of electricity and four times the cost of gas compared to the United Nations.
This is a cost-cutting loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even to freeze all wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, a sense of rebellion has been stirring in people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the judiciary, France's top politicians saw the EU as a means of keeping Germany under control, and of providing Paris with the equivalent of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to falter.
The result: Marine Lee Penn's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the by-election by pushing the ruling socialist to third place.
The front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume that disintegration for the left, self-benefiting for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound fame in the middle of the working class?
The party wants to make use of next year's EU elections in the European Parliament to form anti-EU, anti-currency factions.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then such a group could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: Soon the anti-EU and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will eradicate the euro.
The euro will not be completely ended, but it will come back in a form such as "(the sovereign) Europe of nations" that will be supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its neighbouring economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect that the U.K. will keep itself away from this project in the hopes of increasing proximity with the U.S.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland in the aftermath of this?
We can choose to remain the territory of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do a better job in a free European system, provided that we keep our own currency.
It will be easier to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe of non-federal nations.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic freedom while on the road to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-poverty political campaign in Europe, which was proposed by Labour's Chancellor Alistair Darling to oppose (as implemented) the cuts in the bailouts of the year 2011
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, as in that situation it would have to accept the rules of taxation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Childhood: Growing Up Fast
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get to be teenagers at a younger age than girls of their own age.
Physical change does not mean that the adolescent is close to
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that varicose veins can be a cause of adolescence at a younger age
The case of premature youth is not as effective in boys
Pat Ethryz, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years old and having genital hair?
This week at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz clarified that these initial physical changes are common among American girls, not
"I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence - that it usually doesn't reflect the rapid progress towards full youth," says Caplovitz.
Direct signs of development such as germination of breasts, genital and ear hair and physical odor are seen in girls ahead of time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of rhododarsan (the first monthly-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first rheumatism to develop," explains Caplovitz, who "time-premature adolescence in girls: a necessary guide to dealing with this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
What is the beginning of adolescence is debated, but when breast growth occurs before the age of 8 two call it "baby-adult."
In most cases, the procedure will be slowed down or stopped - which can be closely monitored by the pediatrician.
In the event of more rapid progress, an examination by an endocrinologist may be necessary to eliminate the chances of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments to delay time-premature menstruation and other consequences are: time-premature age-growth of the bones, which can lead to unsteady growth and rapid growth as an adult.
Compositions for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, "Prepressing young people can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel different from their peers."
Another big problem can be understood: Parents just don’t want their underage daughter to have a monthly religion.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain sanitation,"" Caplovitz said."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we had also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and saddened that she had first started monthly religion in her classmates.
There are a lot of common theories about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones, chemicals or sexually explicit messages in the environment or the media can be blamed in milk or other foodstuffs.
Boys - like girls - are getting pre-teens as well.
Caplivities determine the rule that its main cause is the outbreak of turmoil.
He helped run the study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which adds body fat to adolescence.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get teenage before their age-old blonde girls.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of pre-adolescents, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a younger age, the course of adolescence in them is not as clear as in girls.
Other physicians who attended the A.A.P. conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see muhanse and genital hair.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatrician anddocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about this. We need to be careful about how we really start adolescence."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their children to take an opinion on this.
Caplovitz advised, "This means that you may have to negotiate ahead of the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be reassured that even if it is happening prematurely but it is part of normal life.
On Friday, the temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
The rains and cold winds on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Friday, people wore sweaters and went out to their markets and destinations.
After the first rain of the winter, people have also taken out Rajai.
In the morning, people were watching the sunrise.
As the weather changes, the ailment will also get a lot of relief, but after that, the cloud cover continued to develop throughout the day.
The children also came to their school wearing sweaters.
According to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature on Friday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimetres of rain were recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, there will be further cloud cover in the sky.
Large orders of jet manufacturers bet on the seat width by dispute.
Setting the tone for this month's Dubai Aeroshow, a rift has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights
The dispute is centered on the width of the economy class seat on long-haul aircraft, not always as given by airlines such as Airbus but whose allocated space efficiency has been claimed to be key by the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus expects such an industry standard to be set at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the Economy Cabin this week but it should be decided by the airlines, according to its main rival Boeing.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes when the twin engine versions of the long-distance aircraft, which were registered after the event of 17-21, started to sell off after a possible order was filed.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been built--especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 being designed with the claim of more capacity being taken into account the mini jumbo jets?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" that will put 406 people in a 17-inch wide and 10 logos in a row in the e-commerce department.
Airbus says it will take 350 people to an 18-inch, 9-equivalent seat while battling the A350.
Aircraft giants often invade trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X, more than 100 orders are expected to be delivered at Dubai Aeroshow, the public is further appealing.
Recently it is being seen that the outbreak of the war has been anything but showing Finchero this together in a restaurant, will you accept it together?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said, "The Boeing Regional Turbo is also offering long-haul flights in cruises."
As a change, people are getting better, but the way the plane sits hasn’t changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, the average 40-49-year-old American male's weight increased by 10 percent between the 1970s when the Boeing 747-Jumbo ne defined modern long-term ki-travel.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival has stuck to a 1950s seat concept when the new name "Jet Set" was the average circumference bracket.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an extra inch in seat width to improve the quality of 53 per cent of sleep.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement figures, and has said it does not depend on the manufacturers' decision as to how airlines strike a balance between fares and amenities.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing Cabin Expert Kent Crower said: "It really tells airlines what to do to provide flexibility and trust in the things they need to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us who they are benefiting from."
They know their business better than anyone else's.
It’s about the elbow room for flyers, but for suppliers it’s quickly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion, enough for the competition of the aircraft order to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports in the coming decades.
For the first time in July, Reuters reported, whether the seat layout is really a fight between the new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that the seat was 20 per cent operational per seat in their new twin engine design, the leader of that segment, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the 10th 777 X One original 9 compared to the 777 design.
The unit cost has now been used to compare 10 equal to the profit.
Kevin Kenniston, head of Europe’s Airbus passenger facility, says “Boing’s aircraft is doing it to make our products, along with making them more competitive and occupy more seats.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin is a suggestion for the existing 777 S that many passengers are in favour of the danser layout, which can also go along with cheap rentals.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus's business is driven by the threat of a point of sale proposal 777,"" said cabin interior expert My Carbi, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network."
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for the airlines.
Jet sellers from all over the world also take precautions to check on this layouts competition.
While relaxing more, all builders are also offering low-cost jet aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equivalent A350 but says it hasn't been sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus emphasized the extensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facilities.
It is unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, but it can deviate from the 777 X sales wave.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May End Smoking Pleasures
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep the rats safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
There is a need for further testing before testing on humans can begin, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornel Medical College in New York said the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornel said that "we very much hope that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market today, using the more sophisticated methods that they have used to quit smoking, but they
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively, infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies after it.
Antibodies look for any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent them from rising inside the smoker's mucus by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the rats that were given the vaccine, which were later given the nicotine, continued their normal activity.
The researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine “looked good,” it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies in them.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals in order to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before the cravings of trying cigarettes, which could save them from nicotine addiction.
But probably it will be used to quit smoking by people who smoked it.
"They'll find out that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists called the result interesting, but warned of the need for much more research to be done.
Even after the postmortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual cause of death of the tigers.
The Forest Department, in a roundabout response to this, is firstly describing the death of Tiger as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division had found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Congeration Reserve Kichdi River.
While all the bodies of the tigers were safe, there were no marks of injury or injury, etc.
In the presence of forest conservationist Vivek Pandey, CTR deputy director Saket Badola, DFO Kakasha Nasim, SDO GS Church, CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore, Keg was present on Friday.
According to the sources, the internal body of the tigers is said to be bad during postmortem.
This did not reveal the real cause of death of Tiger.
Departmental officials were responding to the death of Baghin.
However, IVRI Bareoli has been sent to confirm the poisoning of the internal organs of the tiger.
Forest conservationist Vivek Pandey said the death of the tiger could be said to be natural.
No signs of poisoning from the body of the tiger etc. have been found.
However, as the surrounding area is being searched for it, Bisara is being sent to confirm the poison.
Tripods deny that we are being affected by Obi-Wan.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripodi will be examined by State Carpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripodi has refused to deny the policy at the request of his political guru Eddie Obaid, the protector of the former New South Wales Obaid, whose government-controlled lands are self-sufficient.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed its investigation on Friday into whether Mr. Obaid had violated the circulars of the Legislation Policy from several State Ministers? Where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid at the time of the 2005 Apex.
Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday after the evidence provided by Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden self-interest of Mr. Obaid? that is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressured to launch public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against this and they wanted more time.
Enterprises of a circular for leases in 2009, which resulted in Obaid earning $2.5 million a year, were renewed from tenders without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused for change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi had called for a change in government lease policy
A transcript presented in a phone call to the ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries of Mr. Obaid after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," Mr. Tripod replied.
I can’t remember what I was talking about, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have fired into Syria.
Israeli fighter jets set a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there was at least one purpose needed.
According to an Associated Press report, the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has failed to carry out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a stringent procedure.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457 being used for the purpose of filling unskilled posts in Australia or reaching out to family and friends in an impoverished manner.
A government discussion letter was issued today, blaming the government's wording about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQueen said today that it could infuriate Australia's neighbouring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are coming to the end of the queue" and "Australian people are coming to work first" is a very nasty repetition at a time when the unions have called for a safe labor market."
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided with protection – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some people in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion letter outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about people smugglers, has implemented five cumulative changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the examination of the visa applicant can be made as to whether "the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominated person, the owner or related person of the visa sponsor is a relative or a personal partner."
Businesses may need to keep counting the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor fewer employees employed hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old boy had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after the death of his father, an elderly cousin of his had tied the wreckage, who was on the same ship.
Australian officials have taken the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died, according to a statement.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
HS2's work indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barrones Kremer said the project would "make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "very excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider further improving the rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Cramer, "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of Britain’s 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will also be well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
"Scotland is likely to have huge economic benefits from high-speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK," Brown said.
So we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and explore options for delivering the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and taking decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will now remain in force in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment regulations in the U.S., Australian airliners will have to continue shutting down their tablets and smart phones while taking flight and departing from the aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open options for U.S. air service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during important stages of flight.
Passengers can do this on a lot of flights right now, but many people don't feel good about being unable to get to their e-book etc. when they get off the plane.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which US air service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective in key phases of flight in Australia.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation to control the exhaustion of electrical equipment in aircraft," the authority said, "This issue comes under the regulations, according to which the air service operations are managed by the airlines and ensure that the security arrangements are implemented by the airlines."
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome a review by CASA in the case of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really think it will provide a better experience for customers, because we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft," the spokesperson said.
Quantas said that it will now comply with the current rules.
"We do not have an immediate plan to change it," he said, adding that "electrical equipment cannot be used during flight loading and landing as per our current policy."
The FAA's rulings apply to U.S. allele lines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each U.S. airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices, as well as they will have to make their own rules booklets, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and provide brief details to passengers.
"Following verification of the compatibility of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use light-weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones that hold hands at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to shut down their equipment while taking off the plane.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or in the upper cans during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Silver of Ponbrokers Due to Difficulty Sentenced by the Middle Class in Singapore
Janani Amirathlinga is taking cash to pay her daughter's school fees at the Bendemier Shopping Centre in Singapore by giving her gold token, ring and jewels.
Smt. Amirathlinga said, My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it.
She says, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, the same demand exists in parts of South-East Asia – where domestic debt is growing – for the valuemax where they are trading, which will become the third Ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Keeping jewelry is not the only way to get cash - Ms. Amirathlinga's case is $1,300 Singapore - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, Ponbroker typically charges interest at 17 per cent per annum, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch at the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the benefit of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are taking the plunge due to the growing cost of living and rising household and consumer debt due to the difficulties faced by families.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, the low and middle-income households are able to meet their needs due to the collapse of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards Angel Pours, described the rising domestic profit mainly due to rising mortgages (mortgages), as a risk factor for Asian banks' indebtedness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from this week's tech slump.
On Thursday, the data showed a steady decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
Sung Sung Wu, economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, [income-sized] middle-class people will try to increase their incomes in every possible way."
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have inspired people to keep personal possessions at bay, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to pamper their family’s jewelry.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the 200-pound outlets in the city-state are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold feels good, let's put Grandma's gold chain down, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Ejimani, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in the holding business that Outlet Manager Valumax in Bendimir and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhoods, Malaysia where it has four stores in Nikah, but also plans to expand Vaiks out of Asia.
The company will use 60 per cent of the $66 million it received in listings this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange to fund it.
While some discount lenders (borrowers) have been criticized for the high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that holding a giraffe not only gets an affordable rate compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers keep items that they already have, and refinancing personal belongings doesn't increase the domestic debt," he says.
The social acceptability of Ponbroking for short-term and secure financial assistance is on the rise.
It's not that only financially weak people use the Ponbrokers.

Saved $325 million for the health of Tagi.
The Union government has stressed that strict conditions are also attached to the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania's sickening health system, which will ensure that the state government cannot waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth, the island's aging population, is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the high rate of kidney disease, and systemic limitations.
The funding decision, which was taken over four years, was taken after consultation of the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms Plibersek said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the particular challenges facing the state.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and orthopaedic surgery, will help to resolve the previous collected cases.
It also includes funds to launch a personal electronic health record system in Hobart and Lansing clinics, better care after leaving hospital, training of medical specialists, mental health services and local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania,"" Ms Plibersek said."
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive funds from the Commonwealth, and report every month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that services are provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr Wilkie said $325 million would not be too much until "real improvements are made to bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more manageable level."
Yet, he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he had first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
"""I hope that the federal aid package will prove very helpful in separating the state from the crisis-stricken list of public health systems,"" he said."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will mainly offset the cuts made recently.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a band-aid solution."
"We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken in $430 million in its health care system," he told ABC TV.
You can't believe that nearly half a billion dollars will be taken away by the state government and 300 million dollars will be given by the Commonwealth as good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should be guaranteed that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Denis DeDeRotte's novel by Guillaume Niklaux has the best production design and description of the time period in the conversion, but it's become much more than it should have been.
Reflecting the time of France in 1760, this novel, Suzan's name tells the sad tale of the young Rice whom a member of his family sends to the convent.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the Voluntary Perpetrator Mother Superior, and becomes an object of sexual attraction to the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the narrative, the film also runs the risk of becoming boring for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entrance fees to the garden due to the spread of dirt in the garden.
At the same time, the departments have given a 15-day ultimatum to rectify the situation.
The Vice-Chancellor conducted an in-depth inspection of the sub-director seeds and field and director research along with the garden department at 10 a.m. on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including the Director, from his seat in these departments.
After the riots, he warned to cut wages the next time he was found absent.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for the whole month.
At a cost of Rs 1 per day, people will be able to walk in the garden.
The system will work: Files coming from various functions before the Vice-Chancellor will reach under one system.
Not every employee will have the right to file their file with the Chancellor’s Office.
The relevant officers will take the matter to their final Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its capacity to build its chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas warfare materials, while fierce fighting has erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to where the poisonous Aegean is located.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organisation (CWO) was made one day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organisation had designated Damscus to blend all chemical weapons into production units and poisonous gases and to destroy or "disable" the machinery used to fill up the war material.
Mainly to complete the initial stage of destruction, this ambitious event is a milestone aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Domscus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
Britain's situation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement came at a time when fighting escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a collection unit.
The group, which has details of the number of deaths through the network of the movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 6,365 children, 61,067 are common citizens, he said.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar Assads are members of the military, 18,678 fighters are in favour of the government and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the fighting since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military had been fighting rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said on Thursday that the people on both sides were killed, but clearly said nothing.
This war illustrates the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end poisonous weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short period of time.
"The team, working with the United Nations, said in a statement that it is ""satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment - as destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of the confirmation work by going to 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to go to two centres for security reasons.
The O.P.C.W. said on Friday that according to Syria, the two centers "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products placed there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where the O.P.C.W. inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I salute the firmness and courage shown by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,"" said Ahmed Uzumku, Director-General of the Monitoring Group, O.P.C.W."
The three-year-old civil war is mainly a struggle between Assad's government and its security forces, which are members of Shia Islam, the Alawite sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another incident, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Observatory, said that there was a strong explosion at the air defence centre in Syria's coastal area of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered copies of fake registers, fake stamps, laptops and fake registers from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Parmjit Singh Gill said the arrested persons include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bittu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and recorder of the registrar office Balbir Singh, took out the papers from the records of the vacant and old lands and thereafter bought new stamp papers and prepared forged registers on them.
Not only that, but the real registry was missing and the forged registry was uploaded to the record.
Thereafter, the accused sold the land on forged paper for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these fake papers were borrowed.
Thereafter, the real owner of the land was kept under pressure of the police and administration.
The accused, who had prepared the forged register, had special regard to the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one who oversees the land of NRIG.
Therefore, the forged register of those lands remains easy to sell by preparing them.
Police Commissioner Gill said that in the interrogation, the accused have so far prepared forged registers close to 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have already been registered against the gang's Saragana Rajiv.
Angered at the conviction of the bomber in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bombings were outraged at the sentencing of the bomber, saying Umar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who had been running as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
If granted parole, he can be released in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, though they could also demand that this person, who is called the infamous "destructive person" as the master person who made the bomb, be put to death.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Cortine, a woman living in Perth, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Preventing his injuries, he said that Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other savage terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told the A.A.P., "She should be brought before the firing squad."
Every day I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11:00 p.m., the club's nomination was deleted after the bomb exploded in the standing van outside the entire club.
Peter Hugues, who was in the paddy bar exactly 20 seconds before the explosion of a bagpack filled with explosives by suicide bombers.
He went to a month-long coma as a result of the bomb blast and was "dead" three times during his stay on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hugues says Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Islamic terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Meera - who had been sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, look, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bomb blasts.
He was spared nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in Abtatabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military had killed former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had provided evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan in an effort to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda to meet with Bill Laden.
Ms. Cortina says, "He did not surrender."
Even to this day, so many people don’t really have the pain of suffering mentally.
This decision, came ahead of this year's 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Cortin said, “This year will be a lot of tears.”
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.A.: Air travelers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but can't call from cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to enter the gate, to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to Naruto by their cellphones - Naruto will be able to talk to Naruto on Thursday.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their planes comply with the new guidelines, and how to show the guidelines, and the training books of their crew members and how to keep the rules up-to-date to collect the device.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted the plans.
"Based on the status of the scheme, we can very quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device," the F.A.A. said in a statement.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach an altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when the aircraft lands, and do not turn it on until the aircraft fully lands.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interference will be able to fly their passengers by air, allow them to use the device when they land on the plane and allow them to use it during taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these standards.
The President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented in a safe manner - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are bored with the feeling of "hall monitors."
But surfing, email-sharing, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online games like Scratchable, which is related to the famous event that when the actor Alex Baldwin, who was playing on his smartphone while staying at the plane park at the door in 2011, Uthman turned off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as they will cause the other person in the cabin to be worried about getting hurt.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory authority related to the phone call is with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
The FAA can remove the ban on some electronic devices during the flight of the aircraft and take-off.
Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board's Mark Rojenkan, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not only because they can potentially cause disruptions in navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruptions in cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rogers said.
To examine the issue, the Industry World Consultative Committee, formed by the FAA, last month submitted that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA to reduce the restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo have said there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device, according to the study.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when reports of interference in navigation and communication devices were received by passengers due to the carrying of FM radios and high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airlines are more reliant on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
The airline has been offering Wi-Fi to passengers at cruising altitudes for many years.
The modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
Huarta said that most airlines should comply with the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, according to the company.
The electronic device of today, the electronic device of the previous generation, emits a very low-power radio transmission compared to the previous generation.
For example, e-readers have a transmission of absolutely nominee only during page flips.
But transmissions are prevalent when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who take sides in reducing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, the company's officers loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airlines and blew them up to test for problems but no such problem was found.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
The National Air Passenger Association's Douglas Kid said he believes the interference with the device is real, no matter what the risk may be.
Other members of the committee said, there are reports only described by the pilot in support of obstruction by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee commented that the FAA allowed the pilot to order the occupants to shut down the device when the aircraft was taken down in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and said it has provided a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest round of technology.
C.E.O. Roger Dow of the U.S. Travel Association said, "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that travelling with joy is not inconsistent with passenger, rescue and safety.
Learning from the Sycilewar bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police have taken steps to ensure swift response in the wake of Diwali's celebrations and during the time of emergencies.
A total of 1,800 soldiers were stationed in all the city's main squares, crowded squares and other places to catch up with the perpetrators, including to prevent incidents of traffic jams, teaching the detractors and teaching them the lesson.
The men will be accompanied by female police personnel, including PCR, Traffic Unit.
Police personnel and commandos will check duty tax records with vigilance at the city's hotels, guest houses and other places, including PG.
The police have directed the SHO to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for investigation of the cases.
The DSP has been given the task of inspecting markets, malls and other places, including VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the Diwali festival, the high authorities have also imposed duties of additional police personnel in police control for the convenience of the people.
The fire department and PGI Director, Principal Director and DHS, including Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management, were asked to keep high alerts in times of emergency from the personnel of other dispensaries.
Department officials have now put others, including women police personnel, on duty by naming the 'anti-gunda staff' under the leadership of NGOs to teach the mindset.
Anti-Gunda staff members will hold up the men in plain clothes at crowded places, including at markets, while the policemen will hold up the menaces.
All SHOs on Diwali have been ordered to lay 44 noses in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also remain at 38 naka points on the city's borders.
Bird was released back into the forest by air transport from North C Rig for safety
The bird, found decapitated at North C Oil Rig, has been released back into the woods by air transport from the coast.
The bird, called the Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by a helicopter prior to being rehabilitated by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Eloah.
"This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which came in the grip of strong winds over the North Sea,"" said Central Manager Colin Seddon."
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
"""It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help,"" he said."
The waterway was clean and well-maintained before leaving.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and it was promised to bring the business together and determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with the U.K.'s employment and prosperity maker EU.
For him, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what their views are about the UK’s business with the EU.
The U-Government considered 1,000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on those countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are becoming immobile.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than getting involved in the long-term and vicious process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial skills should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation in Brussels is far more than the benefits of being a part of Europe's commercial sector. Even the vast majority of entrepreneurs are wealthy, who traditionally
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants to move forward on a path of trade-based relationship and treaty change rather than politics with the UK, the U.S.
This finding, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, reflected that businesses are driving toward a "significant change" that would give the U.K. back its lost power.
Its price is very high - the issue of treaty change for the UK and getting a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favour of staying in the EU in the polls.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: it is a survey scenario that UK businessmen, the U.S. support their plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the U.S.
It also showed that businessmen, the current power balance, expect to renegotiate making a meaningful change in favour of the U.K.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming mandatory very quickly, as the Eurozone, the tied economy and the fiscal union are moving forward.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that this means for businesses a new focus on commerce and a fundamental change in the regulatory functioning of Brussels.
Gazprom's Alexi Miller announces the start of a new round of pipeline in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the launch of the construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria marked the launch of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today, a historic event has taken place: construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline has begun, which is the largest and most important project in Europe,” said Alexi Miller, President of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide a variety of export routes to Russia in Europe.
Officials said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is for Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes in a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's Counterpart and Gazprom.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the associated geo-political risks associated with transit countries "forever."
After the start of operation of the entire project in the year 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (NGG)

The Royal Commission heard allegations of sexual offences against two employees of Y.M.C.A. before the charges against Jonathan Lord
Before the charge against caring-out child care employee Jonathan Lord was levelled in 2011, two employees of Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement to the Commission, it said it had "never found a case of child sexual harassment within its organisation," the Commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Greene was asked about the case in which a child pornography offence was alleged against an employee of Y.M.C.A., and another case in which Bhaghya Bhaghya Bhaghya Bhagwa was charged in the year 1991 with the care of the Y.M.C.Bhagwa Bhagwat on the Y.M.Bhagwa Gym Instructor of Karingbha Bhagwa Bhagwa in 1991.
Mr. Hare, a lawyer who assisted the Commission, said he knew about the first case but did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of Y.M.C.A. before the Commission that "Y.M.C.A. has been externally examined and he has found Y.M.C.A. to be at the forefront in the matter of child safety" is also not accurate.
It is evidence before the Commission that Y.M.C.A. was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Greene, who is associated with Y.M.C.A. at the age of 21, admitted that the management has failed because of the appointment of the Lord "including myself", and failed to ensure that the employees were exposed to violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure at Y.M.C.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Green denied the suggestion that Y.M.C.A. had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report a child safety violation by the Lord.
Employees gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, including spending time alone with children by Lord, having them babysit privately, putting them on their lap, telling them he loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, and who had spoken for child safety training, as she was concerned about his conduct, testified that Y.M.C.Karingabh Bhawan, who supervised the Lord, had been in charge of the child care department at Karingabh Bhawan and Y.M.C.Karingabh Bhawan at Karingabh Bhawan.
The C.E.O. said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving the above information from their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to inform him about it.
Mr. Greene said that he had provided his view to the Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. Mandal that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was the text for the organization "about not informing".
Mr. Greene said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the allegations came to light, was made by Y.M.C.A.'s Child Services Director, Liam White.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the blending of evidence, but it was not "excessively" and correctly executed.
Stephen Smallbone, a special professor of child sexual exploitation at Griffith University, said that Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between the years 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "grave problems" in recruitment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to go back to the UK.
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no chance of a return.
In an interview on the night of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007, a decade later as a leader, most of his comments confined himself to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and peace founders of the Middle East group, Mr Blair said, far from discussing British politics.
Asked if they would like to return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying this: "Yes, of course, but it's not likely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the trading community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts gathered at Cardiff for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even gone to school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his pawn Shetland’s tattu taffy easily completed three stages and won the top prize – he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equinox Center in Ruddry near Cardiff, the indistinguishable pair - which has just lengthened Sk - was highly praised for their appearance, behavior and style.
In front of beautiful men and women wearing ballerina hats, she shattered her flat hat at the angle of the alder and circled her two-year-old toffee ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control that is far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has been practicing with this tattoo from Shetland every day since then.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a wonderful couple.
They had to face the challenge from all the contenders, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rouge.
It was only the second opportunity when he took part in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy about his victory.
The most different in this landscape, he felt so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take photos with him.

Shrimat Howells said: "The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating happiness and playing tali."
He was running on the grass all over the landscape, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fanton is a lover of animals - he loves horses, tractors and the farm, and he has foaled two chickens that he takes care of.
The kind of horse he has started will be in the best horse show of the year a long time ago - and I'm sure he will perform very well.
"Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his teddy bear,"" an annual horse exhibition spokeswoman said."
They are a very good couple.
The decision makers gave points considering the way of performance of Fanton and Toffee and the way of their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Tattu and his rider - in this case, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm quite sure that Fenton's loving clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be a "nuclear upgrade"
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the front page to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be reinstated, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express had given a vicious public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But thereafter Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had taken bribes to write intriguing news about the state-owned company.
The regulator said the new express now has to go through "complete reform."
The order for "improvement" came from the administration of Gwangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had printed a lot of false news about the listed company JumLoyen in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
"The editorial management of the new express was unorganized,"" Viniamak said in a statement."
It said it had decided to impose an administrative penalty "by cancelling the license of the reporter of Chen Yangzhou."
It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete overhaul of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express and to immediately amend the leadership of the New Express.
Mr. Chen had written many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Joomla.
After being pursued, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came on state television, agreed to write and publish fake stories for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Jumlayon as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people,"" he told state broadcaster CTV."
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have admitted to the broadcasting of the TV show.
Experts say that guilt-acceptance is enforced from time to time, despite the fact that in the latter half of this year, a law forbade authorities from forcing a person to self-convict.

U.S.-Mexico railway found in drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, including its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot triple-foot tunnel as one of the most intricate secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly equal to six football pitches, which connects the gondola near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with a similar warehouse, which makes it easy to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said it had been shut down before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, officials have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
The three persons, who officials said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment from 10 years in prison.
Traffickers in Nogless, Arizona, take advantage of the huge underground water drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since the year 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after Central Mexico's Marijuana crop in October, which puts the drug mafia groups' ability to challenge how they can quickly reach the product to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, which stretched from the warehouse of a house in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.

The British police have sent a notice of extradition to Asanjee.
The British police sent an extradition notice to Julian Asanje, founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "deliverance notice" to the 40-year-old Australian assassin, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as saying that if he failed to do so, he would be responsible for being arrested himself.
As a result of allegations of sexual offences, he is facing extradition to Sweden, as well as his choice under British law ended at the time while the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against the extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the U.S., fearing that he had asked the South American country for political shelter, on June 19 to seek refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
A spokesperson said that the Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Asanje, for which he was required to appear at the police station on the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the issue of police notices.
Assad fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. government cables on a privacy-adversarial website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be expelled from Sweden to face potential spying allegations.
A fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between the legs
On the driver, a fine of 1,000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) has been imposed for driving the car at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by keeping a hot drink between the legs.
Tiptrey, 35, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in the hearth on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found them drinking on their feet.
Howe has admitted the charge of negligently driving the car in the Callchester Magistrate Court.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in him being banned from driving for up to six months.
He was also ordered to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 surcharge.
Foreign Property Taxes Will End London's Artificial Status on Owners
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who has paid <0xC2><0xA3>7 million in the 2012 budget to the PKT for more than <0xC2><0xA3>7 million in flats, and to a person who has paid <0xC2><0xA3>7 million in flats, rather than a single person
In the tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North East, and North East.
Mr. Cook said: "Increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Aviation Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the tax on high-value properties is less than the tax on the property that is reasonably priced.
"But this move may silence some foreign investors in buying property in London and make them unwilling to sell to current owners," he added.
The top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market, which has spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 per cent last year, according to the price in prosperous south-west London.
According to Seville's research, Central London's prices continued to rise regularly by 5.6 per cent each year, but rising slightly lower than the "home market", as the city's south-west, north-southeast (7.4 per cent) and east-southeast (6.6 per cent) are seen to be the same.
Scientists have shed further light on what is the relationship between the dog's tail and his mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their dog more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the journal Cort Biology.
From the University of Trento, neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vallertagra said: "In humans, it's all well known that the left and right parts of the brain are differentiated into stimuli that involve positive or negative emotions.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that in dogs like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed gestures and the opposite order, and the two globules played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-sided sniffing by other dogs, the researchers looked at the animals watching other dogs’ films.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behaviors.
We probably won’t take much time to understand why their ducks sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We introduced dogs with dog films - in the shadow-picture to deal with the realistic version or other issues that confuse them, and we could see the tail's curvature and present the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw an unemotional dog wagging his tail to the right (dog's eyes), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail turning mainly to the left (again from the dog's sight), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Valleratigra, they do not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their own experience about what actions they should be worried about and not on whom.
"If you've met several times with other dogs, and if they move their tail one side at a time, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better insight into the animals' feelings.
Visiting the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinarian Sciences, dog behavior expert John Bradshaw said it’s not the first study to check out whether it’s important for dogs to run left or right.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail moved to the left rather than to the right, it was more likely to get close to it rather than being uncomfortable."
He said that this difference was because in various studies, dogs were not completely swayed by animals or robots in films.
He clarified that studying how dogs react to real dogs could help in this.
"While there is plenty of evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, the ease with which their behavior can be recorded makes it seem like we probably won’t take much time to understand why their ducks sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Alex Turner's Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow Gig due to illness
The Rock Bank, called Arctic Monkeys, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from a sneeze.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to re-determine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to postpone Gigg in the same way at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: After taking medical advice tonight following the decision to postpone the show at Bermindham LG Arena, Arctic Monkeys will be held in Arusha on November 1, at Glasgow High on Friday.
"In the investigation, Alex Turner was found to have had a rash, and they are sadly not able to perform."
The LG Erina show in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the Glasgow Hydro show will take place on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for this show.
We apologise for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service at the box office from which you bought the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, who are priests of the highest rank in the Catholic Church, hold their office only below the pope, and these are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will choose the first group of his persons, who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes in the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the new cardinals are promoted, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which the pope calls the assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the February Pope-Council in advance, so as to make it easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valerio of the Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
In general, the pope declares the number of cardinal electors to be less than 120, the number of cardinals, and the number of cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The pope's assembly next year will be important, as it will be the first pope's assembly after France's election in March this year, Valerio said.
Currently, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new popes, also from the rest of the world, appoint cardinals to restore balance," he said.
There are forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number is very low in cardinals.
The Council of Cardinals - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose work is to find ways to reform the church - will also be the first cardinals to be elected after they are formed.
Before that, the pope made all the decisions on his own.
"""Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,"" Valerio said."
He said it was "possible" that Francis Cardinals would seek advice.
But we are not in this situation before - it is completely new.
Valerio said that the pope usually gives the post of cardinal to the bishops of large places, but Francis was "totally surprised - so we don't know whose name they would announce."
G.M. called back pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
The General Motors Company, its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and G.M.C. Syracuse pickup truck has a 19-inch foldable seatback in hand-held pickup trucks, according to a report from U.S. Auto Safety Regulators on Friday.
In some trucks, there may be a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union Auto failed to comply with safety standards regarding seatback, head restraints.
According to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "If the vehicle gets stuck in the rear, it is possible that the head restraint, the driver, could not properly protect it, which would increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between August 1st and September 10th.
G.M.'s trucks began shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it represents the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker.
G.M. had told the truck owners about the fault in the latter half of October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government ban, which had hampered the growth in auto sales in October.
G.M. said on Friday, the sales of Silverado and Syrah trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had a 20 per cent increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Syrah pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM's stock in the New York Stock Exchange surged by 1.4 per cent.
Disappointment of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of change.
He said that Obama's great efforts have been hampered due to the policy of blocking the GOP
The Obamacare website's obstruction policy can't justify drone attacks.
Obama's 2008 campaign reminiscent of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book about which I think it will inspire me during the second year of medical school and spark a ray of hope in me.
Its name is "the courage to win," and it is a commemoration of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I am filled with the sheets of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and the press had taken a break to show the historical significance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my peers, and my parents saved every newsletter they received.
A team of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82% approval rating when he became President of the United States in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of missed opportunities.
It really changed after the first time I voted for it.
Simply put, I could not have imagined any of it.
I credit Obama with many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our military from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask" until Osama bin Laden was killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposing bias has hindered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for health services, shutting down at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times that I have put myself on the side of the Obama administration in front of colleagues and comrades, I have the answer that I can give them.
I have come to the point of political despair.
The Republican opposition policy is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency storing data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor can it respond to the prosecution of people who expose the wrongdoings of the government.
It cannot explain the cause of the murder of an American citizen without a trial, nor the public funds and spending limits that were reduced during the President's campaign.
It cannot respond to the findings of the report, which says the White House's efforts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it cannot justify the failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know if I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government, could break the political campaign that would bring it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a predictable path, as anti-political parties and random events such as the Newtown murders, will shape our public debate.
Yet the examples I have given above, they seem to be mostly self-chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I re-voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romani presented a misleading and an uncertain choice, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, returning to the year 2008 through that book has become very difficult.
When I look at him, I remember his missing promises.
I was reading a part of the book this week, which described how Clinton had a huge loss to Nahua due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they needed to get back on track, and stay true to their goals.
"I want to get my mojo back,"" he said."
We need to remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I can no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Pammar claims PM Tony Abbot's interest in paternity leave scheme is in conflict
Billionaire M.P. Clive Pamar has said that there is a conflict of interest of Prime Minister Tony Abbott over the paternal leave scheme as his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining sector's Maharathi, who is in dispute over the payment of the $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
Pamar can control up to four votes in the U.S. Senate, which may be important in determining whether to cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be contested, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
Pamar said, "He may have an important interest in the issue of parental leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he will have an immediate interest in whether or not he is on leave."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Pamar as the winner by 53 votes from the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax after falling again.
Mr. Pamar called for the resumption of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the results of the elections come two months after we have voted?
"We should have a better system,"" he said."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill out our rollover on the computer, vote immediately and have results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of the pencil to stamp the ballots.
That's because if a person doesn't like it, they can erase it?
Nowadays, it is quite insane to use a pencil.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion letter with New Zealand.
Pamar, 59, said his policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new job "very seriously."
Public office is for public service.
"We don't need any other awards other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this important time,"" he said."
This caused trouble for the defendants.
Addressing the assembly held on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed intense anger over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said the growing attacks on the lawyers and their families prove that the criminals have gone insane.
There is no fear of the police and administrative system on them.
Referring to recent incidents of this kind in different places, he said that when the advocate is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily imagined.
RBS has suspended two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two experts from the case have received this information, it is another indication that the exchange is a suspicious manipulation by the brokers in the forex market. The transaction was carried out by the brokers
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigations into the world's largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, which has been suspended as the probe of the case, which appears to be recurring, continues to be ongoing.
The bank has refused to comment on the closure, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
"Two weeks ago, the bank had said, ""Our investigation in this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts in the case had said that RBS had sent the former trader and sent the records of emails and instant messages received from him to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Usher left RBS in the year 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current position of European head of Forex Spot Trading at J.P. Morgan.
The head of European spot trading in the city, Rohan Ramchandani, had gone on vacation last week, while the former senior broker at Barclays and UBS was suspended by the Standard Charter this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case said Mr. Ushar's instant message group includes barracks and sitigroup bankers.
UBS said that after being told by Swiss regulator Finma that she is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority, the VCO, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are charging banks with their favorable take-downs in the currency market.
People familiar with the case said HSBC, CitGrup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or have received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years in search of clues to any wrong activity.
The news about the investigation-report has stirred up confusion among traders in such a region, who have been among the leading earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenges this year due to the low take-offs in the currency
While some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to deal in the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, senior traders say it does not have to be true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of foreign exchange buy-sales, the liquidity gap between the different trading platforms and the growing use of its own trading platform by banks can be bridged by the fact that "you're a little bit short"
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse had announced the trader would be serviced this week from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London, which had lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone, and that he has been controlled,"" Credit Suisse said."
This time, students studying other courses, including technical and management, will be able to exercise their voting rights.
The University Chancellor has written a letter to the Governor seeking permission to hold elections.
With the start of the admission process to the university, the demand for student union elections began to rise.
He had also carried out a signature campaign to convey his voice to the university administration and college management regarding the selection of his representative.
Students who will be able to enroll in nearly two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Biosciences, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be able to choose their representative this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise voting rights for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof. Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has been asked for permission to hold elections at the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as the permit is granted.
"""Elections to other colleges are the responsibility of the college management,"" he said."
Many colleges do not want to have a student union election at their campus.
However, due to the lack of unity among the students, the elections are not being held.
The Council had signed a campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Consolidator ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will be asked to hold elections in the colleges.
Even with the unresolved view of the colleges regarding the student union elections, there are problems.
On Dhanteras, people have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from pots in the capital.
The number of such purchases has increased by 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year.
In Shimla, a crowd of langars was putting on jewelry shops.
A large crowd was also seen in the shops of pots decorated from the lower market to the mall road.
This year, though, the price of such items has been rising, but people have still not been keen to buy at a good price.
Goodwill for purchase on Friday remained from 7:52 a.m. to 10:12 p.m. and from 1:56 a.m. to 3:37 a.m. and from 6:17 a.m. to 8:12 p.m.
At the time of the said three muhurts, more crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla flocked for more shopping.
In Shimla lower market, people did not find a place to hang their feet.
The same thing happened in every big store.
In such a situation, when the purchase of Dhanteras, which is celebrated as the Triodashi Dhantrayodshi of the Krishna Party of Kartik Month, is a sign of Shubh Dipawali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges decided in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase health insurance or pay a fine before the year 2014 - in favour of the injunction that it had the power to impose tax on the government.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court has also supported the remaining 2700-page sections of the law, saying that the condition of the Health Service Act that the state would increase Medicaid eligibility or that they would provide all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally detrimental.
The petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Free Trade Union (NAFTA) to stop the law.
The opposition to the law during the initial session of 2012 was made by all the major Republican presidential candidates, including project nominees Mitt Rumni.
We can't do our job without money.
Money is one of the greatest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
We celebrate Krishna Triodashi of Kartik month, Dhanteras.
Dhanteras is worshipped by the god of wealth Kuber and the god of death Yamraj.
Money is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
We have a good feeling about the value of money.
There can be no more valuable thing than that which has benefited the welfare of mankind, but there is no meaning to the wealth which has become the cause of arrogance.
We make money with a holy purpose and spend it with a holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the incalculable accumulation or the tendency to earn yen-can-exercise money destroys our conscience, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
A portion of the money you give can also be the basis of someone's life satisfaction.
We should all think for the many people in society who are living in terrible absence.
In fact, in the mantras of life, meaning, religion, work and moksha are given equal importance.
All people wish for wealth and success, and they get wealth and success according to their masculinity.
The same wealth is enduring with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone else’s work.
If you have money, don't give it to anyone else.
The true rich man is the one who makes the way of flowing in countless hands of wealth.
There can be no use of money more than the creation of employment for others.
Money is not just a form of money.
It would also be like your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

After the general election, if the new government continued its policy of shutting down sales of kerosene through rations, half a dozen states would not get kerosene at these stores.
The states that will stop selling kerosene include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
In addition, Kerosin sales in some states in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Northeast are also set to close.
According to the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to close the sale of kerosene at PDS stores in the states on two bases.
The first base, then, is being built for rapid electricity connection in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, most of the rural families in the states that have been given kitchen gas connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made a lot of preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS Kerosin in Delhi has already closed since October, 2013.

This encourages those who are discriminated against.
In the states where sales will be closed through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.

NEW DELHI: BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate part of Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, staged sweeping attacks on the Congress during an election rally on Friday.
"""Sometimes a coalition government was formed in many states and at the centre of the country, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a Communist government, sometimes a BJP government,"" Modi said."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I appeal to the political pandits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be determined in the country.
What did the party do?
If it comes to comparative results, it will not be up to the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Wherever the BJP government has been constituted, efforts have been made to meet the aspirations of the people.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai's government had low inflation.
The poor man was given food for two hours.
But when the Congress or its backing government was formed, the poor man did not get enough to eat.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become proud of itself.
They don't even respond to the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer the people.
Addressing the attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, "A question is being asked from Modi today. In 2014, when the people give blessings to the BJP, they will present their work to the people every year.
In a democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, but a servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi there should only be slaves.
Friends of the Congress are leaving the globe on the day.
Friends, we have already passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people have a history.
In the case of Nortel Patent, an economic suit has been filed against Google, Sasamung, Hui.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed numerous patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it had thwarted at Nortel's bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
A group called Rockstar, which had purchased 4.5 billion patents in the United States, filed suit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., H.T.C. Corporation, Huawei and four others for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple's Microsoft, Blackberry, Erection, and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The suit said that these patents also include technology that combines words searched on the Internet with words matched by advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely rivalled by Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google put forward an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google, by increasing the bid several times, eventually offered a bid of $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons being a long list of patents near Motorola.
The suit said that "despite losing an attempt to acquire patents-in-suite in the auction, Google has violated, and is continuously violating"
Rockstar has sought increased compensation against Google, as the allegation is that the infringement of patents by Google is unfortunate.
He believed in the first freely elected president of Egypt.
Mohammad Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his Victory Day in Egypt barely ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi vowed "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first freely elected president, Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
At his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab has become the world's first freely elected Islamist president, and the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of the state some 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office in front of 18 judges, who were blackwashed by the court, on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony on national television, Morsi said, "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has lived as an illegally declared organization for 84 years since its founding, and which has been under the auspices of previous governments, is a self-sacrificing citizen of the U.S. and a trained engineer of the 60-year-old Morsi of the party, said: "Aj Mi
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and, according to local time, arrived in the small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to give Mubarak to the new president apart from the thunder of the President, traffic was also halted for a short time, so that their motor convoy is connected to the city, which is normally occupied by a narrow street
Morsi, who was mocked as a non-committal "empty tire" of Brotherhood, rose much in personal prestige after his victory and on Friday his speech presented him not only as a workaholic but also as a candidate of all those who have been nominated for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a chamber with wooden panels, saying, "Today, Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band played the national tune and were officially welcomed while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
Upon their arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand."
Established in 1908 as the Fortress of Secular Education, Cairo University later became the Fortress of Islamic Student Groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's reign of Tanashah last year, and relinquished the Presidential powers taken from his post by the military council removed from him last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court instead of taking the competent oath of Parliament, they usually bow before the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tehari Square was filled with theatrical popular currencies.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its purpose is to make the surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in the people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
Six U.S. companies, including Google and Yahoo, have welcomed this move by the Senate.
The NSA has also shut down the data centers of these companies.
The Senate's Pravda Committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] by 4 votes to 11 on Friday.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on monotonous phone tapes under the U.S. Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, intentionally unauthorized data collection and its use will be considered an offence and for this a sentence of ten years imprisonment has been provided.
The bill will become law after both Houses of Congress have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The committee's chairman and senator, Diana Festin, said the program to record the NSA's phone is under the law and I believe it has made an important contribution to the security of the country.
But despite this, more transparency needs to be brought in.
Not only that, the safety of the public should also be taken into account.
Meanwhile, angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill as the NSA's internet surveillance program was unveiled.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who are stabbed to record the phone on a large scale by the NSA.
It is noteworthy that former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the curtain from the documents issued by the NSA's actions.
The international community is deeply outraged by the revelation of the telephonic surveillance of the talks by the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

These include e-mail, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the U.S. and a Benami telecom provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the U.S., as court orders are required for such operations in the U.S.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, it never happened.
The NSA has always kept all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently become a target for spying on the German Chancellor.

Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
Students in English literature courses must read at least a play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British history after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English Literature and Language course will be completed.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate G.C.S.E. in language, and will be very inspiring to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two topics in which there will be revolutionary change.
It will also change in other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam will showcase the changes in the structure of the G.C.S.E. along with the new grading system, and the lower course.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said that "there was a lot of consensus on this, that, in order to restore people's confidence, we need to improve our own exam system," he said. "The G.C.S.E. is "more challenging, more ambitious and more ambitious."
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours in a year or - 3 hours less in a week during a session than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours in a year, while in Singapore, the average is 138 hours.
While, there was no formal requirement to give mathematics more time, coalition sources said that the extensive mathematics G.C.S.E. - League table combined with the subjects for more weight was an incentive to provide additional education in schools.
This course will focus more on the "problems of the real world," including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to stop media coverage of the incident.
The Supreme Court said it could not tell the media not to report any information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that can be used in such a case.
Asaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but especially there are two channels that make them more troublesome.
They're damming their image and reporting it one-sidedly.
In this case, the right of asylum should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies he could use.
In opposition questions at the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put a spot in the opposition by saying that he had not looked at a woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was amazed at where the woman's conversation finally came from.
Perhaps Bansal's hint was on the side of a major BJP leader and a councillor's domestic ties.
Turning to the other side of the issue, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had plotted to put a woman behind it during the last parliamentary election that failed.
In an interview with reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned them in the railway brigade.
If they were made witnesses in the case, would they be made only after the full investigation?
Bansal said he had written a letter only to a needy person in the booth scam they are talking about.
If that is their sin, they will continue to commit it.
He said though the corporation had no constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he asked the opposition to speak for itself.
He said that the opposition will be given a list of 15-year development works for as far as it is a matter of telling about the development works.
The way Chandigarh is developing or is going to be, they can't even think about it.
There was an exchange of greetings between the two at the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi in the think-tank camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
The Chief Minister had the same feeling on his face that he took Singh's speech in a positive way.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the think-tank and to protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that to keep his word, he was also ready for dismissal from the Cabinet.
By the way, there are hopes of a new mindset in the matter of seating the workers at government posts after the emerging opinion in the Thought Camp.
State JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in 20 Sutri committees would be announced soon.
His sign was that the list was almost ready.
It is now reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will review the list at his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs-Parliaments has been taken into account in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers.
MLAs have been accused of not taking their views into account in making a list of nominations.
Names of people who came from other parties much later have been entered in the list while many important activists who have been active since the days of the Equality Party have been overlooked.
When some people are born with a silver sponge, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
Among such persons, a name also comes from Sw. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of posthumous Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, in a school in a small village in Chorawad, Gujarat.
Among the five siblings, Dhirubhai was third.
The five children of the family include Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of high school.
Dhirubhai had started to provide financial help to the house in his childhood.
At the time they were setting up a bhajia shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists who came here.
Dhirubhai’s first job was in 1949 when he arrived in the city of Eden, Yemen, from a ship called Kabota at the age of 17.
His elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him here, so he had no trouble finding a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they came back to Vatan.
In 1955, a fortune-teller arrived in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
And that’s where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back again.
His name was not only popular in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he owned Rs 62,000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently in charge of his sultanate.
Like the father, today the names of these two brothers are among the international-level businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

The proposal to raise taxes will soon be put before the Cabinet.

It is important to note that the Resource Committee, chaired by the Minister of Urban Development, Mohammad Azam Khan, has been formed to improve the financial health of the government.
According to the sources, many of the tax-raising proposals in the recent meeting of the Resource Committee were rejected by the committee, which had a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given a green flag to the proposal to raise taxes on repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
It is proposed to double the tax on these.
At present, 4 per cent VAT and 1 per cent surcharge have been levied.

Similarly, the Committee has not yet given the green flag to raise taxes on transmission wire etc. electrical goods saying that this could have an impact on the general public as a result of the electricity being expensive.
The committee also did not consider the proposal to impose green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: The security of former Congress minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who has joined the Peoples Democratic Party, has allegedly been withdrawn by the police.
Khan held the state government responsible for this, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the 2002 elections on the ticket of the PDP from Shopian, is said to have been the Chief Minister of the country while Mufti Muhammad Said was in his cabinet.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said, "I have been getting security blankets since the year 1996.
I live in so-called terrorist forts.
At my house, a CRPF security battalion was deployed under the direction of the sub-inspector.
I also have security guards with me, but all my security was suddenly taken away on Friday.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he just said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contact was made with IGP Abdul Ghani Mir of Kashmir in this regard, he denied the information of the case and said it was a sensitive case.
I will examine for myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has finally been removed.
State Congress chief Prof Saifudin Soj said there is nothing like this in my information.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the last four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA's reign (between 1999 and 2004), Atal Vihari Bajpayee's time as Prime Minister was when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
"""There was no publicity on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary,"" Modi said on Thursday, laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high 'Statue of Unity' statue in Kevdia, Gujarat."
While the records of the DAVP show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel ads.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari was asked about Modi's claims, he said the BJP's PM does not speak on the basis of the facts.
UPA did not get any ads on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements each year is much less than the amount spent on the guests and guests of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and due date, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "It should not be viewed from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of the advertisement for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which people who oppose without knowing about it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader.
He will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally on Sunday.

Proceeding through the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Welle is providing free health services in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not too many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Vote here, or use your mobile phone to vote.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of the C.N.N. in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the top 10 to become the C.N.N. Year Hero.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had come to terms with his sick father and, being unconscious, had seen him go to the hospital, which was not adequately equipped to assist him.
Jaime Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon, Yonda.
At first, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he developed blood clots, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon,"" says Georges Well."
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Welle kept circling clinics and hospitals full of huge crowds with his father and receiving whatever treatment he could get.
"""It's not easy,"" Well said."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. hoping that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may end up in the mouth of death while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since Vel's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon can not bear its cost.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the spending on health care in the country is private sector.
Well says, "The only problem they have is poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well made a firm determination to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free measles treatments last year.
He also became a physician himself, and began working as a Vascular Surgeon at the Center Hospital of Yonde.
And he started the non-profit organization Escovaim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and up to 30 people sit in the van, take up medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes they don't even get along with them.
They have to push the vehicle forward more than once by pushing it out of rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they get the truly heroic respect: the best home that can be offered by the community, singing and dancing.
Free medical service in these villages is really the reason to celebrate, and Well - with its great smile and endless energy - includes joy and happiness.
The next morning, his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
"We are meeting 500 people in each trip,"" Well said."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people may get a diaper, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required by the school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple ailments with local sanitation.
The operation is usually done at the school building, town hall or at home; after the procedure, the patient goes to the recovery site and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes sanitizing equipment in a room with generator operation, and Well and his volunteers work up and down on Sunday mornings.
This is a slow pace, but village musicians generally help to keep the team motivated.
"""They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work,"" Well said."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes Cameron's physicians and foreign medical students - has had 700 free diabetic treatments last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said that because of getting free hernia surgery, he will be able to go back to work.
The man said, "This will change my life and that of my family."
In addition to running the clinic on weekends and working as a sputum doctor in the hospital, Wal also works in the private medical clinic around the gym at night.
He said this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is filled with private donations.
Cathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Wells group, said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well's campaign, this is a pilot opportunity that they can never get in their own country.
O'Malley said, "In the field of advanced medicine, in which we help to grasp tools for Dr. Well or clear blood stains, we have been able to gain experimental experience in them."
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteers usually spend on their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after the arrival of the Yonda, they come to live, and the cost of the instructions is borne by the well.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For the well, the workload is almost the same, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, these are the things that give them great joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they're watching what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Check out Escovaim's website and find out how to help.
You may not be sure, but it is true.
Not only that, the name of Mission Road has been named after Nagar Parshad president Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express its annoyance over some of the city's bad roads.
The event was led by JAMMO's Union Secretary Sachiadanand Pandey.
Speaking at a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you'll find that they don't talk about what they've done."
"""Congress has become so proud that it does not answer the media's questions,"" he said."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs to respond to Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to them to avoid questions from journalists.
Sibal also challenged Modi to hold a debate in front of him.
"""I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form a government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year,"" Modi said."

Obama's health care bill has been withdrawn.
In the midst of a whirlwind of criticism, President Obama withdrew his often-repeated misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue it if you like your health plan."
As well as receiving cancellation information from their providers by millions of people, the Republicans have criticized the President for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "very many people who have health insurance, and it is useful, can continue it."
Addressing the cancellation, which he calls a "flash of news," Obama has graced the US citizens receiving this information with the purchase of new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or even a comprehensive health care plan cheaper than proposed.
"You'll get a better deal,"" he said."
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buys insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plan because their coverage, affordable care is not in line with the standards desired under the Act.
In a statement to the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelias said, "I tell these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better than this.'"
Sebelias, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market since October has been "unfortunate."
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,"" he said."
I want to regain your faith.
Sebelias, a friend sitting behind him in the House hearing with the Republican, said this sentence in anger, which was captured by a Mike. Billie Long, R-Mo on whether they need to be nominated for Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelios why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act, through Health Care Dot Gow, has not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan.

In an unexpected admission, John Kerry said the U.S. spying "has gone unnecessarily far ahead."
John Kerry has indicated that the U.S.’s protective attitude on its surveillance program has softened by unexpectedly admitting that sometimes its espionage “goes too far unnecessarily forward.”
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty along with Barack Obama in the case of informant Edward Snowden being on an "automatic pilot" as a counter-offensive disclosure about the NSA's spying activities.
This secrecy has brought the U.S. government diplomatic grounding in ties with its partner countries.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me, and other people in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened in the 9th century with the automatic pilot, the war and the war, because look back at the Second World War.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S. spying has stretched its boundaries, but have insisted that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone a long way unnecessarily."
And the President is determined to make this clear to the people and is now making a thorough review so that there is no sense of abuse in any person.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the N.S.A. was striving for a good cause, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up,"" he said."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from actually crashing, destroying buildings, and killing people because we have been able to know about the plans of others in advance.
During this, on Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that the U.S. legislators will seek to reconcile the U.S. with Europe to resolve concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage.
Connect Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and has threatened to stop his participation in anti-terrorism organizations due to the turmoil over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
In an interview with Washington, Murphy, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Democratic Party was elected for the first time and said, "It is really important for our U.S. national security interests that we join U.S. counter-terrorism forces.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the N.S.A. program.
Reports of the recording of millions of European phone conversations by the N.S.A. have brought bitterness to the relationship with some of the U.S. allies, though the head of the agency said these reports are not entirely accurate with the N.S.A., and united by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that the N.S.A. has been monitoring the cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper, defending the incident of spying on allied countries, called it necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office is arranging a Congress visit likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include both parties and members of both chambers.
The names of other participating law-makers will be released in the coming days.
We are still working on the travel programme, he said.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "unrealistic relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders, along with their people, would also have to be honest with their spying programs that have been used for years.
"Although we can amend our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this, this weekend, Mr. Carrie is scheduled to go to the Middle East and Poland, where he will resolve disputes about U.S. surveillance activities ranging from the U.S. strategy to Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of changing boards in municipal corporations has begun.
Recently, Trinamool has been transformed into a board of directors due to the change of the board of the Congress leadership in Sanithia Municipal in Veerbhumb district.
The change came as most of the councillors of the Congress, including the chairman of the municipality, joined the trinamool.
Some councillors of the Congress, the BJP and the forward bloc have also taken up the trinamool repression here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy said it was a good sign for the party.
Sanitia Municipal Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, among others, joined the 10 councillors of the Congress in Trinamool, he said.
Some left-wing councillors, including the MCP, have also held up the flag of Trinamool.
All have informed the district magistrate in writing under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and the Sanitiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool as per the number force.
Mr. Rai also claims that all are in agreement with what has been decided for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including the Congress, the MCP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Forward Block are moving ahead to join the Trinamool Congress.
Welcome to the trinity of qualified leaders of any party.
The change of party of Congress councillors in Sanitia Municipal before the November 22 elections of five municipalities is considered to be important in political turmoil due to the possession of trinamool on the municipal board.
Earlier, the left wing is also an example of holding Trinamool on the Congress-ruled Municipal Board in Haldia and Nadia.
When Trinamool is taken over by the Municipal Board in the districts due to change of party, those who join the party are very welcome at Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to join the trinamool party by breaking away from other parties.
He said, "Welcome to the trinity of those who break away from any party.
He claims that people's faith is growing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, resulting in people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the MCP, has said that low-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and threatened.
People fearing the terror of the Trinamool Congress are joining it.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen by the CCP as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its population, but it is permissible to question the justification for changing the vote in the form of power.
Australian woman appeals against Thailand's jail term in jail
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Fuket provincial court found Steve Russell Bombford guilty of falsely accusing the Thai police of trying to stop him from driving a local taxi driver together with two other persons on the morning of June 10.
But later the C.C.T.V. footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel in a safe manner after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
He was allowed to make a story after being interrogated by the Fuket police for two days.
Before the hearing in the court, he was placed in the local police cage.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at the Centre for Low Security Resilience in the outer area of Fuket instead of a prison with adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has applied to the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family is "extremely concerned" about his daughter's care and they want to call her back to Australia.
"Certainly this has been a worrying time for us, but we hope that she will be home soon," Tunks said.
Bamfod has appealed against the sentencing order, and bail has been obtained on 50,000 runs.
Meanwhile, a report in Australia said that she was celebrating holidays at a place to celebrate a crabby holiday in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said the case of Bamford was being fought by a local lawyer in the fuket but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in adult prison.
By the way, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Fuket, Thailand may also be acquitted in an attempt to improve its bad tourist image.
