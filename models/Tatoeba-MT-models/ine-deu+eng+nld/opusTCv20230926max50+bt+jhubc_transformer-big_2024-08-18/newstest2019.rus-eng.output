The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbas has been named
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), Andrey Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3,000 recruits to the Donbas.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans to "at least somehow replenish the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to low staffing of units," said Marochko, who is quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev started the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force operation (JTO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to a strengthening of the role of the Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities described the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
U.S. officials have forced Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla's board
U.S. businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors at the request of U.S. authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $20 million and leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is clarified that the agreement still has to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders with a statement about the availability of sufficient funds to buy back shares of this company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
It is about the publication of a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 a piece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company’s shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, then the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only aggravate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said the Brexit talks had stalled.
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK’s withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained of a failure in the work of the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after an update that came out on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by his username
The complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in the Swift language.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor’s claim to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user upon receipt of the relevant court decision.
Telegram audience after the blockade in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Masku will have to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the position of head of Tesla.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be required from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is on the list of the 50 richest people of the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of space corporation SpaceX, neurotech company Neuralink and electric car developer Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was set “due to the importance of this number in marijuana culture,” Bloomberg said, citing Stephen Pekin, co-director of the commission’s security department.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently renounced his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considered the allegations of fraud unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way,” the businessman told CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts brought them losses.
In particular, one shareholder said the businessman’s tweets were misleading, prompting Tesla stock sellers to buy papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk’s careless statements led to sharp course fluctuations.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of the research company Citron Research of exchange machinations.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be threatened with dismissal from the company’s management and even jail.
This was stated, in particular, by the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is “a good guy who doesn’t know how to run a car company.”

In the RPC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OECD) of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan Volokolamsky Hilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Volokolamsky Hilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, possible ecclesiastical schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage", to rename the church is like in fascist Germany "to pin a yellow six-pointed star on the Jews".
"This means to mark the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on Russia 24.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
UOC urged Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory

The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of the Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans for 2024, but I don’t think that’s possible at that time.
I think there are more realistic deadlines over the next ten years.”

According to the vice-premier, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship for motor racing in the "Formula-1" class.
I know that there are motorsport enthusiasts in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team.
“We are willing to support them morally.
We hope that such a team will come to us.
I suspect that the thoughts of creating a team appeared, including because in Sochi, such infrastructure appeared.
Tomorrow, Sochi Autodrome is waiting for the enslaughter.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications the stands were practically filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year has increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to increase the efficiency of the use of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will add an even greater appeal to Sochi.
Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
"We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success next season," Izvestia said.
He is a very hopeful rider.

Although the future fate of Sergei Sirotkin in "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Grand Prix of Russia.
We hope that next season our main drivers will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding personalities in human history.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, has changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases, previously considered incurable, - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Parisian newspapers wrote: "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous St Paul's Cathedral in London.
Where, by the way, our wife and I paid attention to this word-of-mouth Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few years later the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the Plaza de Toros de las Ventas race, the most famous Spanish matadors set up a monument to a man whose efforts saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the race.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all about it.

Trump says he is in love with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK almost fell in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of the resolution of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have repaired relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had started relations with the DPRK so much that they could not even call the country’s leadership – they just didn’t answer the phone.
At the time, the U.S. and DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "cruel" towards Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, their relationship has now improved so much that the leaders have “fall in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and is also closing military sites.
All this is due to the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nietzsche called for the "Moscow language to be replaced by Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children’s writer and fighter for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nicea, called for the expulsion of “Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this, she proposes a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
Nitsa shared her thoughts on “the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication Observer.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, before on television and radio, Russian language was widely used, but in public space it is practically not left.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue a Watsons bookstore network, one of which spoke to her in Russian.
Unable to achieve her goal, Nitsa threw the girl's surrender.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians “language schizophrenia,” urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of the employees with each other in Russian, she committed a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
They had a male conversation during the break, and it was fruitful.
Ural defender Denis Kulakov - about the victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think led to victory?"
"It seems to me that we wanted to win more," Kulakov said on Ural's official website.
"Such a difficult game turned out, during the break they had a serious male conversation, and it brought its fruit: they scored two balls and did not miss.
“You missed a few games because of the damage you received earlier in the month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you’re going for 90 minutes, it’s okay.
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day a little bit of strength so that nothing happens.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
“What about the atmosphere in the team?”
“It’s no secret that after winning and recovering it’s easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Did you miss the game for the time you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's something that I've missed a bit, because really, an unpleasant situation has come out.
But I will say it again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and cheered the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

In the referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station in the elementary school "Lazo Angelovski" in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and tranquility, insulted citizens and attacked police.

We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting," the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said.
During the referendum on Sunday, citizens were asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic on June 17 during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should resolve not only a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was almost absent in a negative way
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, believes that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly is successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in the solution of global global problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric that we have already almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been somewhat more muted,” the senator said in an interview published Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes “described as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this rank, at least, a fairly common, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which is on this account.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the theme of Russia was practically absent in a negative way”.
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not completely accurate," - drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall, about which the puddles are trained.
The head of the specialized committee of the Council does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three."
“I do not rule out that the current session may be reversible in some sense,” Kosachev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how with the connection of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he added.
This is because, he believes, there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of today".
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we’re going through a point where movement is no longer a backward movement, it’s a forward movement,” he said.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "the request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, the Russian view of what is happening in the world is not the same.
According to him, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the lack of problems of the Middle East, the shortage of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East and the Middle East".
"And here the demand for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he believes that in this sense, "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record in popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
It seems that the Germans have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent social polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, AdG broke another record, climbing to the second line in the ranking of popular sympathies.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popular vote, managed to circumvent the Social Democrats, with about 16 percent of them.
The one percentage point gap can be attributed to statistical error, but it is not to be noted the fact that the AdG created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists has managed to turn into a serious political force.
The overall leadership continues to hold the CSU/CSU governing bloc, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48% of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7% lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation issues.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of the EU’s weak economies, did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country’s complete exit from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the AdG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took a niche of Eurosceptics and began to vehemently criticize the government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.

They believe in television and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been vaccinated with a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to struggle with literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as many as 201 editions.

The Death Term of the Universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
A study by an international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The researchers came to similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, the scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the European Space Telescope's Planck data recorder clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of <0xCE><0x9B>CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the observed world ending in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gatsby.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The opportunity to know the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday held a meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different formulations of issues (in total, the Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-Centre-
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of not increasing the age established by the legislation on pension insurance as of July 1, 2018, after reaching which Russian citizens are entitled to the appointment of an old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally embossed.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy".

The head coach of "Ak Barsa" Zinetula Bilaletdinov summed up the results of the match of the regular KHL championship against "Admiral" (4:2).
"It was a difficult game, a difficult one.
The opponent fought well, created great problems for us.
I’m glad we played well today in the majority.
I already said that someday the naked will come, the main thing is that we work on it.
It’s also very important that we win.”
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
“We have a program that he works on.
Therefore, there was such a decision," the club's press service quoted Bilaletdin as saying.

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbin's mistakes spilled out like from the horn of abundance
Former all-Union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Akhmat" and dissected the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the referee Eugene Turbine in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his unfitness for the judging of matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the efforts in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartacus" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI have made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private skips of rough receptions poured out like from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the train Edera drops with the help of his hands in his penalty area defender "Ahmata" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbine does not put penalties.
- How do you rate the episode involving Ido, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball fell into his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbine was next to the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was also to be seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and no penalty was appointed.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was denied.
It was the same case when the judiciary by concept displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not decide to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did I have to show the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbine and the first yellow card showed not exactly on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match on double standards of refereeship that some teams are penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
- Considering what you mean by double standards.
There were penalties.
They didn't give it.
So the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
Here played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Ahmata" has serious claims to the work of Turbin, because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the accused in the rape of Judge Kavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon has played Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at Senate hearings on the charge of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court previously drew attention to his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but has stated that he has never been drunk without a memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Kavanaugh stated that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments also defeated Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with this,” said Judge Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh was previously elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behaved completely differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a cotton-de-tulear named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are involved in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. thinks about Russia’s naval blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States can start a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities have so fiercely engaged in the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia’s maritime blockade, which remains one of the world’s leading suppliers of energy.
On the possibility of a maritime blockade the day before, the head of the U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs not police but civilian functions, including implementing natural resources policy.
Therefore, the statement of Zinke came into the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to U.S. naval forces, the U.S. controls sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington’s desire to impede Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in this region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to tighten Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be delivered to serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the General Director of the Zhukovsky Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute Kirill Sypalo.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
“We feel it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine that allows transportation through the spaces of our homeland,” Sypalo added.
He clarified that now before the Russian specialists is the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the developer of aviation equipment PJSC Tupolev announced the completion of pre-project work on the supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to develop speeds up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director General of the enterprise Valery Solozobov.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He said this on CNN.
He said he can only confirm the words of a Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin’s aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.
In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, the accession to NATO supported 16% of Ukrainians.
This is now more than 54%.
Who did this?
-Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, joining the EU supported 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did that?
Putin,” Poroshenko said.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire," the President of Ukraine stressed.
As the “FACTS” wrote, at the end of September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and participated in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
In Russia there is a club that I follow.
Former Chelsea captain and England national team John Terry - about why visited the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartacus" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
“I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I’ve been watching it recently and it was interesting to see it from the side.
I cannot say that I am a fan, since my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again want to apologize for the decision made," Terry said.
Recall that "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" was placed in the fifth line, having an asset of 15 points.

An expensive violin was handed over to the pawnshop for priceless
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpretentious instrument.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an ancient and expensive tool, and turned to an expert for advice.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250,000 dollars.
Only bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who sold it to the pawnshop, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin into the pawnshop will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are faced with an exciting confrontation: "Spartacus" will host "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valeri Karpin - a man, as you know, not a stranger to the "people's team".
The special spiciness of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-flung Zenit and being in one point from Krasnodar, who tomorrow plays with Dynamo.
The red-and-whites now have a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew into Rapido, and recently gave up at home to Ahmat.
After a derby with the CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak with a minimum score and not without difficulty defeated the Black Sea Cup, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia is close to coming out of the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three games in a row, but he does not know the defeats already five matches.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win series with such a principled match for himself.
The previous meeting between Rostov and Spartak ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00.
Indonesia shaken by aftershocks after powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake that triggered a three-metre tsunami occurred a few days ago, meteorologists have observed more than 170 aftershocks.
Magnitude was 7.4, mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, reports the TV channel "Russia 24".
More than 420 people were killed and more than five hundred were injured.

So far, the fate of dozens more residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday on one of the embankments of the city of Palu, which was most exposed to destruction after the earthquake, is unknown.
London has been hit by accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, UK Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at a congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are acting in gray areas with the help of cyberattacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is held on joining the EU and NATO, subject to the change of the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
One of the first voted Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a strong supporter of the renaming of the republic to North Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the monitoring mission of the Bureau of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled across the country to monitor the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then counting votes and drafting protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Faye Dulgery: “About 500 foreign observers are watching the voting closely.
The observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions to then present them in the final report.”
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in understanding each other.
This was told on the International Translator’s Day, September 30, by professional translator-synchronist Barbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "long hang on, go fast."
But it seems to me that for the understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Saxony noted, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "tying up relations" with Russia and supporting them.
According to her, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin mania.

Vladimir Putin has liberated Alexander Manjosin from the position of head of the President’s foreign policy department.
Instead, Igor Neverov was appointed to this post.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the President’s foreign policy office since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure, a source close to the Kremlin called personal circumstances, noting that in terms of the quality of the work to the head of the management there were no significant claims.

Russians donated one ruble to a low-wage deputy
In Yekaterinburg, the charitable foundation "Chelovechek" opened a fundraiser for the deputy of the State Duma Vera Hansi, who complained about the low salary.
The progress of the campaign can be tracked on the organization's website.
“The Charitable Foundation “Human” expresses the hope that we will be able to save the servant of the people all over the world.
We ask all indifferent people to give a chance to life and a happy future!
All funds collected will be transferred personally into the hands of the poor.
“God save you!” he said in a statement.
In total, the benefactors want to collect 380,000 rubles for the deputy, which is equal to the salary for a month.
The reports of the assistance received are published on the fund's page in "VKontakte", where the organizers display screenshots of money transfers.
The most common amounts of donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication of the notes, the Russians donated Vera Hanse 1633 rubles.
The fundraiser was opened on September 28 after Hansi complained about low incomes.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy is 380,000 rubles, of which nothing is left, so you have to spend funds from a credit card.

Valery Belov: God helped "Siberia" today
The head coach of "Vityasya" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The colleague talked about the fans of Siberia, and I want to celebrate our fans," - says Belov the official website "Vityazya".
“I hope they will support it as well, because now almost every game is full of stadium, great atmosphere.
In the game, God probably helped the Siberians today, because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the 0:3 micro match to our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull this match out, although there were moments.
But I will still take the blame on myself.
'Cause we've probably missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team.”
“This is disgusting nonsense.”
Viewers are outraged by Agutin's choice on the show "Voice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the teacher Leonid Agutin of "absurd cunning and brazen understatement".
When in the blind auditions he knew from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and will not turn to the performer.
But the sonly feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
At the time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher’s lack of objectivity in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father took the place of more dignified performers absolutely unjustifiably.
And now the spectators are no longer ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the spectators of the show, were outraged by the disgusting and frankly dragging of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I had even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the very end already to the first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "smelted" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the viewers still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all so, viewers want an objective evaluation and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the Voice from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.”
"The competition has lost its meaning."
“To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project a father who does not sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?”
“I like the way Dad sings, you can give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
“It was unprofessional on the part of Agutin.”
“Then you have to offer your own show to perform to your dad, not to a show that’s done for the money of Channel One.”
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut merged with a magnificent voice and timbre, and Papa Agutin brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Because I don't want to go through the squat!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Around mud and mud.
Money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at blind auditions came out the son of Gradsky.
Then the meter and in the head did not come to take the son in his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

Sergey Sirotkin: I could not do anything, and it was very painful
The Russian driver "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race Grand Prix of Russia.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I was between the two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, right away.
It turned out to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us get to the pit stop, we will get into the "clean air" and the pace will return, but the rubber was no longer there.
Plus, he fought with a partner, he had contact with him too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We were in this situation on the most unbeatable track of the season, I couldn’t do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Orotkin told RIA Novosti.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Grand Prix of Russia finished 18th, the winner was the British driver "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpisev called the absurd removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the foundation of "Spartak"
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of footballers of Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrey Eshchenko from training with the main team after chalking on the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport Weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is unworldly stupidity.
I completely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the dissension in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be a badass.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko like it, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
This is not good for the team’s normal climate.
Today Spartacus has no game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
"Spartacus" a lot is not in order in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction into the composition of the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match," - is sure Tarpishev.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously rejected Spartacus, led the Chelsea youth team.
The students of "Sirius" discussed with scientists natural-like technologies
Students of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of agrobiology and plant genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary “Kurchatov Codes”, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, correspondent member of the RAS Mikhail Kovalchuk talked about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website "Sirius".
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technologies require a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help natural technologies, which today young scientists are working on.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also talked about the risks that inevitably arises when creating such technologies.
“The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth of medical technology, this is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is the other side.
The development of natural technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of the systems of living nature.
There is a reverse side - targeted intervention in the life of a person.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
The cars are still being used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," the scientist quoted REN TV as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, the Head of the NBIKS-Natural Technologies Complex of NIC "Kurchatovsky Institute" Yulia Diakova and the Head of the NBIKS-Technologies Complex of NBIKS-Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the work of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympics on information security "Cyberchallenge" will be sent to training in "Sirius".
Air traffic controller saved the cost of life of the plane with passengers during the earthquake in Indonesia
In Indonesia, they said goodbye to air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who saved hundreds of passengers of Batik Air at the cost of their lives.

Agung refused to leave the command and control tower and helped the plane get into the air.
When the magnitude of the fluctuations reached 7.4, the tower began to collapse.
The 21-year-old controller had to jump from a height of four floors.
When he fell, he suffered serious injuries to his internal organs, and the doctors were unable to save him.
Russian submarine "Kazan" scared the United States
The biggest danger to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
U.S. Rear Admiral Dave Johnson said this, reports "Rosbalt" citing The National Interest.
“We are threatened by a severe potential opponent.
It is enough just to look at Severodvinsk," he said, pointing to the predecessor model Kazani.

Macedonia: referendum was not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje on the renaming of the Balkan country to "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to Macedonians using the name of its historic province.
The renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic meant opening the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of Sunday's attendance at the plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of an advisory nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of the name of the republic, said that if there is more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia will change the name, despite the quorum not reached.

Kemerovchan infuriated a flock of lambs in the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that in one of the local cemeteries freely walk cattle.
The animals passed between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory from weeds and weeds, but some of the residents of the city did not have the behavior of animals.
“These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing the rams can do there.
About rams, of course, you will not say that they harass, but it is not a matter of this." (style preserved) - said in her message an angry Kemerovskaya.
Either way, one of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pressing and sufficing - how right?
Words of pressure do not exist.
That's right, enough.
The word "press" in the meaning of "to exert, to exert, to exert" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to satisfy".
We use that word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "fulfill" etymologically not only are not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
To endure (church-book, obsolete) - means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure, pleasure are related words.
In the past, it had the meaning of "to depend on nothing, to have a self-satisfying meaning" - "to satisfy oneself".
The Old Slavic word "do<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>ti" is related to the words "to weep" and "will".
Suppression and suppression are completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squeezing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to trouble".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "fulfill", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]let", which is also used in the letter through "a", which is, well, incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of emergence and development of these words.
That's right, enough.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press.”
You can also use the “pressure display” design, but remember it’s an office space.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria killed about 100,000 terrorists, of which 85,000 terrorists destroyed the air and space forces of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the Air Force, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air strikes: the air and space forces have inflicted and continue to inflict all strikes precisely on the objects of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years – we are talking, for example, about ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the promotion of the government troops of Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jebhat al-Nusra (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And we are only talking about registered persons, except for those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on long-distance borders - otherwise this evil would "flow to us".

The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to the terrorists” as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “sowing chaos, death and destruction in its path.”
The foreign minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost finished, and the country has become more safe and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in restoring the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of Enemy Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft had struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. has denied all allegations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary’s issuance of its passports in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that is said to the Foreign Ministry," the President said.
According to FACTS, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo.
They swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor’s Office of the Transcarpathian region initiated a criminal case on the fact of issuing passports to Hungary.
The incident is classified under the article "State treason".
Putin has secretly flown to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
The data on the flights of the Russian "Board No. 1" on the website Flightradar indicate that about 6 pm Tajik time on September 28, Il-96-300 flew from the airport Dushanbe and took a course to the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the airliner could have flown to Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 news agency, the president was personally met by the head of the region, Viktor Zimin, on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the website sources believe that the real reason - "the problem of the second round".
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region will be held in Khakassia.
It included Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the acting head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov must take part Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia").
The Khakasian media suggest that Putin can accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new vice head of the republic, as well as make a decision about the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the start of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, primarily neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
According to Damascus, the military action is now nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Valid al-Muallem said: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and safe thanks to the success achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult for people and deprived them of livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to promote the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and European Union countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully acknowledged its guilt in the diesel car in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group’s losses are estimated at at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
By June of next year, the automaker is required to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said the commitments had already been met for 83% of cars, so the program would be completed early.
"Volkswagen" is trying to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of customers.
Thus, the management of the group has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was obtained by the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
“It is like putting a yellow star on a Jew in fascist Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created,” the Metropolitan said on the TV channel Russia-24 (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in the acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of law,” the priest believes.
“This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on the change of the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Deputy of the Holy Assumption Pochaev Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in the history of our ancestors and relatives in faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and defend their sanctities.
Given the situation that has arisen and the information that we have and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to experience something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The vice-chancellor of the Lavra also stressed that it is likely that "you will need your physical presence."
The priest added: “Lenin’s grandchildren are in the spirit of death, and therefore we will defend our sanctuary.”
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, must be ready to protect it, it is said in the address.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has the canonical status defined by Thomas of October 29, 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to introduce a dependence on the new-style patriarch and a friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," said the Mayor of Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC had been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican.
Those who believe in Him will be saved, and those who believe in Him will be saved.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes are shining on the temples that they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.
The club was evacuated after the bombing.
Employees of the Gazgolder club in Moscow were evacuated due to an anonymous call about "mining", the law enforcement agencies of the capital said.
Information about the explosive device embedded in the building has not been confirmed.
An anonymous call was received about the threat of explosion at: Lower Susal Avenue, 5, Building 26.
After checking the cynologists, the information was not confirmed," the source told RIA Novosti.
As the interlocutor of the agency specified, there were no visitors in the institution, the building left several employees of the club.
On September 18, about 100 people were evacuated from the building of the Moscow City Duma on Passion Boulevard.
The reason for the evacuation was also an anonymous call to law enforcement.
Information about the threat of explosion has not been confirmed.

You cling to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family," <0x40>nataliamama37 wrote.

What should be done not to make a victim?” <0x40>liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were also those who supported the singer.
"Oliver, don't be upset.
Your man will not speak loud words to the whole country and then just do not follow them," - Buzova <0x40>arina_prostyle.
"You're the queen and you need a king, and the one who turned you into papers just doesn't deserve you.
Get your nose up and move on,” <0x40>kreszentia_f wrote.

He decided to spend all his money on charity.
If we continue to play well, the victories will come.

"The good game was interesting, although it went to the goal" - says Vorobyev the official website "Automobilist".
“We tried to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent helped us a little, we stood.
But the removals gave us a little bit of "feeding."
The guys played great, did a coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play well, the wins will come.
Not scored, with zero goals the game does not win, but the content of the game itself was correct.
“Happiness will come if we continue to play in that direction.”
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“Then there was no foreign team.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"Automobilist" is a good good team.
On the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

Macedonia's main opposition leader refused to vote in a referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party "The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christian Mickoski said that there will be no vote in the referendum.

This was announced by the press service of the European Commission on September 30.

U.S. increases production of opioids in Afghanistan
Much has been said about the sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the Afghan territory, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans have died," Patrushev said.
The troubles in Afghanistan started not long ago.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which is based in Afghanistan.
Not a month has passed since the United States and NATO allies launched Operation Indestructible Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the life of peace is even more phantom than it was then.
U.S. troops are being chased by the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy back from the militants for money - only if they do not touch them.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - in the movement "Taliban" (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in Russia).
That’s why they grow there fast.
The goal of creating a barbaric pseudocaliphate in Central Asia is exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America, I think, seems to be doing it.
The fact that in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiate) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in opium poppy-sown areas and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in the name an attempt on the same name.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is given the right to a better future, a hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot make absolutely everyone happy.”
The renaming of the country is supported by the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country's president George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is forced from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
