At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange flipped into the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the start of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the US financial sector, is noticeable here too.
Fall of stock in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indicators managed to clear some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during the exchanges, but later it erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The Bloodbath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
Legislators thus denied the call for support for President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices experienced the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress cedes: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House’s banking and financial regulation committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial corporations the unsellable real estate assets that lead financial corporations to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we’re in it,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure that Congress reaches a final deal as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading begins in the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could affect Monday’s trades.
At the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations will not be blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will continue to undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be made available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option of blocking the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funding for the purchase of bad real estate securities, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed to the vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George W. Bush is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors from losses, the settlement agreement, and the timeline of the plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners, who have problems paying for it.
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of the buyback of the troubled assets will be.
This point will be decisive for deciding on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is not, according to Marek, as important as this.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at the moment," Marek said.
A push to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones know how to play MP3 files, no MP3 player knows how to phone.
As a result, it seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl record, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you are at least likely dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music on the go, that is, compressed music, to put it simplified - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to support headphones bought for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and SMS sending, it is able to play music and movies, to record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
There are few mobile devices that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are significantly better performers.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this being true even for more expensive devices.
This problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of recharging, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
Music can, of course, be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers are able to do so without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobiles.
As for the drives, you do not need, except (iPod), any software.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or by the user's judgment.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, while others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, you are especially interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of ordering.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobile devices are now capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
All manage to play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical mobile.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is, in most cases, limited to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still wear their mobiles on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, all you have to do is get the phone out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have on you headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which almost all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and better equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to control the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away with even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the convenience of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
- Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we are still missing something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network apparently no longer has much luck (by the way, now it would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which, subsequently, the traditional operators also had to react.
Yet, even before party troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as Mobilking’s example in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
In fact, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work in our country as well.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, the spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most of the virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not for a long time concealed its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“Right now, we don’t believe there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
At the moment, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 press department said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement right now.”
Instead, Vodafone focuses on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared fees and infrastructure.
This, in our opinion, means the most contributions from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities: in step with the operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
So what good is it to facilitate the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along like fairgrounds. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
However, today, U:fon can be used as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted in this regard: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not only about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented enough interest for conventional operators," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS clarified in response to our question.
Such a statement would not be surprising on the part of the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially since Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, pressing for fair market functioning and lower prices is apparently not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, whether this is really a coincidence, arises naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the fierce fight of the competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
One of the many points of disagreement is the interpretation of the dominant position in the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Taking back responsibility for the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not succeeded, although many experts have promised an improvement.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one is watching, it can work.
That said, the operation of some sort of pseudo-virtual operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but the latter are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer customized mobile phone services.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company makes in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
“If this were to happen, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would consider and that could lead to a termination of the collaboration with the company in question,” said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, opposes such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them significant profits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
This is exactly what should seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question arises at <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms prohibit it.
When We Are No Longer the Most Expensive Country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, the classical operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue in the manner of a hot potato, which is removed by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experience we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the knock.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear in our house, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS can hardly remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensively than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC3><0xBD>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the hymn arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good saying, so that one can understand the lyrics well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC3><0xBD>j retentit for the first time in 1834 on the planks of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse of the savers), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Prague Transport Agency (Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podr<0xC3><0xAD>k) as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> vrhn<0xC3><0xAD> (the Transport Agency), located in the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC4><0x8D>a, Le<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozty
As of yesterday, it is also possible to buy coupons via the Internet on the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podn<0xC3><0xAD> webpages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had until now to trample impatiently into long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be recorded on their Opencard in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket office with trained staff, which will help those interested with online purchases and, in addition, record the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to save electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compost the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
A vending machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> integrovan<0xC3><0xA1> doprava (integrated transport from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the tickets Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the public transport in Prague.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with integrated card readers in the driver’s box.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In the event that the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the expiration date of their voucher, can again join the vending machines, initially used to save the vouchers on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudeten demanded a referendum in the United States
The Sudeten Germans demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States in 1945.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> scient<0xC3><0xAD>eck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some Sudeten German groups allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> s<0xC4><0x9B>dieck<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov in the letter asked the American president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA0>umavsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and we want to be really sure that the words proclaim that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed "Persons, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is dear".
Given that the connection to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, ruthless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter now ask the American president to take into his hands the protectorate for the <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or live under the patronage of the US.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would gain a certain type of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him for him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they got home, the Czech would be profitable for them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign, which costs 150 million euros, will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and from alcohol at the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
This is also evidenced by the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is capitalized on the registration plate.
Then, in a pile of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay with life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents can be commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with the drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when grilling a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Signs signaling danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably merge with the environment quickly and drivers will not notice it anymore," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke out in favor of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, or even all of them,” Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians an analogous percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made,” he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city in July.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later said.
Golan Heights Retreat
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan Heights retreat," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), of Al-Qaeda (Prime Minister), as well as of Iraq (the jihadist network).
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the trip.
"If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing seating equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance Student Agency buses have no standing seats; this has been confirmed in Aktualj.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription deals with that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," Hanzelka added with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
“It all depends on whether the bus is allowed to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher permitted speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Nor is it certain when turbulence will occur and the air hostess may hit her head."
"But in the event that the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
The same way as in a city bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal regulations," he said, adding that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade as a risky trade.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and logbook at boarding.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason given by the absence of stewards in his vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposed to them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who has been working for the company for two years, died in the crash on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he slipped it by his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the works for more than a year, by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details about the movements of stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, noting that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the office for occupational safety.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be constituted, according to the letter released Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "competence block" doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive impetus for other concentrations in the Landesbank sector.
This is what it looks like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under strong pressure.
Not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now there has been a question - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Deta-Bank chief Franz Waas said at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings bank groups, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct negotiations with the WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the Financial Place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees counts as one of the most important employers on the Frankfurt financial market, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate bank and Halbab.
However, nothing has emerged from this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the Government of the Land of Hesse opposed Hellaba's participation in them.
After that, the other two houses did not join either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was instead attached to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of the Deka-Bank with banks from Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba board, had, however, opposed any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Despite this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land bank could become a reality first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers was to increase, the potential partners are gradually escaping it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it had hitherto better withstood the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings and transfer group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain in place.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which business model should ensure the future capacity of the Landesbanks, had not yet been resolved by the German savings and transfer grouping.
In the long run, a decommissioning of the WestLb could take place, decommissioning which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is referred to in the letter of the incumbent Steering Committee: in any case, a <0x60>global solution' would be targeted for the establishment.
How all this will be put into the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds its goosebump can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della berra', arrival scheduled at 06:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses Brazilians travel exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing bears and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And so noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For five years, they have been going to the beer party, already three fired just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome jar with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Brixen, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates will once again pause shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty as planned on the parking lot near the Place Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: hairstyle the little yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left <0x60>F<0xC3><0xAA>te de la beer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
“When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,” cried Marco in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, if not blocked, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room!"
The chop, cried Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
<0x60>Show the security officers that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: <0x60>Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half o'clock!' Understood?
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone knots yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'Italian Weekend'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapse into the beer booth, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is especially appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word “relatively” and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This was indeed the case this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from the turbulence of the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from private banks as much as from public-law banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa subsidiary that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself very short-term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible due to the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity rate had also weakened slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
On-going and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero over the same period last year, with profits from the allocation of determined debts and securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations falling by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies of the Konzern that the deficit of the gains was reduced by about 16 per cent.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had first mis-speculated on industrial real estate loans, which had then been affiliated to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private-public-partnership (PPP) projects and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which still remains rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a very important state and infrastructure investor.
It is more robust than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the inter-bank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has again been considerably slow, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing for some of Depfa's total credits - around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion - annually.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of the largely out-of-state international financial markets at the moment.
Other sources say that refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Establishment (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group’s market capacity is now secured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have nothing but to hope for.
However, given the dynamics and imbalances of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still on the doorstep of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue at least provisional will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The share price collapsed from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, perform particularly well.
While debt in the first place has barely moved, the prices of second-hand loans are declining.
The most affected are, of course, the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those with a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the backlog will be resorbed over time.
Or else it will happen what no one dares to expect right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability approaching security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should primarily reserve insomnia nights for long-term creditors on deciding whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they drew a line on to constitute a loss deferral for the next few years on the next automatically levied capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What's that supposed to mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I so excited about?
The way to go to school scares me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as in our country in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after another from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low Masses, laughed and did signs, and I constantly heard the word “Kawaii.”
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "nice, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone was talking to someone better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all released their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things have a weird look and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I wonder if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga is what I’ve loved for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he feels fear too?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without which I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general consciousness, we enter difficult-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our experience subjective to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the directional and executional functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least so for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being linked to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, due to this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses us with great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is next to it another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also emphasizes the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does it mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its aftermath, like the reactions of the body) takes over from the vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, arise because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex and brainstem body sensation, just like Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could have been fully involved in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe this is undemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: however, how could one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
True, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brainstems, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove it for Man, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the nervous plane, as the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hit a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatist.
Platini, UEFA president: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslav Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer from this."
Several members of the Premier League were already convicted of manipulating compulsory relegation in the previous season; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview – and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adult Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attacks.
A Late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in an unfortunate battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her being described as an infidel husband fell clear: it would be “Monstrous,” he told the New York Daily News, 54, that “Meg once again refutes the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be even more "regrettable" that "the pain and upheavals of a divorce for each child will be revived again in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his answer to the claw: "In any case, my life goes on.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
The prices of plane tickets and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reasons for all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar exchange rate that led to a “descending travel envy of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by falling hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economy class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even split by two, according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, a weakening economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
The Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only got into the game late and his shot shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need that second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the arena in Hamburg.
There was not much going on in the locker rooms, the half-time was over and most of them had had enough in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
“Not everything was very nice to see today,” Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted to be more relaxed too".
This 1:0 (1:0 at halftime), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful header by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win," Marin Jol said.
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is certainly slowly forming, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index cost 10,579 points with a decline of well over five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffett had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that can be exchanged in line with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Aspiration stock prices in the tourbillon in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not bode well for investors’ concerns.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the state’s bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of the Bavarian real estate financier has so far lost three-quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has reported a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government’s $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart the financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of opening.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index posted a drop for the moment of 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index jumped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor’s shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers puzzled: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel pipelines, death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way they are expected to according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt are expected to be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have said in concert.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert tour should already be on their way to Cairo.
Circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: The kidnappers were reportedly close to ending the abduction, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without yelling at the station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be returned by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the story.
Abuses of a stepfather that led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight heads of charges for indecent acts.
Truro’s grand trial court ruled that he regularly tied his stepdaughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional letter: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her before forcing her to have sex, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an assiduous National Trust volunteer, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father, who had also written a confession letter that concluded: "I attached and bandaged her regularly".
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim had to be definitely terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly highlight, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office minister who had forgotten top-secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Defense Department man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have stayed between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the backup of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Secret Service Committee
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B bill.
British building companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” to know that companies and their members would have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But interest, which will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
There is a proclamation that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, general director of the building companies' trade committee, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovery of the real estate market must now pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at every aspect of this case over the next few weeks to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could also double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per litre
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by five pennies per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a search conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied in 2002.
A former PM from Bangladesh has been denied bail.
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is likely to be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because she was questioned for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail as she had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to be treated abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations they are the subject of.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses ITV 's Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Competition Commission’s verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss Richard Branson, a consumer group, and regulator Ofcom all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
This was the result of the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some departmental officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
“Serious, unfounded allegations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began in December 2006 with the removal of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting legal proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of departmental officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf should be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The evening of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and was sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat that became irregular after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don't know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet wide to 120 long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to reclaim Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to the stores and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, have said they are charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the city’s Department of Conservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlord committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal allowing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
“There are few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place,” she said.
“They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the builder will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn't necessarily mean it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's primary interest is to re-look this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The posterior entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, shackles, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be shut down in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat runs agile down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he thought some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have been in dark, damp and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think. Why Middle Classes Should Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports among so many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire for bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 Math State Examination, expert level.
Similarly, nearly 93% of students passed the English-of-Languages-of-Arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that developed by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Shouldn’t Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up of mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the education policies within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its huge support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue to be insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
“On the contrary,” he said, “you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than dismissing them or considering them as insignificant.
Net Oil Drop Following the New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets will succeed in reviving the economy.
Oil futures operations fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Stock Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After seeing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again worried despite the biggest bailout deal in history, which Congress leaders have reached this weekend.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the very latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, "seem not to have succeeded in reviving the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and in particular, in China.”
Analysts at the bank lowered their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The party of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Record of the Team.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone in the Jets' Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into the half.
"I didn't leave my zone," Favre said of all his passes at Coles.
“He is a mediocre player.”
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense beat Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
That was the best the Jets could score in a while.
The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third time?"
When he was told the two-the Jets passed 21 undisputed points in the third half- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of an accommodating race on the pitch, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the World Championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at departure, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won on Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to the marathon’s record drop of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I went back last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was reproached—especially in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia—for having over-orchestrated his races, avoiding the world marathon stars, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish line, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best five-minute record.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to participate in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skillful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18miles and a half later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City to Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and the complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts,, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no catches."
It has now become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes- has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little of us, doesn't know what he's losing".
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious from the outside.
“We’re very careful about how we tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of a black power takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - sometimes despised, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectical books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, that culminates in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Daring as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"Passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and those well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So in barely a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in the city without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he further adds, swinging in his chair from the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted a five-lane highway in the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixing of races led to hatred at the doors of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young white people were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the sidelines,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education as “insulting rather than glorifying of my race.”
Residents now claim that eliminating racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - our master was kissed in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and chief executive officer of Community Safety at Eatonville, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white professor because he’s white – I mean there’s a line of cultural demarcation here,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: “How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!”
It surpasses me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston Festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many return in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the county postponed the proposal for the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by saying, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (of course renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street back on a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are currently 90 percent blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
Permission is required for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who pass through this area there will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after the Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to look at history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently of finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the newsstand and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst “office day” since the 1929 crack.
The deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always hang between residential buildings wearing, like mules, some fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people queuing up.
Not in front of the cashier’s desks, or to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checks, tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” were all queuing up for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in a state, and that claim to treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 bank, turned to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 million in savings accounts, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that does the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her skinny CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge at my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries from my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning; according to police, this is an organized action.
Delinquents have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremists’ feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could have something to do with the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said it was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned against immigration and some of their slogans were even considered xenophobic, according to critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out right after the elections defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference because they were worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a ban on Glitter for six months, after he expressed to the authorities who have him under control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
Kent Police issued a travel ban on Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt for child sexual abuse to magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Courts of Limited Jurisdiction hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "Thursday, September 25, in the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even though he was on the list of sexual abuse suspects.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss particular cases or potential Glitter displacements in the county.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that are able to manage any potential risks much more effectively.
“Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have had to board for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, so he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, was going to the limited court of Uxbridge, West London, for the registered on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been serving a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of child abuse images.
A Interior Ministry source said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off-stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no fancy clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to achieve the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you do not need to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about the dance or the song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the “Portraits of old sportsmen” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment or less long.
In photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don’t know or that only give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at the number 20 of the Rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Hercules People's Square), which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "truly daring"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in the Congo and who has gone through the Amazon.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas and thoughts, which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants’ votes, filled the room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, has found himself in the face of an intriguing audience who has not seen his past partie during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live a new experience"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "doesn't make people go any less like it".
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banner party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horse riders verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather hardened on this fair, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
In the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the steps discovered applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin the escape.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, what to stop them from.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the lower side, where the two occupants descended to escape into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hash-balls and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "counterfeited" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The inmate, 28-year-old A. A. J., was placed in custody to carry out the various proceedings and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effect of a Drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California Police Patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "took a deep push on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to run a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former youth and sports adviser of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out family favors for members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Blood of Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour-long film Blood of May will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour-long TV series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci assures that he realized with this shooting "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of 2 May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the story was told to the nations.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was mistaken as the leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all of his career.
The filmmaker of "Back to Start" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since this seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater to inform himself and to the theater".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominee films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Blood of May", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not said to be more representative of the young cinema.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize you work only for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n takes on the role of the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer as well.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dancer.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "the dance of the snake" at some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers,” she says.
The staging was done thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta aperta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; to the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and to the collaboration of an actor who was considered to be Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez's's's co-gente, "who plays the
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work,” says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show will start at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Juan-March 2006" celebration of the "Juan-March" and "Juan-March 2006".
In this way, the "Triennate Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated in May and which, after having traveled to different provinces in New York, went to the Congr.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America would be better off without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who has worked with him on "Absence of Evil", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn’t been around since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of making themselves ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are fearful, the esteem of the Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only admiration left to human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the Foundation for Anti-Drug Combat created in honor of his deceased eldest following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put us on the high ground,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman has done: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not lack the opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In the sky, he proudly attends to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever raced.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination score.
But let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the buttocks, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the buttock (first mistake, moving only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small-sized shirts with less fabric and at the same time cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there were rebellions and raids on the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this would not come to my mind at all.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft presented a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to get to and from the company's campus).
Through a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen to and hear the keywords of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she is here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first step toward competing with Windows.
Many people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true. It's true.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed the idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who is using half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, busy months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, indeed, and I’ll show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being delayed and the iPhone already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the muscular gays association's outfit.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also cite this sturdy mustache that lifted weights in a walking circus.
This is not just a simple men's cotton bodysuit, molding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most famous bodysuits have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters, as well as at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the ' Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we are very much inspired by it for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
Dancers love to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
So everything is connected.
You didn’t have it 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me to, and I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the release of the films ‘La Ultima Hora’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't climb the bridge to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite some time, to invite me to attend a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
The good side of Naomi also fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear pie, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Recidivists of alcohol at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting intoxicated, or if it does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state, resume the car.
Alcolock would avoid this since it is a connected system on the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than authorized.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
It is precisely tomorrow that the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landing in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but his rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor so that he could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, all right, then we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... Are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and at a military rank composed of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when her own, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing through the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The Most Prestigious Fashion Award
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
It is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family as a neighbouring table, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on her heart and making good heart against bad fortune, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH garments, which took her breath away, and arms over it, arms under it with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she dreamed about Valentino.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rothschild ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself in the store with a pants and a shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a sexy long dress and black, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us the ball of the rehearsals, she showed us the ball of the rehearsals
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets and towels and having asked in advance, that there are no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The morning awakening almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it is even worse when we think of the hectic rhythm that current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga poses, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get peace of mind in places like work or through personal relationships, this “manual” denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one person talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (pissing in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitement situations.
In any case, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with screams, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that sleep talk becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleep talks appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advices
Don't wake him.
It is useless since he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he shows himself very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because while sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, this is nothing bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of starvation.
Without making a great match, the Yellow and Black have created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting Captain Kauffmann, who was firing the skyscraper at a distance, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Roman at the tip of his foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a repulsed ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illinois goalkeeper will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Illumination Eleven who has just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big fog, the ball passed very close to the crossbar.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who strongly disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet with their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the rise in gasoline prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the employment and remuneration conditions of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of nearly 10 km.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filter dam was put into operation on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, such as the Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where the trawlers stayed on dock, or the Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the consequences to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel oil less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film’s legend and the engaged actor, Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian airliner counts on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession that looms over the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to divest more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance business internationally and its retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
AIG's board of directors met Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to separate from include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, duly diluting the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) jumped 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive "too late".
“If the project is indeed dying ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution” to the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organised the buyout of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has sharply accelerated, pushing for emergency interventions in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell to 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year Treasury bond yield fell to 4.161%, from 4.357% the day before.
Obama wins points in first televised duel
In Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House, another was followed to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign CEOs proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that was reportedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that McCain’s performance, while honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to stem his decline in five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), says it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them awarded the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-host, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She’s got good instincts,” Clinton said this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to highlight his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent’s “naivety” on those issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said that he represents the future of the world.
Without disassembling, it proved concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama has,” a Democratic spot this weekend retorted, accusing the Republican of not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “street American.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a sweltering rain.
He didn’t even pronounce the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial meltdown clearly benefited Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the cliff.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that, despite the Wall Street upheavals, it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that achieving the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was its top priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates shunned issues related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as the polling stations in Minsk central square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What good, since they will do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has done the right thing for foreign observers in order to re-engage with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered proper by observers.
This was not the case according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the polls," said Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of 12 parties.
“This is a cosmetic change,” said Alexander Milinkievich, a former candidate of the opposition in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us, it is the executive power.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space for television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You noticed that there was an election, you?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
As Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Decary.
The situation was discouraging.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were observed in Europe, says the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when this is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, excution measures were introduced.
In April 1999, people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980 were denied blood.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated without a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests that allow the detection of the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The NATs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may become infected without knowing it and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmission by a blood product to occur.
I believe that we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the chief executive of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Decary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a boost in red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which on average comprises only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
However, anyone in good health who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is spreading, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today’s life is so frantic, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - L'Impact en demi-finale
Impact de Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, in the second and decisive quarter-finals match of the series total goals, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to outplay Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round of 16, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will play in the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder made up a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn spearheaded the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian at last night's Florida Panthers at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec picked up two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest bet on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get himself elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Removing the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the foreground, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, a sort of picture mill was projected.
They shot in a loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
A lot of money, like in the election period.
In a press release, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would trigger an election this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
It's not just our home, it's in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was calling for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
For the rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former parliamentarian from Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Plant in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
In the press, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, arousing applause at their homes.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which is what the law allows him to do.
He points out that his schedule is, however, filled, notably by a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the North Plan were greeted with skepticism.
The leader of Beijing, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to implement it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," Marois commented alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that takes place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
ADQ said it supports the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (ironically) in Harper's office, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To thus cast reproach upon this woman who has waged an incessant struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts he was accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier crumble in inhumane conditions.
The only one who resorts to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that is shutting its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” a word that Harper keeps whistling and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no morality anymore: you can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a minority head of government so far (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defenders in order to impose an amicable settlement that will rattle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was to public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally held through an exchange of ideas and not through a slash.
So it was enough for the mine to open its books, its records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and dismisses the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while contemptuous of the opinions of that same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word only refers to heavily paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does it primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not within the framework of what many perceive as a stalker prosecution (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, just filed a warning to the authors of Black Canada's use of this...
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to the citation of credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for academia, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better monitoring by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the leaders of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative to the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, following a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
"That's the fundamental point: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on Americans' daily lives will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned sprinting in the last few hours out of fear of the effect a new failure would have on investor sentiment.
The time limit we had agreed on was the opening of the markets this morning.
Associated late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather supportive of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that one is forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salary of executives of companies rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The broad lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky, and unsellable claims of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freeze in liquidity and bank failures.
It was a group of elected Republicans that overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that we have come out of this impasse since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corner for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to take losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its payout.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion, which can be added to 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will obtain stakes in the companies it rescues that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that it will be able to resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying seizure procedures for housing attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the executives of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington does not hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it is not about taking advantage of taxpayers.”
An animator of a small group in Congress dubbed "the skeptics' caucus", Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel Prize laureates, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully examine the way forward," he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing the acquisition of its competitor in full wreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the top 20 European banks and the top ten insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, one regains a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and households appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on the verge of nationalizing another bank battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take back all the loans underway at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time its card asset, some will say its weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday at the age of 83 following a lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the great years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate mark of quality.
Because in it was projected an entire country loved by the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actors Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, on television, soon to the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the second-placed driver at the 1979 Le Mans 24 Hours, doubled with a sex symbol, though a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the cracks of the show-business, whose riddle will not have been completely pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused the moviegoers to become dizzy this weekend, as his major roles on the black screen of memories collide.
More than half a century of a perpetually changing seventh American art parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's charming cowboy (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many more Paul Newman have gone down in history.
This boxer, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), a role for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic bastard in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Academy Award for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter billiards player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take over the character on Martin Scorsese's return to The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 for nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's back.
The eras are traversed through its course.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as patron of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who gave up the business early on, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendor and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too much supported.
The profession has not always been tender to the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the mouth.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginal ones: neurosed, alcoholic, slutty or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed facets poorly known for his true puddy sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday to Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drifts.
We will have seen a lot of his binette sit on jars of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process to be quite bad taste, albeit gag at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Childhood in Trouble.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag & Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings related to the ongoing criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having resulted in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been taken against them, such as false and the use of false.
According to the prosecution, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and the municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went into the treasuries of the Fiatal Baloldal movement on the one hand and on the other hand, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to raise money from subsidies obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured billbooks at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while they manufactured the stamps at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados, at the request of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for writing the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for as many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert Foundation, which would later bear the name Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there.
Excessively imaginative invoice issuers also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert nor that of the Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of the company, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The zealous invoice issuers also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies of their choice, but only arranged trips abroad, so naively they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, whereas travel services, which are destined outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp in the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ert was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of forms, such as inappropriate types of invoices and false seals, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and of Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this fact.
Deliberately Established Invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Ssocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, has established an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices on behalf of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Association.
There was no financial movement, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The following category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose registered office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt companies to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, and that he tampered with their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the acts of foundation of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov donated to organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The prosecutors believed that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into the pocket of Kubatov.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. company to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szovetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted an application for a grant to the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy in the amount of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes set out in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as she had done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be that the main defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably outraged, since applications for his placement in a supervised residence, on the basis of a relief of his detention conditions, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of over-tendering: why do we spend more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distanced in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay a price too high.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-tendering of a third, the whole under the brainstem, called the striatum, moved intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economist members of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups over-tendered against a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and so they carried out their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would come out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis in one was on victory, while in the other, on failure.
Proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the players' team "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena found during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories, now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: when should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that there are 100 miles of patients with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only 7 miles are treated, often because the patients do not know that they are the carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a bad general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then a visible jaundice develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become lighter and the urine takes on a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, one million people die each year from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakily destroys the cells of the liver. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Do those who believe in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence the tolerance of the human being to pain.
As part of this at least bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Through a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and scattering electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermione painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while watching either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe,” like someone they were “care for” and they “calmed down, and peace invaded them.”
In view of the religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they were watching Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith is expected to change and in many cases actually changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what effect would it have on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one showed to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consulted and what are their interests.
But that’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in society.
As for the skeptics paralleling Orwell’s vision of horror, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to be able to meet their original goal that sounded like, “Let’s gather all the world’s information in one system!”.
According to the Google executive questioned, after ten years of global chambuling work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
Asked what’s going to happen in five years, Schmidt said he’d like Google to answer questions like “What could I do tomorrow?” or “What’s the job that would work best for me?” However, software will only be able to answer that kind of question, simple at first sight, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages subsequently visited by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will provide us with pre-recorded statements of our products and services.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask the users, who are worried seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against the power that can arouse a backlash among Internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing for identification.
Human rights-minded Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, upside down with the electronic legal protection body EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be able to be compelled by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won compared to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it failed to obtain the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of last two months websites and keywords.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flogged by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the proud multinational companies of their image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savages" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, both cataloged as the same invader of the world, so beat the same because of Windows
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the package of programs, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is pulling right behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a tracking system, such as Flick's or Blip.fm's blogs. These young people can also keep them on their own.
While one can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at sight the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her infidel friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on his blog about a total of
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. The services of Google online, through the processing of text to the processing of images, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which have not yet existed, which are not associated with this standard.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding from it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing rate of non-important Microsoft developers cause serious problems.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the company's nursery and after the company has deemed too expensive the company has already made the daily multiple restoration.
According to one of the company's internal rules, our new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain, is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google's new system is going to take on so important dimensions that the company's
The fact that Google is setting up a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of sci-fi authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached effervescently only through Google’s data.
Two Minors Helped Disappear Traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s Double Murder
"The police have summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x96>zd. According to reasonable suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," - said the spokesman of the department of Borsod police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they have been accused of, and they are currently accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x96>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to MTI information, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of that.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles have made despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest bid that has been made to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, about 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of shares, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, which is worsening day by day, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at a speed, aiming to help in a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and then the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, the one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just at the moment when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored," said the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still give a lifeline to their hesitant financial organizations, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to make little use of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Vienna daily, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a way similar to the American in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from side to side.
The "saviors" should not immediately rake in a hundred billion euros, on the other hand, it would be wise if they noticed in which case it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car mimics the theft of the buzzer
What better method would it be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, held in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-driving robotic control system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality is very similar to our safe protective shell - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and public relations technology department of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, as it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an immediate avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
“If it weren’t for this, the mini car robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, only the rotary movement, acceleration and slowdown could be used as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrate is larger, which makes their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don't need a memory of a capacity of gigabytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance, and according to Nissan estimates, this system will make its way into mass-produced cars over the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of the box.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at buying up dubious credit from banks, and to be used multiple times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters announced that in the course of new debates extending until midnight on Saturday, local time on the east coast, congressional leaders agreed on the controversy that has been going on for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m. Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in response to the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, followed by its fate in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also hailed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
In addition, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent at once, for the purchase of securities on dubious credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy dubious claims from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Department will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will also be able to purchase dubious receivables, securities on dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
The competent persons of the ministry stated that the purchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Department guarantees the tools that cause the concern, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to dedicate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the extensive repurchase of dubious claims, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system collapsing from one major financial institution or another.
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for the implementation of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank executives in poor positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Salary caps are only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the business.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys out as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the repurchase of the dubious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the executives is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling concerns only the new contracts, this to motivate the participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in place regarding the appointment of directors-general - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President will have to submit a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be refunded to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayer dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague in Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks the same people are pushing for action as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors only experienced a slight increase of around 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with firstly, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then the production of shoes with a monthly increase of 2.5 percent.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical products and materials manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This led to deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent) and a slight increase in the wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the sectors of supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas put in place by the authorities since July 1.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the major food, beverage and tobacco production sector, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases have occurred in the textile and textile products (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacturing of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent from the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August, it was the initiating sectors of profit-on-investment that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-making sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our domestic means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and by 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement will come into effect around January 12, as the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the moment when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation."
At all times, it drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations starting today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McC.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major US parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements of principle on the bank bailout plan.
This funding plan, aimed at the thawing of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the focus on economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little bit ahead of himself. McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as the runner-up just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope for Congress to quickly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains consumer protection clauses that he also supports.
"It is now time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
McCain’s economic ideas have been described as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Board and the capping of senior executives' severance payments, and that he was personally very committed to these issues.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The Press Review of the German Language Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - that is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, says.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is the same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This epochal change is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party was over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the "parent-eating" modernization, which has been implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been greatly mistaken about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the rapidly developing Bavarian region could not go unpunished on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it has been the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as independents, artisans, holders of the bachelor's degree and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.

In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic politics that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> want to talk to the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP forbids the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> populist party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards glimpse.
Werner Faymann, chairman of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would envision a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted with caution to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be fruitless if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or joining the coalition is at the moment a completely open question. These points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP for the Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most children of Roma people.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that, in addition to the distinctions found in hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market, primarily as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not hold high school degrees, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction has the possibility of obtaining a higher education degree."
In addition, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Because of their nationality from the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a low quality and sectarian education," - emphasized L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the Member, the European Union's cooperation towards a goal and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools. For this, compliance with the existing and in preparation for the directives on anti-discrimination is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held every year since last year's summit in Berlin, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, both at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a Transition Period
It is in October that the decision will be made on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their seats.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it seem that they were not particularly fond of their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union gained 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria’s “only sovereign” giving 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the Conservatives still rely heavily on this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, has also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions at trial with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the right-wing Electoral Committee, formed by
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislation, whose taking action against Stroiber served as the possibility of a coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treats the very ambitious municipal politician without restraint.
Now the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued a few harsh remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor again until she is re-established in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not negatively affect Berlin’s grand coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) since then seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term of office for the fourth time, would change the term of office of President of Ukraine.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally intended boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the Russian-speaking country, where due to the Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive any entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition to the import of Belarus.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as a ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the polling.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia as separate territories from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been initiated," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remains so, although "the power in this parliament, which has no weight, was afraid to let even one opponent in".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to convey its message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we will have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities will put sticks in our wheels as far as broadcasting is concerned, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," he said in the main article, referring to Milinkevich.
"Due to the country's debt and rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace had there been any doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in effect against the little smarts, against whom points and then will drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The novelty against lazyness was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services,” says Brunetta.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“This is reformism,” Brunetta added.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is complemented by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of the revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees has been recorded, the secretary general says: "it is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or growing.
Brunetta’s promise, who suggests smilingly, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration Public
In Rome, the minister reports that “in three months, the absence of disease of public employees has decreased by 50%, that is, 60 thousand more workers in a year”.
And he adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration .
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today spreads data on the decrease in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the Association of Consumers - the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of stay at home of the sick worker, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favour of workplace prevention, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness"
Naturally indignant, everyone has punched in the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, due to their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, House Speaker Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly".
The data of the accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"We do not want this 'discount trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, not enough is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
“In our opinion,” Mercandelli said, “more checks and inspections are necessary, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the school.”
- He added- "that there is still a need to make an effort in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivation to which the system is oriented in recent years".
“The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneity or the expansion of the legislature.”
Mp3 player pointed with the finger, they put at risk the hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on unforeseen and recently identified health risks of the EU (Csserri), published today.
According to this scientific report, 5-10% of those who listen to music at full volume over a period of at least 5 years using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity.
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," Kuneva said.
"According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the EU executive-confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against similar exposure to noise from musical devices and portable devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it," Alemanno said, "it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome, which will be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announced the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is burdened by day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, to a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further, not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
“Obama is really slutty: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that say little; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern bowels of the United States wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to the point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these considerations, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What were the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weak spot.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murderer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly state to the attachments of information, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national-level journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are breaking into the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using the technology in the hope that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hurdle in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “safety at work.”
Directors who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are at 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STILL IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
At the trial in his charge last week, he had obtained home release transformed into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the provincial city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this by telling us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its former East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washingtons" and to the world of finance in the South, especially powerful in the South.
The soul, in fact, which made itself felt despotically with the vote of which I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake foretells or already lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and maybe not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena covered for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation really seems out of the question, or does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, is divided between the various interests and between the various national strategies, and does not manage to decide on any common policy line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection for credits: when you go through a difficult period, there are only those states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no international market or organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, after all, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attach to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, when we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will, on the contrary, have to pay more and more taxes.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but that are absolutely related to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proven inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a sense, even troubling: a discredit, a suffering, a picture of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds in an underground way, has a powerful and branched movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the "revolts" improvised electoral right or else, in the changes of collective moods of the latter lately, it is possible to regress from the ascension to the conservative ascension.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, one would say, have more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis intensifies and increases.
In view of all this, talking about a current “mass rebellion” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said well, keep your eyes wide open, this is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists took inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “easily detaches from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
MARKING ON THE WALLS? –" this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented a microfiber-like hair adhesive that cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and consistent adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer, because they are soothing and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, reminds them of the risks of fruit juices, whether in cans or fresh, if associated with the intake of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he is launching a new alarm for patients, suffices for them to get rid of them.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stem and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year news bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to pay attention to what one is drinking, if one is taking medicines such as, for example, Diazepam or Méthado.
According to experts, even the orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit the drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies who will have to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and he is also a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s biggest critics of foreign policy and economic solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which has now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a very aggressive publicist, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and became less austere, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the operating system, the standard support for the OS X and the OS X.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphical development module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphic with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or workplace.
And while the theme of gratuitousness can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business that Open Office continues to challenge itself, since it can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Goal for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily L’Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to forcibly expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, scoring the best climber’s pea jersey.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times has devoted a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from origin have to support," explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani.
In most cases, the rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, no rent limit, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, have a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities feed the historic rooms.
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and undeniable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a path and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the Grand Prix of the Oscar as well
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have mostly paid the cost: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilia leads with 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono-room cinemas in the historical centers and on the outskirts.
Among the proposed regulations, there are tax incentives for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna in implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much of shared emotions, I turn to the other side to not see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are being levelled by the magistrates of the Calabrian anti-mafia Directorate, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his small lawyer son, the boss's homonym, already convicted of association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to the legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges- to officially enter the city halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusion between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest.
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the orderly interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a better known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launched.
It’s an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have looked at, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by offshore swell operating systems.
That is twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colossus in attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a truly revolutionary step.
Two years after that, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant, in the Wall Street Journal, “and it is assessing opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are traversing the path of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, apart from the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to be causing major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Green Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six marine turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of water during tides rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to extract energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Electric Energy Research, deserves at this time, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coasts, invested $7 and a half million in 2008, and foresees investments up to $35 million in 2009.
