Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal on Iran’s nuclear program, announced by Obama, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the then imminent election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police in a slightly sedentary voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was crippled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman he ever loved me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he, according to police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterward.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police hugged him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal background.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little agitated and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lambs track when he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent’s house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lambs’ longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the female charm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that borders on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial service, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to move our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentis as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Workforces for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby product retailer says it will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and 45,000 more were hired during the Christmas season in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated gnashing and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undeniably the greatest time-travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in select cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is To Be Taken Seriously
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit field, and some are starting to seriously question what it means for the chances of the real estate mogul’s nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to rising Herman Cain, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s perseverance and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has been around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthused” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “angry” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthused” vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angered” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 Independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hat, Republican voters consider Trump real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four in ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four in ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign peace two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing so.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll, they’d rather be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
On the street, a square meter of a reet roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student budde in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany’s top residences, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices at dizzying heights.
There are times several tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, well noted.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 at Olympiacos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch's boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes Treffer (89.) earns a 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the finals on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the lever pot to Munich in the third start.
In his 28th match in the Champions League to lead Bayern, Müller received good help from Olympiacos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed a shot of the world champion, thought to be flanked, to pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed vision without glittering.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the Royals, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels unbeaten with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran bravely, but often too unimaginatively in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by moving the game to the left outside of Douglas Costa, who rarely went through the previous Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in the first half.
First, when Olympiacos striker Ideae Brown hit the header of Poland off the line (26th).
Then by direct shot, the goalkeeper paired Roberto with the knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, was relying.
For example, when he steered a shot of Ideay over the lattice (56.).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-chain defender with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the frame, sat out first.
The World Cup hero only gave green light after graduation training, sports director Matthias Sammer told Sky: "Who wants to make something else out of it, that's already evil".
Guardiola also decided against him in the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the batted Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Müller put another on it.
Before the game, there were clashes in the stadium.
After a small group of partially disguised Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of the host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich supporters with sticks.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
People who smoke are at a higher risk of losing their teeth.
Smoking damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - a long-term study by Potsdam suggests this.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifespan."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from late antiquity at Cologne's Rheinufer
Archaeological finds have been made repeatedly on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archeological ground monument maintenance.
In the third section of the building of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists have now been found.
It was already known from text documents that there was a fortress at the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman is killed at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the public for help.
At around 1.40 a.m. on early Wednesday morning, the woman crossed the tracks coming from the station building towards the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she suffered the most serious injuries from it, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The reason for the young woman’s nocturnal crossing is not known to the investigating officer.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries are made by residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided via the 24-hour, free Federal Police hotline by calling 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To resolve the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP will create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically foresee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come in equal parts from the EU, the US and from third countries.
A second instance is also provided for the first time.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings had agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility to object to their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be settled there.
The Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS) required above all by large corporations is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can claim damages to taxpayers, enforce national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as inadequate.
They were criticised above all for not applying to the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta) already negotiated.
German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission took into account key points that Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibility of appeals to the economy through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felted pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost touched by Steven’s speech.
He tells from different places, which he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minutiae and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Ever since, Stevens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a reckless series: Each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and in the Rhine near has already appeared "Seven Swans" and breaks certain expectations positively.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely celebrated masterpiece was released in 2005.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises to the US Billboard charts and is not lacking in any of the year's best-selling influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Along the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is touring through Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
In theaters, he mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" that has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now banished in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folklore.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulent" and you can throw away the "plate basically".
It is only to an addition that Stevens thanks modestly, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally bows with a noisy applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's question hour is expected with excitement
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the prime minister’s question mark and meet with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-determined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being examined closely by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent during a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday, during the National Anthem, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stand in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour are also "stacked", according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is submitting amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, since he has been Tory chief, across the dispatch box in Parliament over the past decade.
The Labour chairman, who promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said the prime minister’s question hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “strike-readiness” and fighting back, and has instead undertaken to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he doesn’t participate – for example, when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater", which is often linked to the prime minister's question hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the prime minister's question hour was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shoots in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply following data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage was the quickest and most accurate estimate of the timing of an interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after taking over offer from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the luxury goods competitor Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it took in $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating for the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports apparel company reported a pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lipstick 21 years young, a hen with superb frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More like that.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is spinning through.
Viktoria Rudzinska knows.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live idol, whose posters hang up in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to sit in 10th grade in high school."
"I'll make her a dream come true."
School duty?
Who's juicing?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's made up anyway.
For advertising during the Superbowl's advertising break, he cashed in three million dollars, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle firm flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber cashes too.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're stunned at the window.
He is said to have made more than 100 million dollars in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato tinker idea
Potatoes or donuts?
It’s both possible – in the potato toner developed by Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potatoes instead of donners" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of donner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, his shop has been turning a grill skewer, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculty for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authorities, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spit contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Culinary understanding of the peoples is also good for its customers.
Metcash launches ground-level campaign to combat Aldi infestation
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi advance in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGAaide brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media shows.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 as the food, alcohol and appliances wholesaler conducts its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will grab about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA next year and 30 in WA and will achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash’s high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food and beverage sales to drop 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, top fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction while simultaneously pressuring sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by growing faster fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will increase at Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profitable growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis to be backed by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight due to Kyrgios' notorious confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a spasm thwarted a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm pretty excited about is the fact that in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn into the fight," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to a spasm in the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be served on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he also assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term fixture."
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out best. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions and keep it out of time.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, detains refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s-land and Serbian officials reacted indignantly.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
Frustrations have risen.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian Bereitschaftspolizei.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people who sought refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take another 120,000 refugees, including some from abroad.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that strongly contradicts other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, which also imposes higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said authorities managed to reach 45 people while trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed-wire train wagon arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, receives the support of 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead in women and moderates, but these lead have decreased.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently don’t support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election vote want to see him in the race – even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Just like last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics among voters of their party’s pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off in honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is in leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion on him.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the pre-election are satisfied with her statement of the matter and say it has not affected their views at all.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this matter was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general views on Clinton, although 36 percent said their views on her had deteriorated further.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views have gotten worse by Clinton.
Although Clinton is seen by her party’s voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more as honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates have now lost half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing ground.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted ahead of last month’s Fox News debate, to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with college education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been beaten down by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who fell the lowest from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in polls — he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hugs for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for holidaymakers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: The water in the North and Baltic Sea has reached a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Nearly two years after a student died during a tedious ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said Chief of Police Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's bullies; at least one student dies from the bullies every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for third-degree murder of the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
“We want to hold not only the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this – officially or unofficially – we will hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the rise will waver, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate increase may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first rise since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal highs, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market saw last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There appears to be a tendency for asset yields to be squandered 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate increases.
More precisely, the market has been mostly on the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, rather flat in the 250 days after that (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy here that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only doubled nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been focused all year on an interest rate hike by the Fed, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession heights very quickly overshadowed by the onset of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to shrink closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we are still cautious about expecting higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, and volatility has risen – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet averaged 5 percentage points higher than those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they were only imitating The Brits.
Colleague of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" into Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was “stupid” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word ‘dumb’ — but it seems to turn into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else — these are two spontaneously named examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director-general rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public outreach.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.
“And the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and commissioning new works is also really important to me,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work had to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for stepping up to the commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he would like the company to “find a hit from our in-house stable” the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering further series of The Voice in the future or to spend the fee payers money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago with the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase from the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago as buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s commuting in, and we’re likely to see the growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers withhold their purchases from this event, which takes place each last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers around their computers shrank five times to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought over bargains, could keep buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
The mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead set off on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The procession of mourning took place at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Grand Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadj will continue to go to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
King Salman said today that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said the company’s management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also denounced the group for not current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of a massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rains, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount to the permanent injured.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
As a result, 200 more screwfix stores targeting craftsmen will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can skilfully use a hammer or brush to stroke walls, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, Kingfisher’s new managing director, who owns the retail chain, said a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices is now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men outnumber the employees.
She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that feature more female single households that are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: “There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions made about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed company in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have filled exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and finance board.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-yearly profits and revenues after the group shrugged the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
Two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob had to face charges at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current trial has been postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011, funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions were used for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was ruled out by the chairman of the creative senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to condemn the infidelity, the defense stated that at no time did the association have an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials had only settled expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to about 600,000 shillings (rd. 44,000 euros).
"At the time, we were faced with the situation: shall we keep running the club or shall we lock it up?" said one of the defendants, the financial office's chief auditor in the bread trade.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
“We put money in advance, put our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said.
It was agreed with the association: they can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, the payment of the compensation was decided retroactively until 1991, with appropriate financial success.
Therefore, part of the compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits also appeared, the former obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books were managed jointly by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial settlement, only the debt-freedom was important, according to the answer.
When investigations against one official for abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account was in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know an answer to this for a long time.
Then he finally thought that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "reparation of damages".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this formulation, because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that, you're all from the tailor."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never received a cent salary, he only charged kilometers of money and diets.
On diets, he charged the club 1,000 euros per month, but the actual expenditure was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an on-site inspection, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage.
All repairs were made in cash, and he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the interview of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staffing cuts that have been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs when the company is split up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special tax burden of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs that has been going on for three years has not yet been completed.
HP had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 fiscal year.
Hewlett-Packard’s stock was down 2.3%.
The printer-grown company from Palo Alto, California is currently splitting up: This is how the computer and printer business will be bundled into a new company this year - separated from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, were the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
Revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to changes in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only late reacted to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans envisage the total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.

After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the car association VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence erupts on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water throwers at the Serbian border against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind it and a water jet was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers initially used pepper spray without interruption.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat, waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees suffocated and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. central bank
The world is watching as the U.S. central bank gathers on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who were still of the opinion last week that the Fed would do this, now think the Fed will persist a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero-area and starting a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is expected to be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday.
Death squad at Delta State University leaves apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying it was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could make it happen," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
and said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employee of the emergency call center that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "nobody will bother" but will probably be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss’s daughter was “absolutely best friends.”
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, ran away on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their fortune
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this will surely take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is revamping the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group remodel.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the group’s reorganization the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and is valuing its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The objective of the reorientation is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team led by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the re-assembly, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees of the strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots' union Cockpit (VC), negotiations are expected to resume after the court-stopped strike on Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The subject of the talks is the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come to viable results as soon as possible "in a year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background is the savings concept "Wings" in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots.
It is envisaged that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the group’s own airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this caused the left outside defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he's not going to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an eleven-meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an eleven-meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction, so it looked like it [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel really bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the prime minister decided for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All is well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content statement of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, however, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one.
As if this were not yet suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film T, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air of Mächen's name is a young thing, hopes to be a t
Although he does admit to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the money-hungry, falling trees, knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron’s constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the expulsion from England's team, but it's still difficult
To come across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you look at the squad that England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outward victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t carry any scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to drop Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since – and I’ve said this before – players are their own best picks.
A long time ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
Hopefully if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his stance, even if he didn’t perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man that I highly appreciate.
He’s an X-factor cricketer that we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us very hard.
He needs to get at least the same chances as the ones before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil’s-eye of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he’s a number 3 for her, and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs right away and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a dot, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England have made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was said earlier.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team leaders don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> exit of the UK from the EU) could gain traction if the economy goes into a flute by 2017
David Cameron’s inexhaustible renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper and deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn as leader of Labour or the TUC, which is violently falling apart over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat’s friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always at fault, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like them even if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for an outside-looking UK inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exaggerated long-term perseverers like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine that they’ll tear out a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can faintly remember Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing crooks, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him, rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron’s referendum whirlwind, for Blair had set the principle of the EU’s unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back on Monday in Westminster — I told him he no longer needed to waste time on me — seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly say it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional bleaching trend and the wilder fields of Tory’s little Englishmanship can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contestants and MPs after all the reports at their no-deal on Monday night.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the swirl of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Labour’s support in the referendum campaign to be self-evident, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of strife.
As with his ambiguities about NATO – Tom Watson is rock-solidly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to exit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a 12-person meeting, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “Basic Report” last month and describes it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A lead article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy foundation” on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims “are based on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy."
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis review; the results of the meeting were put together.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was previously said to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he is said to have received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group’s research “states significantly” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products under most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims have been responded to before.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried unsuccessfully to contact the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissions or broadcasts programs that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals,” Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I do not consider a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They are sending The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s of course nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax fund programs that could even be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what this public-law television should be like.
I don’t think this would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more public-law niche programs should “go to BBC4 where you pretty much can’t measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue if they go on their seemingly sacred missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in broadcasting fees.”
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Speaking about the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who get a lot of money for <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education — he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio — and it should take an example at the public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to “inform, enlighten and entertain.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that are too high for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did if they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
“We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons trade fair video.
Horrible killer drones!
Knee Crushing Leg Cuffs!
Scattered bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to bring to the fore the British government's readiness to bring weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Centre in London's Jamboree in the Ex.
DSEI Weapons Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Flow to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you travel with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade show.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of envelope keys claimed to “acquire access to about one-third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet.”
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political works to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, noting that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the arms fair – through a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic ambiguous corporate advertising, but "by infusing with bright colors and animation it remains more sticky."
“They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors scavenge fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a U.S. military order about "the AT4CS RS shot from the shoulder."
This includes a “uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target.”
Whatever it does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student dorm, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I angered – and the numerous, long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The influx into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmites, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these were fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress up and tweak their underwear.
Related: Don't Think About Starting a Relationship at University
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room buzzing culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I get back the energy that I spent interacting with you.”
Try to sense when a classmate is exhausted from sociability – and send him a text instead of tapping.
Speaking of tapping, do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes by baking.
Since you start university at the height of the back-mania, knocking on people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less odd than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to entertain and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to put themselves to sleep when they knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the word, one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind putting drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They reacted to it with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she had her own music clattered, locked her door, and proceeded to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing to think of a roommate as your future spouse, get close to her, get divorced, and then have to see her every day and maybe experience how she moves all her mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your lower body some sense.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unenclosed room, the boundary between an ulka and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is fun, but it only takes a few moments before it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and entertaining lesson about security by hiding – but never spoil anyone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not tack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Detached houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds row houses in the central Franconian Eckental for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single parent and the low earner."
“I’m showing how you can still build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: he builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
In the face of the refugee flow, we will also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, excluding land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have carried out my project correctly.
Particularly complicated it always makes the menacing Damocles sword special construction and the pitch regulation.
Horrible.
It is still assumed that who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is a lack of space.
Refugees and asylum seekers don’t have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don’t you intensify the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true: We have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly be afforded any more.
My project has the message that even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low-income person.
I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Releases
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it’s ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message that says that the "software update failed".
To circumvent the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm recedes or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by slimming down the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone may switch off midway and this could cause the update to break.

You should also make sure that you have checked our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight for the world title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one motto: "full attack".
The World Cup 2nd emphasized before the start in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and doubles champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve season races and is also taking the floodlight grand prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence Singapore’s Grand Prix remains unclear.
For days, a bell has hung over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is a holder of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accommodate chess players who are unable to apply for membership.
Youth work and the search for talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistif have joined forces under the guise of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More precisely, at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new branch office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and those seeking advice will now receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or benefits from health and nursing funds.
For years, we have observed with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not uncommon that many benefits are not taken advantage of by the cash registers, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the antonist hospital and the civil hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers from the Seniors Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Center," said Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seen by both managing directors in particular in the demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to the isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
The Social Foundation has thus made a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 2pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm to 6pm and Saturday from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set, the 6th of October has now been set as the date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third-tier FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy to know when the game is going on stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the now-started card pre-sale.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 with victories against 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-league runner-up SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener architect Karl Mang passed away at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the deans of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the artist's house said on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese accuses policeman of money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been badly noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim is engaged, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have increased 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, he has not done so.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard outside displaying a penal note for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the penalty at her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," the city of Bremen said.
Only after that will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.

For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been ripping out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghan man
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft fuel station.
Three people were also staying on the site of the gas station.
One of these men yelled at the young man and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose bone and bled heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and sneered at the batter, the batter at first gave up on his victim.
The injured young man was taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove demonstratively past there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the batter and another male person.
Using a baton, they beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, there is only one vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller acquires Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors are absent - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be with his successor in the next few months with half a job.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and also wants to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was over, I just called her."
The couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so it was agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, Frank Müller, a double family father, also grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover were followed by stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the chief emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering in the DRC-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a GP, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Mullers, both internists, want to settle down as GPs.
“The endoscopy is therefore coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
The Mullers will receive a total grant of 50,000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," says Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another GP practice.
A positive side effect of the acquisition by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who attend Müller’s speaking class continue to look especially into familiar faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers grinning.
A little bitterness she feels after the long time already.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients again and again," says the internist.
Her husband laughingly adds, "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."
"So far I've always pushed myself for gardening, now it could be different".
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do so “of course”.
The safety and security of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that “there is a need for clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
We need a controlled approach.
Croatia Considers 'Corridor' - Slovenia Refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to allow incoming refugees to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany, and possibly also to build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not seen by Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock its borders for refugees.
“Each EU member has to fulfill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” Györkös Znidar stressed.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter Eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the evening hours of Tuesday to evade registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in the Croatian town of Tovarnik ever since.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, disputes that it is instructing people to take certain routes: "We can neither do nor want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, at least in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
“We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police told us to come here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the previously predicted shift of the Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, "has comprehensive possibilities for border control."
Strict checks are carried out in order to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and EU partners have consistently provided the country with good evidence of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down at a local gazebo in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers Advise Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already begun distributing maps of alternative routes through Croatia to the refugees.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area, there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, minefields that have not been cleared.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Suprananok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insights into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is said to have been used to conduct insider transactions in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars were raised.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
Trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice assistance Mannheim has been in operation for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People do their cares, partly quick steps, partly cozy bumbling.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at the Paradeplatz.
Stop the city trains.
Pulsating, pulsating life in splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle four large panels each with the title "Before I die I want".
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid has brought this action to the attention of its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff.
While some spontaneously grab a passerby to the chalk and add the phrase "confirm my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the United States", "stop the war" or "suffer not long", others stay short, read, say phrases like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
On the margins, small discussions develop about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only when I realize that the end is coming for me in this world at some point can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Mannheim Diaconate, which together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still associated with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although it is precisely the hospice movement in recent years that has contributed much to the opening up of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through her personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to become involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was looking for volunteers, she immediately reported and was there at the time of its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospice St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences she has had.
“I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of health funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the deceased and mourners' companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx Results Mixed, Financial Prospects Reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a survey from FactSet to be $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will become effective on January 4th, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company “is generating solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transport sales rose by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening them at one end of the decorated, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most of the economic data shows that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to amplify this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is justification enough to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is insecure for the financial market.
About half of the economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed would trade.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world slumped at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would thwart global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would be taking the toll at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better under control.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “close” its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc.’s global asset management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements seemingly unrelated to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited discernible impacts on growth in the United States,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The latest turbulences are not coming close to this plane, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets get excited,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central contact point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and utensils, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there’s a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is located near the cash registers and has different take-away options.
What's here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and file the fish and even fry it for you if desired.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pigs' natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small Living Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still loves teaching.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality council of Bernried approved the construction of the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar systems.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, on an application for a construction "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "sattle roof with non-mitigating first and roof top" should be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large southern roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof slope, which for energetic reasons - unlike the construction plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced.
An "exemption" was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow "exemptions" with regard to the roof slope - with the Bernrieder Gemeinderat usually proceeding rather restrictively with exemption applications.
However, the construction of gyms is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this", says Steigenberger.
The construction of the gym at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the Landrat Office for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is expected to close sooner than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of its employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is foreseen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by Landratin Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place next Wednesday, September 23.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority will move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot come to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees should be informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who will take over, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who declared himself ready to take the lead from October 1 and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "revaluation" and an expansion of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
Transitional for the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until then next year the former hospital of Knappheit, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, faced rumours that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which had been "positively and very understandingly" received by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years, did not exist.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to assume the position of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are required tonight (20.15 pm) at the Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for pride.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
Several hunters were on duty during the aberning on a cornfield near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
16-Year-Old Missing from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence Crimes
A suspect has led police to the corpse of the 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, prosecutors and police said on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday night, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across the victim’s personal items.
During interrogations in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion against the 20-year-old finally emerged.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted to police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be brought before the judge on Wednesday, with investigators charging him with murder.
Further information on the circumstances of the incident is intended to lead to further investigations.
Refugees need housing: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overcrowded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
To this result comes a study commissioned by the Association "Social Housing".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first-aid accommodation.
Many then run into the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also highlights significant shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing for a housing deficit that is growing year on year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
As a result, many working people lived in emergency rooms in large cities.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute on the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are intended to relaunch social housing.
For example, land-use tax could be waived and the land-use tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a period of time.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The support program for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been withdrawn on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Refugees have freedom of movement: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is practically no way through Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to allow the passage through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
The route is dangerous, though.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the isolation of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV channel RTL.
The day before, Hungary had closed its border to refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can pass through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police had arrested the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU's neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to get to Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police arrested 366 people.
Just before the gate closed on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicts face imprisonment of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established "transit zones" at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - most importantly the Röszke crossing.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary's view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Barricades were demolished and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, few refugees still reach Austria.
The country has also tightened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drives "beached" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to near Passau.
Previously, we had the unexpected guests first tasting, with jause and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
“This was a matter of course for us,” Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased,” said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany had been stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday socially, the day before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending more zig-thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to build structures at the Röszke camp that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government’s attitude into the void of National Socialism.
It is not only the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas who are suffering from this policy.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “promised land” they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has everything to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up neighborhoods for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also carried out without great turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organizational "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a requirement of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 homes will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the chiefs of state.
These would have assured him that he would also create neighbourhoods for the incoming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also sets high expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be necessary for quarter givers to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or size of the headlights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
That, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful at accommodation, Konrad explains with his experience.
I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in his face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to increase to three to four.
My own neighborhood search has not been successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the affected people can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further sites should be checked for their suitability.
The head of the city is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked away"
In a lengthy phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked.
It is still possible for refugees to travel to the Federal Republic of Germany.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the applicants for protection would be brought to Germany on regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is a "logical consequence" for Pühringer of the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neuen Werft" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2,700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some of them.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises some: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 million was invested by S&T in the site, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.3 million from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the remaining 2700 square meters in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are the focus.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously it was rebuilt several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time whether I should open another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the greater Linz area selling this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has gotten wide from her mother into the cradle.
I am most suited when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why is it that some women find themselves in delight at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman can not answer with last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for thrillers.
Whether he is expressing xenophobic views, addressing journalists in a frenzy, or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis politics – the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is vigorously instigating the election campaign.
And cuts well in this.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate town of Kall, where the real estate billionaire’s grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant town is over-twenty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find it kind of exciting, but they’re not so impressed in their Kaltstadter way either,” says Simone Wendel.
The native caller has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous splashes, among which, in addition to Trump, the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to the fore in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “already a bit of a big mouth,” says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname "The Brulljesmacher" - in high German: the Angeber, she says - is the nickname that the town has in its vicinity.
Trump is coming from the village of the beggars.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digging facility in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group were the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not record Trump because he once ran away without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the progeny.
He had repeatedly spoken abusively about Mexican immigrants to the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“The way he polteres, that’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“Grandma was a born Trump, grandfather was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American more distant, "he's always so rousing".
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He's never taken care of Kallstadt".
Pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She would be better off if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winemaker’s daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has been watched by 12,000 moviegoers, even in the United States the interest is arousing.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 “mountain climbing villages” in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not caused major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international TV shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This drawback of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today’s 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330,000 from Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, resulted in an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a million-dollar-minute replacement that failed to overwhelm the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Revealing a secret?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unaware of who is winning The Bachelor.
The woman who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was shrouded in the utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before out of three to be two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women lyrically discussed why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, “If not you, who should get Wood’s last rose?”, their answers could become the game destroyer, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had an easy relationship from day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah’s) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzling.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - there is a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US – and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had banished Hayne to the bench for the remainder of the game when he lost a run as did the Aussie rugby league convert on his first point return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49er’s sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his sloppy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne kicks at a point recovered from the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
“That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller coaster with gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters are calling for the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavarian schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraktion der Freien Wähler will meet in the Unterfränkische Kommune until Friday.
In fact, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will override the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as they were during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.
“This is not how it goes, we have to address the causes,” the Free Voter Chief said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to expel free voters as soon as possible.
That’s why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform federal standards of the federal states."
"Bayern is deferring, others are not."
“We need to be more able to act.”
But the country policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term focus remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot trial "Middle-level plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school middle-level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it then takes another nine years to graduate.
However, Aiwanger does not go far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 People Killed After Police Shoot Rubber Shots at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber floors.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used, which are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could go into effect on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Center Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
The site is planned to be used for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for the appropriate offers, it is said on the part of the city.
The investor in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Many residents continue to be concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months, it had been negotiated, mined, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now plans are on the table for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Initially, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on the offensive from the system-building management: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, which is worth around 10 to 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among seafarers who had come to the meeting highlighted the images and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, butler owner and board member at the stakeholder’s interest group, Pro Hieve, complains: “This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings.”
In addition, he fears, like many other critics of the project, that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come whole bus loads, so that this is what counts," Schulz said.
However, what is happening on the area of one hectare of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we have to have a conclusive concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because this is still missing, the building plans are still variable.
Twins of Gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with its young gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as mother Dian keeps them close to her body so far.
At first, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, about in the middle between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show anything,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained about the same for those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had a complete and 28% had a partial resolution of their diabetes.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes completely resolved in only one percent and in part in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the blood pressure, triglyceride, and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had more weight loss compared to the gas tractomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and had a more complete overcoming of diabetes (16.7 vs. 46.9).
While the new study does not show any survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have tied their bodies firmly to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story takes place in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently gaining increasing attention in Belletristik: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly during school hours, after years meets the swarm of her youth again, and this one falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder’s recently published novel “Actually, we are not that way.”
Beyond the love story, the novel may be of particular interest to Hunsrück readers, as it plays in Langeweiler and the surrounding towns.
The main professional author grew up in Langeweiler and is glad that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not adequate.
“It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attack and found that the US’s violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand sanitizer by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who ingest heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intakes in children under the age of 12, reported by poison control centers, rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going into the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxic Emergency Call Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whisky go around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if children come up with it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah muttered her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand sanitizers outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York state planned to poison their “common” teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the failed plan as "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision on the cross-section between the Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two leading vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he bumped into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.

Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was rejected spontaneously by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
“I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way – but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was pointing to some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox cadre’s unity.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea forward Michu, with Celtic in talks during the transfer period, has indicated that he may withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.

Hearts on SFA battle suspended because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - the third red card from Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson continues what he said, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management

I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to win "unhappy" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight the Hamilton Accies desperately to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven-meter lead in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have never won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK’s of 5.5 percent, as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland’s Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupt the process
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test found 0.89 promille in a 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man die.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator’s gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it unemotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story the way he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks the movement’s publicity work against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don’t want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I think there's a strong likelihood he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can’t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "sweetly persuade him to return to the shore."
Police in Canning Vale were called to a house-breaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trenches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousin biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Stewards Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to End Racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-tupfer test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had restrained himself for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that it all comes out all at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised heads, and I want my owners to think that I’m trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I’m doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should certainly grab their noses because they failed to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, acting president of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still doing so today.
Does that make me think it’s going to be personal?
Does the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and discard me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been that way all day yesterday, which it was.
It was like that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all understand that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be indicted for driver escapism and omission of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims of ring fights
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized his players' tackle as an "agenda setting" by two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tactic, saying they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team reassured him as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“It keeps coming back — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the past six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has brought the turnaround for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this happens over and over again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he’d take a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more trust because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored higher than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and not points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the pre-finals at AAMI Park on Saturday night.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may be facing a life sentence for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the cafe might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to secure his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden,” Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the condition that he hand out his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police every day and holds himself to an exit block from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tore apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a collision with three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's house of the accident cause completely disintegrated.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to two o’clock.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone as she slept, logging into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered “relevant” web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would "lead to pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretend to be a policeman to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty under the indictment to taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violating the warrants on January 25 of this year, and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be listed on the Register of Sexual Offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders even before the date of the verdict.
Locksmiths avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many locksmiths left more people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
More than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
At Munich’s main train station, according to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived again compared to the start of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the re-introduction of checks at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" in the southwest is expected
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong low is the runner of the storm "Henry", which in recent days has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, bends of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Bodenseekreis until early Thursday.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again for a longer time.
Every two years, the automakers show their innovations at the IAA.
2015 is especially moving with the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the German Federal Motor Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations fell on this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-end and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with dealers in the fall.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It is part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking forward to an entry below its biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
Hesse also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the van, which is already on display at the IAA.
And what will happen to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and an emphasised sporty GT version.
It will be available in the beginning of next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, Nissan wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The base model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe starts in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën trim mainly applied their hands to the front: here the grille was redesigned and the altered headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are being added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human dignity
The Federal Constitutional Court has rightly granted an ex-prisoner of the Tegel prison, who was housed for months in a cell too small.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, detainees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small a cell.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can hope for money even if they were confined in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
An ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed at the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer, is now back on the loose, was transferred to a larger cell.
His civil liability lawsuit against the state of Berlin failed, however, due to the unworthy conditions of detention.
However, the Constitutional Judges upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's dignity violated.
The Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were relevant for the compensation for the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "a precariousness of the legal protection of the personality to be feared".
The court must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of detainees.
It was not until April that they awarded a prisoner compensation for being locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had confirmed an inmate in a parallel case in November 2009 an unworthy accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed for three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even if it is said to have come to clashes due to the tense situation.
According to the Judicial Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young people, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is happening to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year, according to German Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we can do it".
The following overview gives an overview of what is happening in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as what has been built so far (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially for affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price commitment annually, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable housing units.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, it is assumed that in the long term 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them enter, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residency requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
The majority of the society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - has adopted the view that refugees should be given quicker access to the labour market.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that workplaces are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt’s view, the royal road to labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rootless parents, it is very important to keep the family together first," says Ilja Koschembar, a spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the kita, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Students who are willing to study could have easier access to higher education.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Benefit Act when they begin their studies.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a baf<0xC3><0xB8>g, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to baf<0xC3><0xB8>g.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be Bafög-entitled, from 1 January 2016 this range is reduced to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should receive Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which professionally takes care of the newcomers.
Rights also include responsibilities.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the readiness to take a hearty stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “immediately realized their right to stay here, in Germany,” he told the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a matter for the whole society than it is today.
In order to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism becomes more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long called for and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany commit to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as man power and capacity is concerned, we can do that,” he told the daily Mirror.
However, additional money will have to flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Services rendered could be billed to the federal states later.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided for by the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors are mainly creating the language barriers.
So far, according to Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are better informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be borne, she demands.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people, it is HIV education.
With the partly other images of the disease, German doctors came from their education, but clearly, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the lack of doctors, perhaps even relief is in sight through the refugees.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are estimated to be mentally ill by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by the TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart attacks and fears of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dread and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, staff members or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculation, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the fascination of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, a pet teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manegen production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people out of their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old.
"Manege cocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", as Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus’ program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with fun and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is to conquer women’s hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertip feeling and articulation.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are only too often a topic at various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the position: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each litter unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are affectionately called, is read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it also does not want to go to the manege.
So the supreme commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened.
"But then, all of a sudden, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst: “Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11:00 and 16:00.
Thursday is Family Day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe’s address with bullying.
Last month, they had exploited him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them against disturbing Mr Mugabe’s address.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned Members of Parliament that the immunity in Parliament will end, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and service businesses.
The expected job cut will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is to lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage is called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that tightly focused companies are performing better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then found himself back to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had suffered before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days in six of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal start their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are allowed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give players who need a little break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons of last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is huge,” Wenger said.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy moods,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first in order for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of telephone soul care explained to me: “My listening role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when one speaks openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move past Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who set the French champion on the road, but then missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they aim not only to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances at the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even though there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven’t scored one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which could keep a 2:2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was knocked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why when he stepped into Marco Verratti's Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing by Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with a few flaws and poor finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts alone patted in the first half and then gave up after Cavani had deployed him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a shootout, which was diverted by Wiland in the 52nd minute to the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was knocked out of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Stay away from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of more comprehensive plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over long-term slowed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw material prices by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people arrive in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will respond to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosting Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner tonight after the two heads of state held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before heading to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car leased and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and once rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp and drive.
A 29-year-old man from Gotha County did the same.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, crashed into the sledgehammer on a wet road and drove into the dashboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to the property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World champions, two times European champions, one time World champions – Xavi’s title list is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the 2008 European Championship before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing,” he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change was not made.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a has signed Guardiola and I have played a great European Championship."
“Pep told me that I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
“That’s how he got me.”
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, switched the reds off (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying it is not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO’s Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when you’re casting the film, not when you’re casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted with shock, insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the Martian actor's comments solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about — whoever’s going to be the director — how they’re going to treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a whore who is beaten by her white doll.
The producer of Dear White People stood up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directorship "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing, “Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity – that’s SO WHITE it hurts.”
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took effect nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to order discriminatory practices against colored detention.
In February, the singer made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the arduous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still shocked by the grand prize win of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never made more than $10,000 or had a lifetime,” Isaac E. said of his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britons, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don’t think he has any grudges about it.
He's just as happy to have done what he's done.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers slither past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Formerly they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to rise within a game-half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to finish this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to go into the game very focused.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's swinging the wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (strike training), he looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the rear at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the innings with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks achieved a bout, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who escaped right-handed Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a couple of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall managed an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon and achieved a 5-4 stand.
The right-hander, however, knocked out Sano in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still immobile Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
“Obviously not the start I wished for,” said Hughes, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff bat in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who managed a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to reach third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Remarks: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder fracture, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a rupture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people arriving in it will then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was estimated that there were between 450 and 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government presidium responsible for the initial reception, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Due to the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German involvement in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options of action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective foresight".
Four years ago we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is falling on our doorstep," he told German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary even now.
Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had arrived from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, have called for a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd), EU Interior Ministers want to make a new call for the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee demand in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour consultations with the prime minister in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who needed protection would get it too.
But those who do not have a prospect of staying can not stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now has to cope with a "huge force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are stranded on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent trawlers from seeking escape routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government condemned the plan immediately.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
Thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border in Turkey, according to eyewitness reports.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of Saturn’s moon Enceladus is a global ocean.
Researchers from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini" conclude this.
Thus, the moon swings slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
While the motion is small, it is still too large for a permanently solid celestial body, according to a Cornell University statement in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama is missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to give up Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "predictably four weeks of forced break".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a great loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non-aggressive professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is expected to start running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a head-on collision.
However, despite his initial fears, he was left without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often more likely to be discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Most importantly, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 helpers for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are sought.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its holiday season workforce by 95,000 helpers.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First hair dryer storm, then distinctive cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm force through the hair dryer valleys.
After fouling on Thursday morning, we cross a marked cold front, which brings heavy rains, winds and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a powerful southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys at night on Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the föhn valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can occasionally penetrate into the adjoining central land, and on the mountains, even hurricane waves of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to accumulate on the alpine south slope.
It is raining here, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the south of the Alps, over the next 48 hours, partly more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected, after heavy rains have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer goes out of the air, as a cold front rolls over Switzerland with heavy, partly rainy rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly until stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days in the north present autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was christened in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the Working Group of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority only in secret for centuries.
With the square becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11 for some months.
He considered the city at that time to be a wasteland of sin.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then, with his theses against the abdication trade, initiated the division of the Western Church.
Hammer Artist Invested Three Years in Personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of Books".
Cycles have been created that dedicate themselves to themes such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father’s Prayer.
With this he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible sites on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry envelope has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice as much a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Order of the Lords.
"Then the education happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I've been trying to work that up, maybe to tolerate myself again with the Lord Father."
His second goal is to make art more important again in a fast-paced time: "Today, the perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be "introduced" into the images, to be able to act on them, to discover and feel what power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious ones.
"It was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Mühler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction start for BMX train is approaching
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, hills were modeled for a circular course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn, it was finished again.
Failures in politics and administration caused dissatisfaction, especially among the locals who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills removed, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councilwoman Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to announce in the Committee on Children and Youth.
“I hope there’s still something visible happening this year,” she said.
The work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a "further commemorative break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is a clear sign this weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and assures the politicians of its help in tackling the upcoming problems.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge for our country since reunification."
“Nobody can say in principle, it’s none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet with Minister of State Ms <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor."
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he said.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive path must be taken by politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"With the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will wear on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can look away."
“We can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Qualifying match against Hungary on Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
It is great that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places.
It is equally great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
This year and next year, the association, together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already withdrawn the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he had carried in his left hand, the "economic week" reported on Wednesday.
“He almost bled, was powerless, then dragged himself out onto the street – that’s what he told us last week,” said Hasso Plattner, co-founder of WiWo.
McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "It can happen to anyone."
“It’s important to get back up when you fall.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell from the wheel.
At the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is therefore as little as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally vanished.
The national player will also be absent from the table leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"Unfortunately we cannot resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Due to the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his pedigree on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European league games in the future, Tuchel, however, left open.
It is very likely that he will also play the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl as comprehensible: "This makes Marco not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robot Cars: Government Wants Leading Role for Germany
According to the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IAA Motor Show of a "new era of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital listening radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver is "not burdened with additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The federal government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "only to be expected far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to be around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said Sören Bartol, a SPD transport politician.
However, the issue of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, concludes that only 8% of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32% expect only in 20 years, 31% do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent.
Nevertheless, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, this could be imagined at least 15 percent in flowing traffic, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Nearly one in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current situation, the Düsseldorfer wants to hit the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only individually.
The final decision is due to be taken by September 22 at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time for a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
“Without Timo, the downside is that we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said European singles champion Dimitrij Ovcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at the time, and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by this," said the world ranking fifth.
English national footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis in the 20-year-old teammate of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a leg fracture.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition in Munich on Wednesday about his work.
The highlights: showcase dolls that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became, among other things, the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say anymore today that I’m the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on display from September 18 in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, "To me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal, Canada, and Paris Station.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful dresses,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely-to-understand work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was made: For example, a stylist was specifically engaged in haircutting the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have taken 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, sleek, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show, he was unable to pay for the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener Spitze as a fashion niche
In the past, it was about the long embroidery machines and around plaudits to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers, who for example further processed them into ceilings and curtains.
This alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style eras, forms an increasing potential for ordering.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken down.
Private specialist shops and also wholesale there is almost no more.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way yet.
Today, the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian space and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidered pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been holding a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg campus of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts in Zwickau and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to compete against the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think primarily economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new “Mary Poppins” movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, this is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who will play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader for the world
The economy needs to open up broader to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Encouraging new start-ups and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOE), raising private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
Following the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, additional areas will be opened for private investment.
“The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to perform their duties and to employ professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement issued after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in robbery fishery
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of wrong industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full weight to pregnant women and toddlers," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the nerve agent limits for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that, based on the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary manoeuvre that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt said.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched across the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal combustion.
German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Greens-Bundestag MP Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
