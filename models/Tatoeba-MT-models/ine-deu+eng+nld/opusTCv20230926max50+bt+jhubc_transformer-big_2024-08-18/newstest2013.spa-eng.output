A Republican strategy to impede Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hampered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, such laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the ballot and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana’s law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day of the poll in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 led to a drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law that required the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Doing or Not Doing the Test?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, question whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of contagion between the sample groups was detected, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, in which case he should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms the health of people.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers are at increased risk.
"Research shows that regular practice of lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
The charcuterie products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each with his doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a major shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume that this is about Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem small. We'll see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up getting hurt.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories website The Particle Adventure, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, one might point out here, are not the exotic beasts we might believe.
In fact, if he manages to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, of infrared, of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
The most stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
It takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the big hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don’t: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick on its own to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all these investigations “contribute” to? asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many want to find each other fervently, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impact of such research on our day-to-day lives is difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say it won’t have any.
Let’s face it: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories had no idea at all what a revolution their work would bring.
They understood the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle said, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this pickup now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
“I had been given five years of life, but I have already had seven,” he says, passing by, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Courageous, he even smiles, speaks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is for my diarrhea to be cured, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man stands,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer “curative” care.
Mrs. A.'s greatest fear, 89, is to die "consciously and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires in this life,” she says, before agreeing to wear a mask to help her breathe.
And in the coming days, he expects a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we all know that we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer in control of their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the centre of Victor-Gadbois, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the backyard, well placed between his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
“Since six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal palliative home care society, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative lack in Quebec’s health care that causes many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminents such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she says, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in emergencies in great pain without being done what is necessary to relieve her.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s survival hopes were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who claim death thank their caregivers for failing to meet their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want them to relieve me.”
This report has been made possible thanks to a journalism grant from Canada’s health research institutes.
Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An "industry" that went too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system gets pulverized once we’ve hunted the mainstream media,” says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former Montreal police chief.
He spearheaded the 2011 scandal, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement of road contracts in Quebec, which then-liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” containing some of his instincts to stick with a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, as it hopes to be able to "demonstrate the existing ploys behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the “Marteau Squad” police, who, since 2009, have made Montreal’s “Sewerage Cartel” moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to file serial charges of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
It has formally accused Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the left during the 2000s, distributing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organising an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% in terms of fake extras.
In addition, a party organizer for the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers of dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in a full real estate boom.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money.
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant not to repeat the dubious practices.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is unsettled above all by the role of "elected politicians in the current strategism".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100 to parties, but that won’t change the donation, he said, “as long as election spending isn’t strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It calls for a complete overhaul of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We can't fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would I explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day by day advance by his side.
The technical staff has also helped me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't heat up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preform center to my passing through Saint-Etienne, I’ve always progressed in leaps and bounds.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our leading position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to be able to receive the round of eight finals.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champions.
In the last season, we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It’s normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built on time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the eighth final, and they have invested a lot too!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be to neglect our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a "Golden Dependency."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he’s proven in every team he’s gone through that he’s a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurovision.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and it is because we have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps’ first month at the front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the team to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is the opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning to around ten dollars today (the quotes are listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not at all impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competitive with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance a video game and that can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is broadcast throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "crossing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would accept only one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computational power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
“The bug used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Heavyweight actors such as Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
“They exchanged $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite a bit in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in stores, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of reviewing hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We have left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
Those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish pamphlets presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, by abolishing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the land and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country heavily dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls ' schools, children ' s schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO agricultural rehabilitative works of collective interest.
Those jobs, eager to get local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection, and increased cropland.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial turmoil.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delusions” and continues “betraying his word” and “trapping the right.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to put an end to the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the polemic wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or keep my powers fully", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
The majority of liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not make their views stand.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As you might expect, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all views, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
“We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Neither will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy continues and from now on insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go out on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the networks full.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Painful Way").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, the Stone of the anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are found in the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are engaged in climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Herm<0xC3><0xB3>n, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
From there, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In one trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Rolls of Qumran, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathing museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health (disambiguation)
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with salt water, brine and curative mud and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed the famous maritime route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shequels (currently 1-3$.8 shequels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower Town with the Upper Town.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel by any type of public transport costs 6 shequels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning, a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, flakeless fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, the falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" impressively.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The snorkelers love the crowded places and do not reject the treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds the same index of 51% in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are debating the consequences of the mandatory examination law, fraudsters who trade with "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
On December 1, a law came into force that required every immigrant to take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and that of the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law shall not apply to persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, Fatality and Defense of Rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to submit to the tests in all cities, right now in Russia are open more than 160 centers of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are those immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, take a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow coven, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are cheated, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirmed the head of the labor immigration department of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, let alone dress them, shoe them and buy them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights advocates point out an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
“They ask us a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be rude, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been able to pass the exam for the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal trade in arms
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeeze shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeeze seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "meaningless rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, told the BBC news service of Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 offences involving the use of firearms were committed in internal organs, compared to a total of 1,168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Higher Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "army or military investigation", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets said.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were deliberately set off to cover the foul,” a former military official said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“Now they have proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute under-the-rope weapons to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The gun shop owner, who asked not to mention his last name, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some apheresis, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"He brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when it is necessary to comply with the crime discovery plan, they make trial purchases to the illegal arms dealers," he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy suggested I go to the Begovaya platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "skinite" where we could negotiate.
About the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store employee. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get there, say, "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell you that a tooth had fallen off on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I am not going to tell him.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for rabbit: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad “Buying a gun or a machine gun.”
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n" (conserved spelling).
"I buy TT gun. Moscow", laconically puts your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions to know where the gun is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, the NGO’s press secretary for the right to arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you are left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, constituting 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as ATMs at McDonald’s
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in the United States against low wages being paid in Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and bounce back in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the rise in modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of the protest organizers is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes coomenza.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many underpaid Walmart workers buy only on the job.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" protest participants demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted in their stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that Walmart’s “less than five” employees had left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR stunt” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and so for now there is none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it’s possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teens went through McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food chefs and cashiers start paying at least $15 an hour, meaning they should double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law forbids the administration to impede this right and punish union activists with cunning and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democrat politicians, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers to be able to receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
“For now, fooling the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was reported that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been caught up in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional display systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device’s camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made an adjustable 1 to 100 ms processing delay contact sensor and it should be mentioned that modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible fingerboard.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh intrusion into the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibleness to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive for researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens the inhabitants with smiles and elevates everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organillo and became the organillo of St. Petersburg, since he has matured to make such a difficult role, due to his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of no good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was already over.
I joined the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were supposed to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Van Gogh Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That’s where our employees and regular customers went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the actuality and occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum on Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything gets wet and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting oneself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person should not even be given a hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed when you change clothes.
We just saw you in the role of urban organist, a cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simplists wanted another.
Now they’ve all been divided into microcommunities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 people will never come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money only to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be devoted to culture.
When kings were right everything was different, kings perhaps did not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and make their way.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is terrain.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are lots of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in pregnancy.
As a result, we get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they did not find support, the chicks turned randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the unfortunate thing was that after four days they were just dying.
“And twice we managed to get the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,” comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In the beginning, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be conducted,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying seagull, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says a veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flying into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new paths in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The cosmonaut preparation center's hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its birth element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to then water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity is necessary.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitize very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit to wear a special training suit, such as for adults.
You will simply be deprived of what is vital to you.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally unsuitable person,” Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee at the Institute of Biomedical Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will be a reality, when humans on their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: The inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" has not given with the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is slow.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), said in an interview with Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xBD>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its implementation must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are missing," he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDGs (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors, so is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the monitoring committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
To put it simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement is to be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and, subsequently, the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely such common control that could help us to stop investing in lawmaking, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economy means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the award means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paperwork,” those who want to look for system failures will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it a similar office to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Accounts.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not normally like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it cannot be clarified exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model have to face a large number of problems.
If it weren't for that, you wouldn't have any benefit from collaborating with our office, don't you think?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office, and does it have any bearing on its impact?
Given the relatively short period of validity of this amendment, it has not yet manifested itself in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is seen in the process of preparing future checks: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and the like.
Do you consider that the passage of this law is beneficial or rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no bearing on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We’ll see where this started path takes us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0x9B>varc system, referring to the fact that they are autonomous only on paper.
Is the svarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can impede the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but you can't say we're going to act like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we are missing.
The roads have ice sheets, although most of them are traversable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice and snow plates.
Temperatures will drop and range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
Instead, on the ridges of the Metalic Mountains snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and first-class road in the region are now accessible without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and blizzarded snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Directorate of Roads and Highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains to the Orlické Mountains.
There is a layer of snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although caution should be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will fluctuate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads may also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region’s road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, sections with ice plates are also warned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less traveled roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc (region)
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are snow remains.
The drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will meet with half-waste snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," confirmed today an operator of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration to the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenick<0xC3><0xA1> and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads can be crossed without restrictions, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk<0xC3><0xA1> road the drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Operators of roads in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway. On the other hand, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported for the time being.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected to rain and snow that will melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news stories that we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar stated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear it at the benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav school regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers, and we do our best to make this possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
There are several groups and performers in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalistic, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as hard as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
<0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is not to my surprise.
Even in Moscow, from where we have recently returned, everything came out without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not common for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, for example, is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been established that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go through behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want to go.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will start to really change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a great deal of willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a little of our hands (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you plan to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else could be done.
The world of the show is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just an advance for them, but for the whole of society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe it, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, it can’t be avoided.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will be attended by 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conferencing to sing together the group’s song The Tap Tap “End of the World, Cancelled”
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entrance in the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a dresina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the design of the project is also not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresina or for its braking.
The information about this dressing is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes evident that the research reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year was published the study "Rakete - air torpedo and air bomb", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, four very extensive articles on astronautics refer to society for the first time.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it was proposed to create a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) rocket probe, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the construction of the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was going to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Intercosmos program, Poland joined the space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) causes economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "provokes a decrease" of the price of the competitor in order to gain the majority of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most employers, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper there, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This situation promotes the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own populations without taking into account social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in current laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already at a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed at such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The austerity measures of almost all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live with a miserable wage on the edge of society, in the hope that one day private capital will reach the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the satiety that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political march and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.
These types of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power emanates not from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation find themselves quickly in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his book The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for a long time and the administrations were forcibly engaged."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimate favors and help to fund stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any hindrance and people went to the polls with the vote clapped in advance"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It was necessary to change the situation so badly that it was necessary to talk about it in a serious way.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that the present society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and reclaiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution consists of concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

“If my children didn’t want wars, there would be none.” – Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have arisen.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right to self-defense and embeds the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and denounces Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the periodically repeated killings and who is the victim; after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look at who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
In every epoch we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who guided their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone oriented their actions toward a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this entails has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Oh, of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds’ Bank of America central bank, began printing money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their quest for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (as many slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume as many resources as possible) in addition to the creation of the world.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crises and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the one of 1907 does not repeat itself.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a hidden way, a conflict situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds spearheaded the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration above laid the foundations for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place began.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the State of Israel the focal point for a third war was created.
If the international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of battle, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of your country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their craving for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the world.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the wealthy financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two front fingers, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: If It Gets Crude, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students took the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since if it did, it would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within his reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which garnered little success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated tour, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a covert story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction overproduction.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a royal office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And more, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town.
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the take of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn’t all come out so elegantly (the scene of the crisis at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its trail become insane).
The weakness of Argo is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be pursued with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for Inflating Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulations or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Pravo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the increase in prices.
Critics have criticized the factual ban on the use of the term "butter" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonize the national standards that have not been homogenized to date, which only made their marketing more difficult.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails food waste.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s U.S. prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death from asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegrass by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, posing a substantial fine threat.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of payments to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of grain was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU) and is specifically intended for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, and the EU's efforts to regulate and also to operate and develop more effectively across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, as are other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it was called "tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official EU list of protected designations of origin, together with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the German city of Lübeck masap<0xC3><0xA1>n or the Parma ham, there are already, for example, the Karlovy Vary cookies, the Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and even the <0xC5><0xBD>ebo<0xC4><0x8D> variety of lupul.
As EU protected mares, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice barklets in Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I wouldn’t be running for president.
But I can no longer bear to see how thieves have been robbed in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are left unpunished, taxes are increased and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after, it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this are added the media, which desecrate you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists that I have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guiding profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or the left, they are deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he a man of the right or a man of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of a leftist.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is on the right or on the left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDGs, and I will likewise be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when people say you're a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, there are only slogans left.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things right myself, but in case it doesn’t work out, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that's why I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they were encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who brought out the frauds with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the intact past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I value my private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there’s not too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money from my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign essentially cover what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run.
So you will continue your business activity in order to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly abandoned my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want him to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I were president, then I would leave business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who walks down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town just outside Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, bears the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time as cynical, took the topic with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here is my proposal for Spijkenisse’s mountain of books, the so-called ‘Boekenberg’.
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises in the intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town without history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a central dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese box.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to grasp with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant headlights unmistakably support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually something uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers most of the day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until plates of four centimeters thick were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden ridges located transversely to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to shade and absorb most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, the Chinese professor of traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved quite a success in that royal discipline that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated you may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather troubled diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
What's wrong with that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they’ve already started the way to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from the Arab public opinion or the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance because it’s not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps this has earned Germany some respect for itself.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not actually have the scale that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a tricky topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or do you find it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany finds itself in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

"Mark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a repository in which it holds seats from Beijing’s trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature; on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities don’t feel guilty
“It’s bad for the business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are multimillion-dollar, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registration is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The process can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name in question had already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a blue and white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth year in a row, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in rights would have been pocketed.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg the right, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler hoped that the matter would be resolved in a favourable manner and commended the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure euro sum" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten to even affect Europe.
In particular, if imitators secure rights over unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial field, however, it managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark law, but what needs to be done is to "record also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject may prove to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a link capable of crossing much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly begin to rise (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), whirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his box by trying to put things in order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school enrollment, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "panegirista".
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years old has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Scabies and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, about 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don’t offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend that you undergo regular medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
She takes care that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and take care of the children come to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has launched a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite how patently this disease is across the country, it is not usually openly talked about.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable temporary workers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “In any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; such recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear away a couple of tears from some angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population hardly appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River valley it is well known.
“Close to Esitjeni, there is light,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is likely to be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably from comets or, most likely, asteroids that collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says lead researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromanticly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This tornado image of a dying star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helical Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacularly colorful.
This swirling star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images taken by the Hubble telescope: the Milky Way Galaxy.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the clues to a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion swinging toward each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light-years is composed of dust particles the size of which is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, contributing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It is not expected to be able to take pictures until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located at Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers base that there is ice in the south pole of Mercury as well.
However, there is no credible evidence, as the Messenger probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great rush through the winding road that passes next to forested hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "Talyshi", a people of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit quite into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World's Oldest People," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, instead believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the Talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, he tirelessly moves a huge vat of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two young children also play from side to side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that they serve in typical cups with a domed shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly discovers.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life I have never shopped in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, it all came back to a head when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyev, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the nation’s paternal figure, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness ceded to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s son is right: “In our culture, the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution there is no “human rights”
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations rivaling each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division into which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as the basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not shy away from patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hitherto unresolved in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost begging forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its “to be able to save the revolution.”
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean for "principles"?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuvering it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article the state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing more than censorship.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the wording that prohibits "offensive to people"
Is a cartoon of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
“The revolution is back.”
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in the Tahrir del Cario square and swore to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the list in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the rubbish bin of history.”
Through Twitter, he accused Morsi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup d’état against democracy.”
“When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to hold a counter-demonstration; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it, shouting: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi “clean the country,” while proclaiming, “The Koran is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk such a thing happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and supporters of the same would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the term 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warned: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
The Norwegian rakfish: the most stinky fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has anything to do with its greed for an extremely stinky fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of wet and dirty football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the crisp aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfish is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how odourful you prefer.
As it gets darker and colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfish,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different from a portion of sushi that you’ve traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and in which, before cooling existed, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
The rakfish is considered an important part, an essential but rather odourful part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the 10<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ($14) frill each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“Oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks past rakfish trays and that, with her long blonde mane and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, a people who are wise.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that they didn’t have in the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfish," he adds with a squeaky twist.
I’m in the snow lining up to eat something; I’ve already had enough rakfish.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel I stay at is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who wears a birdie and is surrounded by rakfish dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad at the moment.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel siege has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week at the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before coordinating with the U.S. President, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism on the spot and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and full of bumps that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern multi-sports and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he can make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, deputy of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted 81-year period in power, the PRI was bankrupted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women killed have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorating neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I got home, it looked like his body had been cleaned," Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says he’s been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me like an old gossip, a riot, a complaint.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential party that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says the PRI Olvera deputy in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to address allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted on Manning in a pre-trial view in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence’s request to dismiss the case given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In Friday’s view, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after Manning’s visits during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers reportedly asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the bailiffs as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities generally as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, despite officers asking Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and had told him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
“They were writing ‘no incidents’ (after talking about the issues) but that doesn’t necessarily mean I didn’t mention any issues,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
“I wanted the senior staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a few slingshots, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move around all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jailers and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given by the janitor that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic bandage on his underwear or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, panties and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she went through during her stay in prison and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to all detainees who are in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely descended the esplanade and reached the immigration processing zone and was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was going.
Growing up in Central California, all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It’s ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends refer to themselves as “Italian”.
I later opted for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have a native vocabulary level and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico’s President-elect, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, were: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely for a Mexican to stay in Mexico as it is for him to venture to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to the tip of a gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, still, as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more firmly who they are and the latter this annoys them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they’re not part of either one.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American comrades how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city of Jemen.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that their lethal deadlock situation could be unleashed.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 remains, this week’s clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, claim to have forced Israelis to retreat, despite Gaza having received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless Fatah rivals, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamic crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’ cousins and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven to be effective and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects illegal Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite, according to international legislation, the Palestinian Authority said in a statement.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good thing and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel’s assignment of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the issue should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to dedicate his attention to her.
This attitude represents a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The Tobacco Packaging Act comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on green off-colored boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia’s world-leading tobacco and generic packaging law comes into force and replaces logos and brand colors with a wrapper of an olive-green off, scary images of diseased body parts, and depictions of sick children and babies as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of font.
This is the most stringent regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit have glamour.
It relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never do so.
“You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes won’t affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more affordable.
“The legislation will bring serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that the demand for pickpockets and silicone covers to cover the nasty pictures of the cartridges had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a lawsuit in court.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign websites.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews about brands from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on what the new regulations imply than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite none of these countries having a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the cassettes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“You take the cigarette and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumour in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack dam in central Sydney, says that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unwind a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it’s, okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving party, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good way?
Oh, yeah.
And no, I don't.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and raising the idea before a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to engage in an activity that fills you.”
He argues that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Uningaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television program that had no connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the program with the volume low showed more boredom than the other two groups; they found it difficult to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, altered attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scratching, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boring tendency scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do it all.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescence is a period where boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance use as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“ Boredom is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to better control himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something worth it,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and football player in southeastern Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke her.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (small crimes each involving a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana offenses are being quashed here as well as in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution, and sales licenses—all before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
The Washington law, dubbed I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year in which to swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to provide “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition to conduct cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s play areas or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Aurora’s chief of police, Oates, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop suing people over the age of 21 for minor misconduct due to marijuana possession and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing city regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offences that were a crime at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding possession cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use to the government and the judiciary would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with the district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time bringing people to court that, in fact, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
By being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become nationally tested cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still envisages considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will yield.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
“Although it is likely that anti-drug agents will not throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're studying what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford because I was a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any time in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in History, I had already packed up, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had given up because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in squashed cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration turned out to be somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that's all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred for Conservative students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s JCR (Grade Students’ Group) claim that they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unappreciative people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s Equal Opportunities Committee to make sure they can freely express their views.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which featured the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated like “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing leftist trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old elected president of the OUCA, says JCR members’ attitude toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to be translated into English French texts from the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next.
“Mrs. Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
Not one of them.
Pitt, a lowly man with a face that looked like cake mass, knew how to expel bad bile.
“Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to hold back.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grumbled.
I returned to my room like a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime in college; then I felt a slight slap in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They get involved with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour.
Later, in a local pub, I cowardlyly tried to cover it up.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
"They beat each other, didn't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a laborer and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
He was hated not only by the Conservative party, but also by Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
It was just over there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded, metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there between my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left it."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional endurance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had insinuated, in all seriousness, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed me” and called them “old fools.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
At that time my father was writing two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was inside in fear, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak cry.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind a reputation not deserved for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentine: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social advancement: from the humble modist of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty is not a bad thing.
“At least they don’t turn off their beaks on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the fashionista.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel your spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture Week in Paris, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous walkway of sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade along the walkway to contemplate a "audience" of dream that wears masterpieces of Valentino, like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose on her wedding dress.
In that audience of mannequins shine names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine’s Day is like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he made me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," she said.
I really like the colors it uses, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she wore a Valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with ruffled skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashionista calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four and a half meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Obscured for years with the elite’s “savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre”, Valentino is now his best.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani amasses as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“I’ve always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its beautiful and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg says.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The World's Toughest Trade: Kawah Ijen's Human Mules
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano play with life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies by coming into contact with the air.
After ripping out large rocks of sulfur, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that loads on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at the pace of a turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their steps with a zeal not to slip and fall through the cliff.
They know that any traspié could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who got away years ago with the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters in height.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, to its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours on each and ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery to such inhumane effort, it is three times what you would earn in the field.
"The newspaper of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", clarifies the porter, who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where she is translating to the Hindus, and I have the
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing with his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass him the bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy log cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop roaring at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater, lighting a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load sulfur baskets onto their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supplies any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at so much weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, together with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old self-sufficient carrier who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working “everything he can” because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and peels the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works with sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for having no children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe in life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or maybe because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “his national duty.”
This is something purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to a “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to deal with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where there is barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate firm EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units deplete days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards raising the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the centre’s financial district does not seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private life or "the sphere of private life that one has the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venting situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn’t share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on the personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets would not upload them to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a picture other than mine, or of someone who’s making fun of me,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, of nude people, of crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just bring them up," he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
Do not hesitate to reply that you would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has accounts open on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in which he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded me to do so, I would simply take them out of my account,” he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"It just gave him privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I feel bad or I'd like it.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, Master in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“Also let them be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you label photos of parties, did you ask permission from other people to label them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they have to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Anyone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read social media policies consciously.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant presidents, being made public.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency indicated at first that they were going to hand it over after the closure, but later stated that it will be published on the Peruvian Government's website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Access by journalists to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was transmitted in the press room.
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press representatives of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about the statement of Humala, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On ASPA’s official website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that broadcasting systems were insured for all journalists but limited the collection of information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Hague Court that would rule a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will respect and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held with the non-attendance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects among South American countries were set for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residency agreements."
He said that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to broaden our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a failure of the ICC, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but are now practically a homeland".
He defended, in this sense, the project to establish South American citizenship that encourage the member countries of Unasur.
“We have to get the free mobility of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Teachers never commit to anything, and instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said in reference to Ecuador’s political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because it did not betray its principles, but respected its "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for requiring it to be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian president said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a conduit bailout that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the Wikiak founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a number of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he said that "if Britain gives the safe passage tomorrow, this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over.
Correa reasserted himself as an advocate of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and wicked politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it was no longer the bankers, nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominated Ecuador, and said that if he was re-elected, he would “deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup-style legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that mistake is not being made.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime boundaries that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how hard it may be".
Referring to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and that’s where we left public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to have tested positive for AIDS.
“It was as if I had dropped a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make it “softer,” with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
She decided to take care of her illness alone and began to inform herself about it; with such an effort that she already celebrated her 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he brought a cut.”
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, still many people arrive when the virus has already caused havoc, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least the first cases reported, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to a press release that this information was approved in April.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who do not have a CD4 and 30 years with drugs:
In simple words, the above means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while staying in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make diagnoses earlier and therefore have to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it.”
In his proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done so a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a common tumor that is cancerous.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die already, I’d better fight back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that they sooner know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapat<0xC3><0xAD>o journalist who has taken over the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has effectively increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorority and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be just behind the counters and that 100 of them should be in public toilet dispatchers from places frequented by young people.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chalas and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied, when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of contagions correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as for a recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. court of appeals a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a dire precedent for any domestic company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contravention of international conventions.
In practical terms, the backdrop to the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of embargoing their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceeding is the commercial tender processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve not knowing about international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts held by the subsidiaries of Vitro with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, the "foreign" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards to overwhelm the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, sticking its collections to the country.
Soon, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family's signature will file a reconsideration appeal before the Court of Appeals itself so that the vote reaches the plenary session of the Court of Appeal, i.e. the five judges, given that only three voted.
If it does not prosper, Cerciorare’s appeal will be sought, requiring a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court overturned a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that he dissipated with adhesion to the agreements signed by both countries to tie the United States to the Ban of the United States.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they beat Vitro and beat the country.

Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sales and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing at the forefront for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that it razed with part of protected areas and raises the mother of all maggots against the industry.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Trotamundos of basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of the history of local basketball as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, either as a minor player, National Higher Basketball player, a BSN manager with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put on many basketball hats throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a first-time visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.
Kings do not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest emotion are those who remember his passing by the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 acting as a co-powered or a proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, whether as a co-owner, co-owner or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year at BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have you a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, as by 1988 it was already included in the most federative.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic Games in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players by the mess of the Pan-American Sea of Silver, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was definitely Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered that level like Piculin.
And that’s not to mention his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
I'm glad of that.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predator oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new "Dallas" season, died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producing house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him so much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly loathsome J.R. that brought Hagman to his climax.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", intended to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and risky millions of dollars at bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to beat her up as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want in J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only trade he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Friday Hagman as someone “huge, on and off screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
The recording of five of the episodes for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner and TNT about how the series would handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatrical stages in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then later," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but you'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the latest in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the Haddonfield, New Jersey, Religion and Sociology career in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of consolation.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’d never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said he believed in the expiration date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple, West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
