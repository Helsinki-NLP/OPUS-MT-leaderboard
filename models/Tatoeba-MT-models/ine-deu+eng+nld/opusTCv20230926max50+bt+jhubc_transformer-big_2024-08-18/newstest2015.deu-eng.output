Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defense cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before taking off to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the driver's description were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal and ruthless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was indicted at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was “sleeping, unconscious, and unable to signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
“Just as trade unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law provides workers with the same legal opportunities for discrimination due to the organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Supplementing the national labour law to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice – and to obtain damages or penalties – is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to unite in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to narrow it are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other writers made a guarantee to them that "everyone has the right to protect unions."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union – and to have that union then participate in collective bargaining as equal partners with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to re-examine the American ideal, which means that the working people must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can still legally perform abortions temporarily while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are striving to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Proponents of abortion welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors were spending so much more time getting hospitalization rights.
“Today’s decision means that the women of Louisiana are escaping a cunning law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for injunctions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Proponents of abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say unanimously that doctors’ rights of instruction require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents, on the other hand, argue that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient referral rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In her argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs Could Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers examined the women’s medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing pre-existing conditions, and social and economic status also influenced her chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances somewhat, as a possible remedy, she proposed an increase in the service of inflight doctors, to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographic status, found a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer, underscoring the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining numbers of homeowners
The decline, along with a sharp decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products” according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year is put into sale.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a 6-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting homes or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden adviser for RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when moving.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after adverse weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state-run television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now transmitting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they delivered themselves clashes with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been cleaning up more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in May’s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to invade Sharif’s residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey Appoints U.S. Diplomat Over Espionage Report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has hired the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those from the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a main area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that even Germany’s most important intelligence service was targeting Ankara caused much more outrageous reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The schedule announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. covers all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL) trade union, Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant downtimes.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW has announced that it will do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Magaluf Police Chief Charged with Corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Binge-Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor for combating corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the authorities’ cousin economy was having a serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Let's get our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made an international headline this summer following a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing Fellatio on 24 men during a soup tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants on the notorious alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FRÜHLING has provided South Australia with a wintery surprise, with fierce squalls and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The buoyant weather conditions are likely to have led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set off at about 20.40 hours.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16°C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: It’s high time to network big
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I’m writing this, my eyes are on the spiral cable connecting the listener to the phone, and I’m thinking, “Boah, how retro is that?”
But there is a consideration behind it: if the cable were not, all the listeners would be flying around the house in no time at all, and that would be even more retro.
What about the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you just say that you fundamentally reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because pushing the Ifa on the radio tower this week again brings our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics to our attention.
The layman, who once blindly mastered washing machines and CD players, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incomprehensibly elusive expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What to talk about with people who seem to be spreading such quark voluntarily?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we are supposed to network our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire detector on holiday in the Maldives tells us that it burns grad in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we went from the office to the air conditioning to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioner.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot starts.
Irre.
Everything turns out to be nothing less than a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods are blurring", says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but we do not use anything in the staging.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli Children Return to Schools After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air defenses as rocket and mortar shelling descended on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza were shut down.
The school start brought a sense of joy and anticipation to communities in the south of Israel drawn by rocket-propelled holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the pupils shell fragments from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and a local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza that is heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s air and seaports.
Israel calls for Hamas to disarm and hand over the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school is reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU vice-president Strobl questions NPD ban procedure
In view of the NPD’s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU Vice President Thomas Strobl has spoken out for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing banning proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU country chief in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that will lead me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had almost failed at the five-percent hurdle in Sunday’s vote.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because constitutional protection at that time also had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the federal parliament did not join.
Harburg: Tent for new refugees
At Neuländerplatz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central reception for refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now the Interior Ministry has had three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were informed only a short time before - they are not very enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions further aggravate citizens’ reservations and do not give district politicians a chance to contribute constructively to the humanitarian accommodation of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, chairwoman of the Green Group in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the onslaught of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homeowners in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research leader, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rise by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by just 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test".
“If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise even further over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to this, to pose "like a fielder".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the university’s intentions.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preliminaries or even decisions", but that there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
Of a nine-metre wide road was and is not the talk.
It is 5.50 meters at the current level, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future does not want Pötzl to be valid.
The train is not parked at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the locals
The Bergwichtel nursery, which is located on the grounds and in front of whose front door the access to the park deck would lead, according to the president of the university, "is not to be affected".
Rather, it should be borne in mind that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich-Streif-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the nursery, with the expansion of the road would be lost to one of "the few natural areas of Coburg" is justified, "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week.
Accordingly, the access for the new park deck is not to be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streif-Straße, but via the Medau-Berg.
In order to do this, the narrow road would have to be extended two-lane to a length of about one kilometre.
According to the calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
We are talking about about 2,000 vehicles a day.
So far, the city has not commented on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led for this decision mainly health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to my body's signals and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany, he retires internationally.
Because the throw-throwing back-to-back player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on goal-hunting for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will thrill my long-time players and successors.
But for my club I want to be available healthy in the next few years, for this I need longer regeneration breaks, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had to worry about his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a severe inflammation.
One emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can’t ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf explained in an interview with Handball Time magazine.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the knits are torn, I'm always ready to talk," the double-parent told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble when it comes to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises around the world slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year start, the first half of the year has resulted in a GDP plus of 0.8% compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Munsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion by Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the Münsterland.
Published in various trade journals, this tour was offered to those interested.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the Münsterland in this way”, the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering in the association home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where the launch took place.
Further, the route, which was offered for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1,175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1,475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1,775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and Deputy Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," concludes Heinz Lölfing.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the poor weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully good weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland, and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought pieces for thought pieces, the Münchner, born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a corresponding song text.
And he is relentlessly honest: From masturbation as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness out.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Wide spaces also include abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was shaped not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But between all the high-spirited views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about beatings in a local frequented by GI's or a crazy car ride, in which he aimed at a tree frontally.
He is also relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were adults when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket pitch.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he still gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly start singing because he could wash the foundry off of himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ affections.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
It wasn’t until the end of my mother’s life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you please stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don’t regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-old award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing the time or stepping a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose, and a cabbage head in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had put my head right.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was good, too, so it's like a big sign from the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERING voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is plagued by humorous outbursts while imitating people over and over again.
I’ve decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for that, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don’t get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle, and the end of a journey – I don’t think I’d ever want to give that up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met, the paper said.
The Shia Houthis fight for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the government’s resignation.
The Houthis have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on Sanaa’s main access roads.
In the surrounding area, bloody fighting with the Yemeni army continues.
Kenya registers officials to curb 'spiritual employees'
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all state officials to remove “spiritual employees” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month was lost in payments to “spiritual workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric records are recorded, a government message said.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll.
“This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government – thus eliminating the ‘spiritual employees’,” said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach is being negotiated in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings in a civil lawsuit at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
According to the complaint, Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht charged higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He served 44 years in the school service, including 23 as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his quest to see people in the student.
The snow cap is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
Thus, judges fled to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a chance to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years as a teacher, he took the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss-room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to escape a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had an additional workshop and basements built during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who had responded to a speech by a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter translated what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work out." Whether he's just talking about his students or his own six children, it's not entirely clear.
In any case, Judges' doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves up, they didn’t get any criminal work from him, and they weren’t even given to sit back.
At the expense of the community, the judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a violet.
For the sake of the school, Judge as Rector maintained a good relationship with then-Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge after his retirement to nominate at least the last one on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Judge was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of pauses made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour, accompanied by truss, enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Biking and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by the mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, dip, spread and cheesecakes, which made the skilful cyclists wonderful.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the beverage stand of the gym club Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and garnered enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, finally he has reattached already skipped bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the head of the company still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa of reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as a tour leader, could only snoop briefly, after all he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle staff of the Hessian police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but cyclists have also travelled from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left again after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and of course you had prepared delicacies, such as flame cake with well-cooled feather white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly delighted by the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance floor.
The opportunity for swinging in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, more and more citizens were mixed, who were as attracted by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb – including a concert with the Trenkwalder – were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media outlets report.
The police did not make any direct comment.
Among the detainees are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethullah Güllen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September festivities were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud tow of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own frontline experience.
She began her career with global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of Pearson’s parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was reportedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk stepping in, hitting on everything, and dealing with an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking care of himself?
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money and status outdated.
As the competition gets closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 per year, the British public buys into the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96% of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news feeds on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and notable institution.
She needs a sizable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas Says Decreasing Tweet Wasn't Authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a declining remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry’s user account, which denies the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and I deleted it,” it said in a later post.
Perry employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial promotion from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who may be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry if he plaudits it.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not in charge of the Grand Jury’s investigation of Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special counsel from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His top-notch team of legal advisors asked the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law that is being prosecuted against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funding to the state’s Public Integrity Unit – which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto resulted in a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in Iowa during his 2012 presidential run, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal"
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeast England had “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought after and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable environment for action”.
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the recession as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cadastre Office, prices in the urban area alone jumped by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, low-cost, and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "village tax" ahead of the general elections in May.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage lending in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the 2015 London property price rise to 3%, based on already weakening home price awareness.
Transaction volumes in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, futures sales have also remained stable.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – almost a third more than its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, sales by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley in the current year would likely be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax earnings at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley shares were trading in London at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of "glaring breach of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will track down all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan, were allegedly obtained by a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary.
It’s not sure how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoryous" dispute that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are faked, people.
Let’s start with the beginning. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokeswoman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They disintegrated, so you could best describe it, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard that you have left standing in the rain.
Occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew scratching brushes.
He was a squirrel, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stubbornness was an affair just beginning, which had been more promising for a relief from the lonely boredom of his life than any other, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a moist but paradisiacal valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the bathrooms, snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all of them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken lounge chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had paused in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, while he liked to squint at the sight of their crippled al.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have succeeded, and just as people in books chose the From dishwashing to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing big feet in a coarse-comic serenade by Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game back then, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “if” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gifting - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WHEN IT HAPPENED WAS - for fear of being charged with arson, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had been exposed to the Labneh-Phefen and the Shinneh-Reffen.
Each according to his abilities.
Having only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just said to her could ever be rehearsed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a bit strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else in the whole world to see but her un combed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that still doesn't explain why you're planning it for me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm one needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
In spite of his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her recliner, tossed the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
“And your dickhead is exactly the reason I feel pervertedly drawn to you,” she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sordid after what had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or ridiculed them.
- Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a big fist if she hadn't been careful!
They first knit - knitting was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspoken love ballads from the console - they first knitting and then beating.
In Kevern's opinion, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the Knutschen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the bed like an old man.
She also felt bleached, but the intensity of her grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he walked away from a room upstairs, as her companion looked at him, a man complaining about something he himself had summoned.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit—why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
A few years before the events just reported, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium levels, the most important of which were spent in the regions of the country.
"A great deal has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to alleviate the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been seen to be seldom questioned historically despite the heightened turmoil.
But some properties are inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population cries when listening to sentimental ballads, is intoxicated with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only the former rudeness keeps the rural communities as well as our urban structure firmly on a street, but there is also a new place to stay and work.
“You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
“I don’t ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental workplace.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call “backstage” and “raw” could be interpreted by others as just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue on the path of WHAT IS HAPPENING, IF IT IS HAPPENING, as if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday, means to take away from the country its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter century or so.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of it," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we pretend to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have only led to what has happened when it has happened.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we leave out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In other words, an English patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “if you call actions “mistakes” that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about them leaving out their “anger” and their “mistrust” of “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From him, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to refute, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is no need to say anything more - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt needs to be attributed, so no guilt needs to be repaid if such remission would be appropriate and if there was a way to remit it.
But what does the past mean if we don't learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I may say anything about it--
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on foot in a sort of “brutal rage.”
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country’s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup, but that the military responded to the threat from "political fanatics" whose armament was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were elements inside the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to inflict devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have ripped the government apart by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
A spokesman for Lesotho’s military said on Sunday that the soldiers were withdrawing to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unified government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Procurement Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell in August to 50.7 in, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced break-ins at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are set before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi could provide further details over the course of this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as does Italy’s decline from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism no longer apply in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The industry’s decline is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say for the August Eurozone Producing Industry Purchasing Manager Index is that after that, the sector continues to grow.”
“Producers in the Eurozone find life at the moment obviously quite difficult, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch some sort of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Decade of Hell of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in abhorrence, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war which is now visiting Ukraine – and in which children like them die – will now come to an end.
The girl who was photographed while trying to climb back into the destroyed school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she was only trying to climb back into the destroyed school sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have surgery again.
Some grenade chips are still in my knee.
Your goal now is to become a dentist to help people as you have been helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“That happened to me and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and contribute to such a thing not happening again.
The boy who ran through the bullet hole, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, “Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she might be dead, he ran away and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her hand and ran through a bullet hole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, on the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, “I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I know I threw away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially at the toy store where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car above.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And this is how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the atrocities of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodthirsty face was marked by fear as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had set him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgiy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People study such tragedies over and over again and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing like that pain.
It takes us tens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my childhood friend.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service agent, but could not because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB’s secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, even the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this, and of course they should not suffer.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgie won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept when something like this happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's had multiple surgeries, he can run, but he can't play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only intensifies my pain.
I have lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajeva, 10
The baby so grippingly carried in safety by a special duty command
Rescued: Aljona Tskajeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty they held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“You’re a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Overstepping Girl on Pedestrian Pass in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl at the Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, retracts the charge before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC commenced the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is up and running.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you’ll see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthetic consultant, he dedicated his career to saving the patient both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and illnesses, while those treated are predominately concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel it,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time getting up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently making accusations to his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather have everything immediately than later,” he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the skin of the chest, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which was once considered a "miracle material" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged not to use it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carers and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the climax of a mesoltheliome epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as from traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and probable future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present, in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations, or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no refuge.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, we have already been made the starting point for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years training," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my co-workers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long period of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma cases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are still going to get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, if the UK asbestos epidemic is expected to subside, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die this way.

A brief look at the records of the courts, to which the victims often turn because of claims for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of the mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof slabs, floor slabs, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "great health risk" with a possible fatal outcome.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear, but indirect, evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment at work or at home."
Many of these contacts are based on the “normal use and aging” of our buildings.
It seems that no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service sheds and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster have received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work must be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernize electrical installations and remove asbestos from its premises.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively resolved,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation late at night.
All of a sudden I had a chill.
It came all of a sudden.
I just felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleura catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt sick, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I wasn’t so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
He is still being removed today.
Students put their bun burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their bun burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs have included asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in much of our real estate,” notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden sheds.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
The biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to capture all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That was it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it’s our life-support mechanism—breathing itself—that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the peel, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothorax physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is precisely the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos that is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly contested.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The treasure denies it.
"You can't cut out the breast fur," he says.
They don't come around with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but doesn't cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for those involved four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in not having to be forwarded, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-value compensation", as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients striving for compensation, a huge problem is attributing deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million insurance industry-sponsored fund for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal damages process could have accrued to them - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represented a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal from insurers to insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn’t passed and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then-Minister of Labor and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven fatalities, rapid action was needed daily.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“This is, of course, the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is seen again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
It's life-threatening.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumor is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You need to think about practical things — about the money when I’m gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and naughty.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, China’s parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate, despite the growing call for democratic reforms.
This move is presumably fueling the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to the streets within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Peking loyal candidates.
“It doesn’t come unexpectedly, but it still makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s chairman.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK relinquished control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has pledged to let its people elect the presidency in 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a tightly controlled Beijing nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong took place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
Within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and there were tightened security measures in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland intensifies competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement’s demonstrations as endangering Hong Kong’s business operations – the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause major economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will go out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists staged an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people – more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the US is now being transferred to the universities, where freshmen are offered performances by private jet.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said no new bookings have been proposed yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also announced that despite the <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year tuition fees, it expects a market for this offering.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who begin their studies this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest basics of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists Criticize Racial Issue and Police Behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” as they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles like “Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” came relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find a lot of people in feminism who are about being white and talking privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems to which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public safety?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleanly separating the themes; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now combine the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women’s suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to advocate for women’s suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become powerfully aware of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to Ferguson's questions of police conduct, racial discrimination, is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems that black women have been grappling with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to conceive control?" he asked.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are clearly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism that addresses race as well as gender issues, some of her comments on race in America are still astounding.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson stand in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that is pressing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform also surfaces again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a rethinking of the topic as an essential women’s topic, they only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“These speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a echo in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Among the details was an illustration of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Realtor Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly published and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lotto player from Harvey is on his way this month.
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner getting nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the profit will provide conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a proper conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had made the mega-gain of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiator Arena
It wasn’t just the gladiators who stood in the mud on the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rainshowers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman times and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for the heroic duel in various gladiator guilds.
At first, the "provocateurs" were in line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and throwing plant as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who went against the "Secutor" with a throwing net, a tripod and a dagger and, after a short fight, knocked the boys to the ground.
There the swords metallic force each other, the shields created and the wreaths flew surrending through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on it.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman Canal Bridge, which was once near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once confronted the water and energy supply and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge from that time".
This is also confirmed by graduated surveying engineer Ralph Heiligener from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints that were left by wolf and fox in the footsteps of clay two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Soil Care at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
They found encircling walls of an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and for milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations presented her in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a decorative necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the fall of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards as they once did.
At the stand of the Roman Thermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach to make glass mosaics and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to use a heavy stone wheat mill to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original Roman carriage, faithfully rebuilt by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014 proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership club and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remind the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the nearby Wachtberg, plants as living monuments from the Roman era and a funny lesson in the matter of understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made visible again.
In the Wachtberg City Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are going a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are abandoned - the virus has hardened the region.
Some international companies are also already moving a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells Monrovia clothing on Liberia’s second-largest market.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola will come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people dying of fever here alone.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have died.
Foreign companies are pulling out employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies expand their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, have rotted in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa’s economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
Stocks of basic foods such as rice are dwindling in the markets.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatening image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest, warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to provide $60 million (45 million euros) to the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go down significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding of Tannenwald from 12 to 14 September run on high tours.
On Friday, September 12, there will be a big evening of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big böllershooting.
Then there is the "Stoaffälzer Spitzbuam" in the large festive tent of the mood evening.
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sundays are the feast service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the big feast at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Guardian Society Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on March 21 the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room stud and small caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 at the Lukas Gasthaus raised the "new" shooter club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter champion through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's records were broken every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the membership numbers positively developed.
After the clubhouse "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooter club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988, Pastor Strasser gave the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschuss, associated with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenflag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a böller group was formed.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Böllerertreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year, bringing the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round-robin competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the shooter club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one KK1 sports pistol, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as boulders, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivities in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart is in an accident when he returns to the race track.
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to reporters.
Team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed but now focused on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We are going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities announced on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has been made as to whether Stewart should face charges.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had already advanced to the top 10 shortly after and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs ran
Cars with the No. 18 out of control after exiting curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for a dance-freudiger youngster
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to competing.
Like many other clubs, the jazz group in TV Jahn is creating full-day classes at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now, youngsters are increasingly looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can enter the training class on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
“Training starts regularly with a warm-up program,” says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the sociability is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we have already spent the night in the dance hall," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not like that, you can also sneak into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always sneak into the classroom on Wednesdays in the areas of children’s dance/jazz, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come by and join us.
Bulgarian prison inspectors protesting nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison workers’ union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of sanctions, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The protest of the prison employees is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
The Ukrainian army has abandoned the airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coast guard boats in the Asov Sea for the first time.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships were shot down near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were found to be missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several towns in the Donetsk region under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make their demand public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO is sticking to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a crude breach" of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, it emerges that "they consider us as opponents".
Strengthening NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A readiness action plan to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed, according to official information, on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are set for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says power word: toll will come "very clear"
The Chancellor has made this clear once again.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have infuriated the CSU.
After persistent opposition from her CDU, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not set out a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and it is now being worked on".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its “no” to a toll equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is reviewing its own concept to compensate highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
“The coalition agreement never presupposes that it will pave all the circuit and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional charges under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll through the motor vehicle taxes.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality according to EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are presumably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure gait, and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Peaceful Ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I fell all the time and everything lasted longer.
I was never able to ride skateboard or skateboard with the other kids and was often harassed at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities hadn’t gone as bad as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was determined.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, no more shots have been fired at the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly munitions still appear every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
An ear-wrenching bang radiates from the blasts over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Munsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500 hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax filings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of modest declines in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more strongly than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
At 28 percent, Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective at increasing state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not increase evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax return of 4.1 percent.
At 6 percent, Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three jurisdictions (in all three, there are firm corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia, and overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen — a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by — in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general multi-defense tax revenues for the state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Still, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city,” Li Yiwei, deputy party secretary for the southern Chinese metropolis, said this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back in the course of the conversation on this issue of the 12 million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also possessed the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"Beer doesn't need much: good water, grains and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exudes Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou came in with a shepherd's snout - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German law of purity.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Deputy Party Chief Li said.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities is increasing further".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour through Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
Guangzhou’s secretive vice party chief hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this function.
He did not take office until this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is being vehemently enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese union was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors keep them intentionally sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6" apply sharper nitrogen oxide values.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros nationwide.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a host of other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravoure pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better knowledge gives the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports than watch it, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn’t a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men being promoted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was already evident on early Sunday evening, when the first visitors came to the Open Air.
A festival for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply stalls on the castle garden meadow, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings had made themselves cozy.
They watched the first live performances, swiped with their feet in rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were on the agenda.
And that across generations.
While some were snorkeling on blankets on the extra-thin white sand at the beach bar, others were snorkeling at a quarter of wine in the winery, the youngsters were toasting on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children's make-up, the volunteer helpers, in the truest sense of the word, had to fill all their hands to become masters of the urge and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he nodded at the visitors, especially families were looking for the wide and dry.
However, the attractiveness of the festival did not make this a nuisance.
“There were more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, speaking of a “success on the whole line.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular vote.
As annoying, he pointed out that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the premises.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who swirled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire pan.
"Next year they will be there," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the numbers of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be lost on the first time, but must be eliminated on the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to insert criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"You've taken a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as very narrow.
I think it’s very good that some people not only chat stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Shut up!" writes Stephanie Jenss to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
This is not expected to be the case.
Rather, the ready-to-wear component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The final step to completing the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old casing is cut off and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is placed.
If the weather does play a role, the action is expected to take place on stage earlier this week.
A participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge gets jaw-dropped
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went along painfully.
A woman was taken to the hospital after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ripped off her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stayed standing,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it was not possible, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and laughed almost into their pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was taken to hospital to have her jaw reincarnated after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull back on a string?
The last time there was a fight between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could come together one day," Sjöberg reports.
In his opinion, all the members of both clubs could again pull on a string in the future.
Thus, visible successes can be recorded more quickly.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until recently had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "development and revival" of the terrain is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle's friends.
A new chairman is to be found at a meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club's activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how to proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find themselves." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to work on the project "but very much like to continue".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward and that a "all-setting feature" could be created for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to just throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the castle club may move somewhat at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is “important and good.”
After that you could see further.
Clever Ways to Save on University Tutorials
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever asparagus.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost-cutting options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time guide to the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price for which they are available online in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying used
If you don't care about the notes of other or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expense.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to the writing of notes, underlinings or usage tracks.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics nowadays can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as one can be so sure of finding the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Didn't Become a Cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed just $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", adapted for Cameron Diaz, earned only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Claws Made Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children's films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year ever" for children's films and described "dragon stitches made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, in films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of film visitors and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released jungle book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenues with streaming content amounting to $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hitters to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in box office results recently as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was abolished a few years ago for the purpose of tightening the league classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
For example, Göttingen's top-class Torpedo team in the Oberliga relegation avoided the descent, but only plays fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedo's women remain fourth-class, despite their grandiose breakthrough into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve enter the new Bundesliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger Klubs represented.
In the women's TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district Oberliga Süd.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete.
In the district league they play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here from the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
Also the district league staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly formed regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisliga start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the Eastern Staff.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the district level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd cycle classes achieve the target strength, here the innovative and extensive circuit board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flying out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwanders were brought to safety with the rope wind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govetts Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the pair were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were transported to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After about half an hour, the station resumed broadcasting.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about one kilometre from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence that there were again clashes between some 3,000 protesters and security forces on Monday.
According to hospital reports, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters tried to storm Sharif’s residence.
They are calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.
The powerful military called on Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict, “wasting no time and applying no violence.”
The statement said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has sparked concern about a military intervention that has been rampant in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially persisted peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to invade Sharif's residence.
Hutteldorfer placed third in the table after the second win of the season.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday ended for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who led Green and White to third place.
With the second win of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the national game break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute.
"I figured I'd snatch all the frustration out of Thursday and snatch it under the lattice," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the fast dress will therefore remain in special memory for him.
“For me, this is something very special, I’m from the Rapid junior class,” said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in the wrong mirror.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists this year," Barisic said.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
The guests could have written before that too.
“Thank God we were a bit lucky today,” said Schrammel, who pointed to the splitting of performance and result in recent weeks: “The results didn’t vote, but the playing field was always good compared to last year.”
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
He was not less pleased: "That we have finally played to zero again".
The fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting half debuts, also makes the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," said Barisic, who has lost in the last three days to Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The country game break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and add a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One of those who might be particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going over the pain.
It is precisely during this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal in the 68th minute.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't think that everything is good now" "We probably had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us too.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
Of course, he cautioned to concentrate on further work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly as we’ve played in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
At some stage, they are sticking to me," Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-strike "from the category of Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly ignored by the referee's colleague.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We had too few degrees.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
In general, there would have been more in it.
Under this tip there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle challenge of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen depicted is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A hollow footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes groups, basalt rock heaps and basalt rock lakes.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, protrudes beyond the other trees of the area and resembles an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheim Archive and interviewed elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what their relationship with the goosebumps is.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Accordingly, until about 80 years ago, goat herders were supposed to have driven their animals from under-white wells to the arduously rooted and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the herdsmen exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually return.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, caution should be exercised when entering the stone collections, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixion otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are signposted, climbing towards Hochrhön and inviting to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is being searched for in our next task, is rather rare in height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building clerk could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück"?

After weeks of rowing, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU President, Matteo Renzi, opposed strong conservative opposition at the EU’s special summit last week, forced the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy, to succeed Britain’s Catherine Ashton.
Renzi sees, as the close-to-government daily La Repubblica reports, the appeal of Mogherini, who is also considered a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing party base, which is always against him, because Mogherini is assigned to him - albeit rather in a moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, the prevailing opinion in Rome, so that a political balance is created.
At the same time, the EU's top diplomat will be Vice-President Juncker's deputy.
The approval of the European Parliament is considered to be secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, who have been in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for their ambition, will show themselves to the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 with a doctorate in political science in the youth organization of the then-Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged in 2008 with the Catholic center party Margherita to form the present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to be his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent of votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The EU's new foreign minister, who has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lacks substance, is being countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a "Russian-friendly course".
She supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos she showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices had previously attended primary and secondary schools and primary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years and the trainers will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should “shut up and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “their love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It is our duty to stand by his side,” he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a loosening of regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to “unite” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw sand into the gear, in which she appeared at a meeting of distraught socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "believing in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the Socialists’ constant struggles and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to emerge victorious in early elections and ready for the government.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment numbers.
“There’s a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise Just Ahead of $3 Billion Prestige Cruises Deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise liner in the world, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise liner owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly account for more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-faithful group hoisted the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that only allows two or three candidates for the 2017 leadership election in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Beijing-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the polls, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial hub with “occupy central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China’s predominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon in front of the top leadership office in Hong Kong.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not envisage any democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to open “statement talks” with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government cease fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate at eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists in seizing territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiysk to become independent with the All-Russian factual Una
In an interview with the state-run TV channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurusland", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glories of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups attack civilian communities in the separatist-held areas, hope for soon peace talks "are trapped in their illusions", Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskow said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification of the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s leadership’s claim to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict era gave a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects Russia’s territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inaugural speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the constitution, after new elections, which will give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and insurgency Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders at eye level came after another rebel advance last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azerbaijani Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Nowoasovsk, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to consolidate Mariupol, a steel-industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged for actions to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are nearing a point where there is no turning back,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said on Saturday.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped in the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal over Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no fuss about his anger about hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A-Family from Hollywood.
The film city is in turmoil after a series of unmistakable photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence popped up on the internet in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tributes of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne have reportedly also made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said the hack was “shameful” and that the affected felt “injured.”
The hacker allegedly has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying at the top without a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A Lawrence' representative told TMZ: "It's an abhorrent breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th Cycling on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery rode a bicycle on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily hide the small muscle caterpillar there, especially since the participation in the 8th Cycling on the Großen Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Little puffs on the go in the applause curve?
No, if I'd stopped once, it would've been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves in the mountains yesterday in the early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the well-eleven-kilometre-long stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circle – red dress, red bike – did something on understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there's a destination!"), but then he turned out to be half a pro on the mountain and went through the destination after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also passed the route in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokeswoman from the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to stamp on the height again immediately after.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at home at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
I also had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," Andreas Balzke said.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must have been, because he was on the "Fixie wheel", which are also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit prove that it was easy to climb without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a rope.
Bergwacht-Doktor Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel-drive bully and quad, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent on the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radling on the Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
